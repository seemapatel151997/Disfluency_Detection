it 's partly a judgment of how bad the recession is 
yeah 
it uh it would seem to me th- that there are other things that the administration could do 
well look first of all you look to the fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i think that 's been a positive development 
i think what that 's done is it 's it 's it 's helped keep inflation from um uh 
um-hum well at the moment we 're doing very well on inflation 
yeah 
exactly 
that 's the sort of upside to the deficit 
and it 's a sort of a piece of luck 
th- that 's the upside to the recession 
yeah um 
i do n't know 
what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term 
and the longer well can be done or will be done are two different things 
um at various places to look for for cutting the budget first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation 
sure 
but there are various other areas such as as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed 
ah a lot of entitlement programs like education aid i think ah they should 've put a in 
the reagan administrations took took took layoff such entitlements to the to the poor but left them for the middle class ah 
um-hum 
in the longer term ah we we we 'd do well i think to make to make uh reductions there 
also somewhat related is to collect money that 's owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed 
right 
i think that i i think that that i agree with you certainly in the second situation 
and i think certain entitlements i i 'm inclined to agree with you too 
education happens to be one place where i think that we would be foolish to um uh 
a lot of the education aid has gone to so called trade schools which are so there not colleges 
uh-huh 
but schools that teach you trades you know beauticians whatever at more and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition ah and the school gets paid off immediately ah they do n't provide very much education 
oh i see what you- i see what you 're saying 
and then the and then the people default on the loans 
and uh yes 
well i i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that uh around uh 
and i i i can n't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing 
but but but taking what you 're saying at face value then i would have to agree with you completely 
yeah 
lucille hughes 
okay 
lucille i 'm ron ron 
all right 
and what 
moore and our top- okay our topic was 
did you hear our topic 
di- yes 
all right 
basketball 
um-hum 
i guess i 'm probably a lot like you 
i 'm a dallas maverick fan 
well i certainly am too 
now tell me what you expect from the mavericks this year 
well unf- -fortunately i do n't expect a great deal out of them 
they just have too many problems too many ailments too many hurt bones and maybe too much age at this point 
you know when roy tarpley just now he messed up on them it just hurt them so bad 
i feel like everyone else 
um 
i feel sorry for donald carter and the owners of the team and the management of team and everyone else 
it just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possi- be a a final a final team playing for for all of it 
y- yes sir 
national championship or the world championship and something like this happens 
ah 
well do you think it 's time that we go for new uh coaches 
is that part of our problem 
yeah 
i think at this time we 're just in a a rebuilding type of phase you know 
i think that probably would be evident with the more and more the more and more young guys they draft 
well it just i- i- it 's so discouraging that they can n't really 
i mean they 're entitled to more than they 've been able to do so far 
i i 'm awfully sorry that the mavericks can n't come on and and do 
roy who 's your next best team 
or who do you like after the mavericks 
oh gosh 
i 'm so much of a maverick maverick fan i do n't know 
probably the boston celtics 
i 've just always liked the boston celtics 
they have a they have a similar situation now that a lot of uh old guys on the team 
and but they 're still playing good ball 
well 
but i 'm a i 've always been a boston celtic fan too 
but you know i 've lived in texas since seventy four 
so being a transplanted texan in in the dallas area i have to stick with those dallas mavericks 
we certainly need to support them do we not 
yes 
we do you know 
do you go to the game 
yes 
i go to a few games 
i have n't been to many 
i 'm not a season ticket holder or anything 
i was a season ticket holder of the cowboys for years 
and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school college and doing their own thing sort of gets boring going by yourself 
well yes 
it does 
i 'm sure it would it 's such a monstrous place down there 
oh you bet 
but um maybe next maybe they can do some 
i do n't know 
who do they need to trade 
well i do n't know 
it seems like rolando blackman and and harper sort of carry the team 
they just 
i do n't know 
if i 'm afraid to say that 's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good 
but and that can really help the team 
but they do that they trade the nucleus of their power right now 
yes sir 
it seems that way to me 
i course i do n't know any of the newer ones that they have 
and i 'm not well of versed on their capabilities 
but we really need to do something 
well you know i feel like uh the best they can hope for this year is probably ah an opportunity to make the play-offs 
i like their coach 
i really like richie a lot 
and i just i think he deserves a good break 
he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club 
and i think donald carter the owner i think with all he 's invested he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also 
i really 
yes sir 
this thing with roy tarpley it just upset everyone i think 
fans owners management everyone 
and they have just done as much as they can for that man 
and he apparently can n't straighten his act out 
so we need to to build on something more positive than that 
you bet 
i think they 're fools if they ever bring him back 
oh i do too 
i certainly would agree to that 
hate to put it that way 
i just would not believe him anymore 
well it um 
i mean you can n't give anyone too many chances and i think he has gone over the limit 
no 
there 's an old saying you can l- you can lead a horse to water 
but you can n't make him drink 
so 
that 's right 
and i think tarpley 's just a sad case 
well 
but to be making ah a million dollars a year that 's pretty sad 
it is tragic 
i do n't um 
i mean we 're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they 're paying to all of our athletes i think 
oh i think you 're right 
everything just been put out of perspective now 
you know you take a a young kid roy tarpley 's age i 'd say he was twenty one when he came into the league 
an- and now he 's probably an old age of uh twenty five or six and making all that money 
uh it yes sir 
well that 's uh that 's quite a that 's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they they need at that point in their life i think 
i think you 're right 
i believe that one 
so 
so so i think you know it 's created by 
you 've done 
our most recent uh in series of projects i guess was inside was uh we remodeled the bathroom recently 
and how did it go 
well it went pretty well um other than the fact that we encountered some uh problems that you run across in older homes with uh plumbing which one thing led to another 
and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain which meant you need take the wall out and start all over 
jeez it 's like starting over i guess 
oh 
it was n't one of those 
it started out as a sunday project and by the by the next sunday it was done 
uh-huh 
it was n't a one-dayer 
believe me 
and it boy that sounds like uh 
course uh i do n't know 
once you get it done then you probably wo n't have that problem again 
yeah 
it 's good for another thirty years 
um i- you 've got an older house 
yes 
they uh built a little bit more sturdy than 
well that 's the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing everything in there was copper 
right 
and it was all soldered 
oh is that right 
that 's what drove me bananas because you know i 'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and and cement to fit them together 
yes 
and nothing wanted to go 
so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over 
and it 's all been so and just start at square one 
really 
huh 
that was an all day job just to get it plumbed 
well and then if you do it wrong 
fortunately i was very fortunate uh in the fact that uh when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked 
everything went all right 
everything worked 
and i just said that 's marvelous 
i appreciate it 
that 's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happen 
well i expected something to leak you know left a fitting loose or did n't use teflon tape on one or something like that 
right 
yeah 
right 
but it all came together 
so i i felt pretty fortunate about that 
all worked out all right huh 
how about you 
well um ah probably the last thing i did was uh paint and wallpaper kids room and uh i learned uh 
um-hum 
i used the wrong kind of paint 
this was n't must have not been a very good quality because it just has n't stood up very well 
what kind of paint 
it was a latex paint paint 
it was flat and i wonder if maybe i should 've used the gloss 
um-hum 
uh but they say you uh use your gloss mainly in your kitchens and things like that 
yeah 
that and semigloss for trim work and usually flat for walls 
yeah 
but i think maybe uh 
i do n't know if it was just the 
was it not washable paint 
well it it is a latex paint 
but it just kind of is 
so you know so it 's supposed to wash you 're supposed to be able to wash it but it um just looks dingy 
um-hum 
i do n't know how else to explain it 
what color is it 
just it 's pink 
pink 
okay 
it 's kind of got uh oh just kind of a worn look to it 
i do n't eve- even know how to say 
just did n't turn out quite as nice as i would have liked 
but 
did you uh require more than one can of paint 
we put two coats on it 
and it 's a small room 
but i think it only took one uh can 
um-hum you did n't have to mix paint then right 
no 
okay 
we did uh oh 
you do mix the color as far as you start with uh white 
and then they add the color 
um-hum 
yeah 
you know what i 'm saying 
but 
yeah 
but you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with 
yes 
right 
and then i wallpapered a couple of walls 
and uh 
how 'd that go 
well that was the first time i 've ever wallpapered 
and uh 
kind of fun is n't it 
that 's a an education in itself 
really 
but uh the dye lots uh must have been a little bit different from 
first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if you 're trying to match a design 
repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you when you buy your paper 
and i yes 
that 's what i needed 
and i did n't think about that 
i got a mickey mouse print is what i got 
yeah 
and so a lot is wasted 
normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats 
so you 'd know how 
i see i did n't even think to look for that 
yeah 
and then the 
one of them was just a different color different color pink is what it ended up being 
hm 
and 
when you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall 
i no 
i did n't 
or did you start at the edge 
is that how you 're supposed to do 
i started at one edge and went over 
then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window but uh 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i 've had my best luck in papering when i start in the middle of a wall 
and i 'll start with a plumb line and start in the middle of the wall and and go from there and go all the way around the room 
and start right there 
it seem to get it straighter 
is that the advantage 
or what 's the 
well you you 
okay scott 
let 's uh talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university and 
uh-huh 
do you have any 
do you have any kids 
or 
i have some yes some children 
i have three boys 
uh-huh 
and they 're all quite young and so we want to plan for their education 
um-hum 
w- we 're saving right now 
and we 're getting bonds and and uh and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to 
how about yourself 
do you have any kids 
right no 
i 'm in gr- i 'm in graduate school right now 
so so i imagine you 've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college 
yeah 
yeah 
definitely 
in fact i 'm even going uh selecting again for for my phd 
it 's it 's a closed subject right now 
very good 
um 
what uh what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to 
well i use uh uh uh i have used uh several techniques depending on what 
for undergraduate i i you know my my criteria were much different than than like for graduate school 
um-hum 
um when i when i wanted to go to an undergraduate 's institution i was looking for something that was you know rather small and easy to get around you know and what i would what i thought would be easy to get through 
um-hum 
yeah 
wh- what you thought huh 
yeah 
and and uh yeah my choice of graduate schools was uh you know it changed a whole lot 
i i got to where i i wanted to uh uh graduate with a little you know with a name behind me rather than uh yeah 
just the degree itself 
yeah 
well that 's a that 's that 's good 
because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work 
so um-hum 
i wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you did n't have a lecture w- uh hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor 's attention and uh but you i felt that i got a a pretty good uh undergraduate um 
um-hum 
yeah 
wh- where did you go 
i went to utah state university which is in logan utah and the nice thing about it too is i knew that i wanted to get into business and that their business college of business was accredited and well known at least there in the state of utah and around the surrounding states and so forth 
okay 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and so i i felt like number one you nee- you also need to to see what kind of name the like you mentioned before the name the college and university can can give you and another thing that uh another reason why i chose that was the the finances 
yeah 
i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it that i would n't get through four three years of of the undergraduate work and and have to leave 
uh-huh 
and uh so i did a lot of talking with friends with family with uh counselors at high school and also read some some books on on the subject at the at the library 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and uh it was kind of unusual because my my two older brothers and i all went to thr- three different universities depending upon what our choice was 
so 
right 
hopefully we we chose the one that was best for us 
and i i felt very comfortable and good about that 
so 
um-hum 
do you do you worry do you worry any about uh uh y- being able 
i mean do you uh obviously you 've taken precautions you know or or measures to uh try and pay for your children 's education 
but do you think that that 's going to be enough 
i i do n't think so 
no 
i do n't know 
the the way that tuition is increasing um exponentially it 's it 's it 's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow same pace that the college tuition is increasing 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i uh 
i all i all i can hope for is that i land a professorship at a at a nice heavy university 
and that the your children can use the benefits of that university 
and yeah 
well that that 's an excellent idea 
that 's an excellent idea 
one thing that uh that we did uh and my parents and our family is that we were n't able to afford um the kind of education that we all desired 
so my parents stressed that we get excellent grades and that we apply and try for scholarships and uh scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education because my parents could n't 
and what these scholarship could not supply i was able to to work for and and save and and and get 
yeah 
um-hum 
also my my brother um he 's a he 's a medical doctor right now 
he had to you know 
once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans 
and he 's he 's working to pay those off 
um-hum yeah 
so i i think that the uh you know once you get past uh the initial stages of it that there 's different options you can use 
and and uh the student loans are are a good option 
um-hum um-hum yeah 
yeah 
that 's what that 's my biggest option right now 
and yeah 
yes 
and and as you 're well aware that tuition 's not ch- 
what what 
how do you get your main source of current events 
well un- until recently i was taking the wall street journal 
and i thought that was a good way 
but i have about five different magazines that i get that keeps me up on things 
you know it 's a week or two late 
but uh that 's how i 'm staying up 
i either watch the news 
or i or o- occasionally i 'll read the paper 
uh do you like how it 's presented on the news 
um no 
i think the media 's a little bit too manipulative 
they allow you uh 
uh they they try to lead you too much i believe 
and and sometimes they 're not very open 
i- i do n't know 
i think they 're a little bit biased sometimes 
like for example the kennedy uh the kennedy rape case 
the the coverage on that was you know 
when it first happened it was he was guilty he was guilty he was guilty 
and y- y- you know they they they try to have you form opinions or whatever 
a- and then i d- i did n't like the thi- uh the things that were going on when we had desert storm and stuff like that 
you know basically i- i- i think they do n't present the the whole sides of of everything 
it it so it it makes you feel like they 're uh wanting you to take their opinion 
right 
uh it 's it it 's uh it- instead of reporting the news uh it 's more like an editorial i believe on a lot of issues 
yeah 
i 've noticed that too 
and it 's kind of distressing is n't it 
yeah 
and they just i 've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words uh usually uh just that sway the whole uh report that you know by just a couple of words 
well when i when i was in school i um i was a communications major 
so i- i- i- i- i 'm i 'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking and and so forth 
so communications huh 
were you looking into becoming a reporter 
or 
i was 
and u- um i we- i ventured off in a whole entire different fiel- field 
um i work with the state 
uh-huh 
and uh i um work with the department of state treasury in retirement disability 
uh calculate benefits 
i bet that 's a interesting job 
yeah 
so the 
a- so i and you know work is you know working for state government you you hear all about current events a- about things going on within the state itself 
so that that 's another source that i- i- i- i where i keep up with current events 
and 
yeah 
there 's one that i 'm reading right now 
it 's information week 
it says at&t to account for the the benefits that the aicpa now says you have to show as a liability 
it 's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety three to account for that 
it 's a lot of money 
and it 'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more 
it 's a lot of money 
yeah 
it is 
and yeah you have to stay up on stuff 
and i bet in your your job that you have to 
do you read the wall street journal 
no 
well no 
i- i- i- i i primarily deal with the state employees 
but i- i find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the like the state of uh uh north carolina 's budget and stuff like that 
and i- i really know what the budget is 
and a- and uh uh when they were saying we were so poor and they could n't pay taxes and to pay people their income tax refunds and stuff like that 
and you know i 'm well aware of the billions of assets the that the state has 
and i- i- i- it 's just funny 
y- you know so that- that- that- that 's 
so i do n't have a whole lot of faith in in you know the news 
of course it 's 
they they get what they hear from 
but you know it 's not always i- i think one hundred percent reliable 
do you c- can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective 
i think they need to do a little bit uh go into a little bit more depth uh a- before they would just report like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that 
because i mean another example is the uh aids issue or whatever 
tha- you know someone said oh i found a cure 
they immediately 
the headlines on the news or whatever is so and so has found a cure for aids 
and then two months later it 's discovered it 's not you know 
it 's uh before they before they come out with something like that they need to to research the th- the matter i believe a little bit more 
i guess they do that so they do n't get scooped you know 
so they have the big story 
well that 
tha- well yeah 
i- i th- i 
it 
i think the the 
-kay howard 
what do you think of our space budget 
and should we go ahead and and keep exploring 
or should we call a halt to it 
is it doing any good 
i think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country 
now i think what we made a major wrong turn we went into the uh to the current generation of space craft the reusable ones like they are now because they have not proven as reliable as they should have 
um-hum 
and i think some of the earlier approaches were much more um much better in many ways 
however um you know we 've gained an awful lot from the space program all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to uh some new space age materials plastics and all that 
so i think it 's been a good investment 
uh somebody was telling me the return was about twenty five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent which is amazing for any governmental financed program 
oh really 
oh yes 
wish our post office could do that 
i wish the post office just stop raising our rates 
that 's right 
i wish they 'd just deliver stuff 
um i think though that now that we 're finally starting to get over the fears and the uh oh i do n't know the guilt that we had out of uh challenger 
i think maybe we can pick up and go on now 
um-hum 
but i i do n't know 
i do n't think we 're really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives 
i agree 
the space station is where we should go at this point 
i agree 
seems like that we 've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor 
and you know and i 'm in favor of you know getting closer to seeing certain things 
but i 'd like to see them also go you know go back up there see you know what they can do see about setting a a space station up 
i 'm all in favor of the space program 
and i do n't think we should stop 
and i do n't think we should cut the money 
well where do you think we ought to go with it 
um 
you talking about uh uh a a fully manned space station that we 'll keep up there 
yeah 
i would li- i 'd like to see that 
i 'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there an- and see what 's going on even if you know there 's no life up there or anything you know 
but who knows 
and i would like to see them do something like that 
well 
i i hate to see them just you know keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things 
and i think they i think they lose sight of of part of what they 're supposed to be doing 
you well i think about half the missions now are are military related are they not 
yes 
yes 
and uh it seems like it 's that high a percentage 
i believe they are 
you know let 's go back to our original thing with you know the right experiments and our uh you know our actual exploring of space and and all that 
and you know with with russia uh seemingly not going to be a- as big a threat 
well they can n't afford to 
huh-uh you know 
and have you gone out to uh fort worth to see the space soviet space exhibit 
no 
we were talking about that this weekend 
we it 's only going to be there a couple more weeks 
um-hum 
um-hum 
we need to go 
we went uh 
we took our grandsons and went uh the weekend before last 
and it is marvelous 
i mean it 's really neat how they they have done it 
they have done a beautiful job 
have they 
and they have a uh scaled down model showing how they you know fuel it or you know how they uh oh the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they uh 
all those things that are against the actual space mission uh space ship you know how they fall away from it 
and the loading and then and then it 's actually you know 
oh yes 
the smoke comes out like it 's taking off 
it is really interesting 
well maybe i need to run out there this weekend 
you really do 
it it 's well worth the time and effort 
we went uh early on sunday 
we got out there about uh ten ten thirty 
and beat 
now do you have to have tickets ahead 
excuse me 
no 
we bought tickets there 
and if you have children if you go to mcdonald 's you could they have coupons or did have 
now they may be through with them now 
that uh buy one adult 
and one child gets in free 
um i think both of both of my kids are too old for that they 're both uh 
oh okay 
oh okay 
you have teenagers or something 
yes 
yes 
yes 
well i had grandchildren so three of them so between their mother and their grandfather and i 
because their dad was at work 
and uh but and the boys loved it you know 
but you 
they really did like it 
it 's it 's very impressive i 'm sure 
uh-huh 
it is 
and i felt the uh six year old would you know that he 'd be kind of bored 
but he was n't 
even the three year old enjoyed it because they had one of th- had one of those moon vehicles and had it set up like it was on the moon an- and showed it moving around and stuff 
what um-hum 
so it was really neat 
well see now that 's something else 
the uh russians have had space stations manned stat- space stations for years now 
you you know they had the mir and see we 've yet to keep anyone up over over a week or ten days 
um-hum 
um-hum 
right 
well in going through it i got the impression that actually they were farther ahead 
okay 
well 
there we are 
all right um um well uh 
tell me about the car that you 've got 
well i have a honda um hatchback nineteen eighty four 
a- uh-huh 
and i had a hatchback a nineteen seventy eight version before this one 
uh-huh 
and uh i 'll be honest with you 
i have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and and uh put together 
and it it does its job 
all i have to do on my honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty five hundred miles 
and i i did have to put two f- two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles 
but that car just purrs like the day it was built 
i get forty two miles per gallon on the highway and right between twenty eight to thirty driving around in town 
it 's a uh five speed straight stick machine 
um-hum 
and i can carry more in that uh that trunk area in my little honda than i can in the big cars 
and i have a large um pontiac 
and i have a sixty nine cougar which really is i 'm saving because it 's it 's old 
but it 's in beautiful shape 
um-hum 
but i can carry as much in my honda or more than i can in in those other bigger cars 
well that 's very interesting 
i 've had i 've had exactly the same experience with the one that i 've got 
it 's a 
and surprisingly it 's also an eighty four and um 
oh 
lx 
yeah 
i 'm still there 
um i 'm sorry what 
it was an lx 
yes 
it 's an lx 
it 's not a hatchback 
but it 's um it 's uh 
uh-huh 
yours is a four door 
four door 
yeah and very very comfortable car 
um-hum 
big roomy trunk uh and uh and very happy with it 
yeah 
and i must admit it 's you know 
if if if uh 
yeah my only consideration were were you know buying another car just to tool around town and and make you know brief trips and things like that 
i i would very very seriously consider buying one uh 
i think they 're extraordinarily reliable cars 
yes 
we are 
um my my real concern with with uh uh why i 'm not sure i- i want to buy a honda is because i have to make a kind of a a steady um trip down the road about once a month because i 'm divorced 
and i have a daughter that lives down in north carolina and uh i i drive down interstate ninety five 
well hm 
and it 's just an absolutely wild highway 
ninety five is wild in any car 
there 's no doubt about that because i- i- i run over to crystal city or used to 
yeah 
and 
i 'm retiring the end of this month but i 'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there 
uh-huh 
and y- well you 've got it 
and uh so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine it 's very hard for me to imagine that that uh a honda 's going to be as safe a car as as the one that i 've got got my eye on which is a volvo 
um-hum 
um-hum 
in in fact quite frankly i 've owned a volvo in the past 
and uh i 've i 've 
um-hum 
they 're expensive cars to keep up when they need service 
but uh i 've found that i 've had a lot of luck with them 
uh course i 'm a mechanically inclined kind of person 
and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that you know need to be taken care of and so forth 
and i guess that 's one thing that that recommends the honda to a lot of people is is there 's just very little that you have to do under the hood 
and 
yes 
it jus- just sits there and purrs 
and you all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter 
i get six hundred miles on a tank of gas 
oh i know 
it 's really amazing 
yeah 
it 's 
beautiful beautiful machine 
absolutely 
incredible 
so um yeah 
anyway i 've been looking at the prices of these cars and a- and so forth 
and i think that it 's it 's very surprising some of these very expensive volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you 're willing to buy ones that are about the vintage of the the cars that you and i currently own and um 
is that right 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
well a brand new volvo costs what thirty thousand dollars 
well certainly some of the top end ones 
you can still get get uh even the the low end wagons um for less than twenty thousand dollars and uh we get you know 
uh-huh 
in the washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of volvo dealerships down here so there 're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any any week 
um um-hum 
and i sort of you know scan the paper and look at them and so forth 
and so um anyway and that 's that 's the other thing is that i 've i 've never really been too terribly much of a new car person 
yeah 
i think i 've bought one or two new cars in my life 
and i 've tended to um to uh buy cars that are you know two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old 
this honda that i have i bought used 
and in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it 
i 've just rolled seventy thousand miles 
and it 's a seventy four i mean an eighty four 
so 
well my my eigh- eighty four just has seventy seven on it and i 've made many trips to washington and down to virginia beach virginia where my mother lives and things like that 
yeah 
and i drive it 
being up up there maybe maybe you guys do n't have as uh big a problem with air pollution as many do you 
w- we we have a terrible air pollution problem 
do you really 
our summers are extremely uh hazardous and during ah certain wind directions because we get the uh gary indiana chicago pollution and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze uh coming up along the lake 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
that 's horrible 
um-hum 
and they do post uh uh warnings for people who have uh heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season 
um-hum 
in the winter it 's not as severe 
right 
but uh if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad 
uh-huh 
uh the state of wisconsin as a matter of fact uh started some litigation against illinois because of the air pollution we were getting 
uh-huh 
ah i do n't think it 's going to go very far 
but it it was uh a way of ah triggering uh awareness 
right 
right 
so what 's the conditions like in dallas 
well uh in dallas i- i have n't seen air pollution quite on a quite on a level that we had in denver 
uh i grew up in denver 
and and i 've lived there most of my life 
and we used to have those uh you know the posted warning days 
uh however in colorado now they have the emissions control law which has really cut down 
probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to po- post warnings now you know as far as health concerns 
um 
uh due to that emiss- th- the emissions uh uh control on the vehicles seems that all of our all of our ah smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry 
wisconsin has a a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they 're tested for uh their pollution control equipment 
um-hum 
and if they do n't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it 's it is drivable 
hm 
so they 've they 've tried to do a lot of that and i 
um-hum 
you know uh there seem to be a- at least in certain little pockets 
and we were talking earlier about madison madison has one of the nicest uh bike uh road uh sharing programs of of any city in wisconsin in all of wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of uh bike trails for recreational use of any of the states 
um-hum 
oh really 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and there is a a real promotion of of biking but um there are still a lot of people who 'll insist on on driving their own automobiles uh to go everywhere 
uh-huh 
right 
i find that a little irritating because i do n't think it 's always so necessary 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
it it becomes it uh 
maybe to you and i who have grown up in some in s- uh uh some more uh beautiful parts of the country uh i think that that uh we become a little more aware uh rather quickly of of what 's happening with air pollution and how uh how horrible it really is 
um i i notice people in in dallas seem to say well sure there 's air pollution but you know really how bad i- how pro- how bad could this problem really be 
send send them to wisconsin 
and we 'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from uh the uh acid rain and they 'll they 'll they may wake up you know 
um oh really 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
how would you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of the acid rain 
um you right 
right 
it 's a really a serious issue for those of us up in this ah sector up up here 
do you find that um or or do you hypothesize that that most of the uh smog or or air pollution comes from vehicles 
or does it come mostly from industry up there 
i think it 's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of of the gary area and uh i do n't know exactly where it emerges from when it it 's up in the ah northern sectors of wisconsin that causes the acid rain 
oh yeah 
um-hum 
um-hum 
that i 'm a little uncertain of 
but i do know that uh it is a problem 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i had talked with my parents 
i i grew up uh i was born in uh muncie indiana and and grew up a little bit in terre haute 
and i had asked them before uh 
i went back to visit recently about a year ago 
and i asked them 
i said did you ever realize the air pollution that was 
well let 's see 
my husband does the majority of the um the uh gardening um taking care of the lawn and fertilizing 
but i um tend to all the planting the annuals and and the spraying and um taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in you know throughout that season and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and um any kind of decorating for the holidays you know 
i 'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for halloween and christmas 
but basically he does all the heavy stuff 
and i do all the fun stuff 
well we have it just opposite here 
my wife works in you know at at at the ti 
and she 's uh sedentary all day long so when she gets home she likes to mow 
uh-huh 
i say 
and we have about ten acres 
and she tries to mow about half of it 
wow 
wow that 's a a big job 
well yeah 
it keeps uh well 
it 's doing real well 
because when we got this place the the dirt was just overgrazed i mean you know it was bare dirt in a lot of places and now you know since we 've been mowing it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and you know of course we water a little bit 
but that 's just too much to water all at once 
but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we 've reclaimed a lot of it 
oh sure 
oh i bet it 's beautiful 
yeah 
but we do n't do much in the way of uh flowers 
we have one little flower garden that we that we work with 
um-hum 
the rest of it is just like wild flowers and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers 
wild flowers 
uh-huh 
they 're about oh i guess a third the size of your palm of your hand and of course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and indian paintbrush 
um-hum 
oh that sounds lovely 
uh-huh 
oh the wild flowers are beautiful 
i think um i was thinking about throwing some for in the back just where the kids um just way in the back behind the swing sets 
so that just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty 
then you do n't really have to have much maintenance involved 
yeah 
well my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing 
um-hum 
uh she enjoys mowing 
i can n't believe it 
uh-huh 
i know a lot of uh-huh 
i mean i hate it 
a lot of women do uh um 
i 've just never really you know 
maybe one of these days i 'll have to get out there and mow 
but um my husband takes that 
and i 'll help rake up the grass 
and um sometimes i 'll help him edge um 
because we do n't have that much property 
but we 're on a corner lot 
so there 's a lot of edging to do and um uh that 's what 's nice about living more in the country 
right 
you do n't have to worry about any of that 
yeah we do n't even have any concrete or asphalt 
oh 
oh that 's nice 
i 
this is different for us because the other 
the past we 've had homes that have n't had any side walks 
and um it 's been a little more country with the trees 
and we do miss that 
um if we had a chance to move i think we 'd move back to somewhere that it was little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as as far as that goes 
yeah but you know we do everything together 
um-hum 
this this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the 
actually this fall what am i talking about 
two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the you know soil and conservation people and uh we 're in the process of of planting and we 're building a stand uh just to the north of our house and along the east uh property line and i uh i think what we 're what we 're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because i 'll tell you in winter time when that w- when that wind comes out of the north it just cuts right through you like you 're not even there 
wow 
uh-huh 
wow that 's 
a um 
um-hum 
right 
so 
right 
well i took 
on the other side of the house though that 's where we have all the the delicate flowers and the mums 
and we have morning glory and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers 
um-hum 
and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of water and we get hummingbirds come in the spring you know all summer long 
uh-huh 
oh 
oh that sounds so pretty 
and well when we leave the doors open they fly in the house 
oh really 
do they do n't do any damage though 
they just fly right back out if you have the 
well yeah 
they do n't like it in here because there 's nothing to eat and when you 're as busy as one of those babies you got to eat most of the time 
i say 
i say 
and we 've got a few you know 
we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders 
um-hum 
but you know for the most part gardening for us is 
well we got asparagus 
and uh we 've got some plum trees and some apple trees some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries 
uh-huh 
man we get the best strawberries that you just can n't believe 
oh oh that sounds wonderful 
yeah we just got our last tomatoes 
oh i love home gr- grown tomatoes 
yeah 
there 's nothing like them 
they just do n't have the same ones in the supermarket 
well these are accidental tomatoes 
what does that mean accidental tomatoes 
well last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes 
course you 're going to lose some that way and the seeds go right through them 
uh-huh 
i say 
and wherever they pooped 
uh well uh to begin 
i guess uh space is uh real important i think 
so it 's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time i guess 
so 
yeah 
i- i- i- i agree it 's it 's definitely new frontier stuff 
uh 
so uh 
but uh i 'm not too up to date on the space on the space frontier 
but uh but i guess they 're going going pretty far into it now 
um star wars is not too far i do n't think 
but uh 
yeah i- i worked on some of it at ti once upon a time 
oh have you 
yeah 
so what do you know about it 
well actually i 'm i i 'm quite versed lately 
i get on a computer network all the time 
and people are talking about about the current space program all the time 
they 're talking about new rockets that they 're designing now that you know are just like science fiction you know 
it 's like they take off you know 
and then they land with the with the you know 
the afterburners are going you know not like space shuttle landing you know gliding down but straight down to the landing pad 
really 
oh my gosh 
yeah 
it 's called vcx or something like that 
also called delta clipper which is a decent name for something like that 
well 
well i do n't know 
you think you 'd you think you 'd uh go up in space you had a chance 
oh yeah i think i would 
would you 
i think that 'd be neat 
i think i would ju- just sitting here ta- talking about it 
if the time came it 'd be real nervous 
i 'd be scared 
i think that 'd be worse than six flags roller coaster 
that 'd be pretty hairy 
yeah well you know i had a car uh uh a tire come off of a car 
so you know that 's like i know what it 's like to 
yeah 
imagine 
de- depending on what was left of my technology to get me home 
right 
right 
so uh well i guess they 're talking about people going to the moon and stuff now or where ever and opening up those stations or what ever filling them 
yeah 
they 're talking about doing that again too 
um-hum 
i do n't know if we 'll ever see that but 
well least uh have a space station supposedly in the next few years 
oh really 
yeah 
and they 're going to put 
that 's all beyond my imagination really 
yeah 
but science fiction books 
i mean you look at the jetsons you know a cartoon show and it 's not too far fetched what what they all had in those cartoons 
so you never know 
oh yeah 
yeah 
and they had stuff on the jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would come become possible and now you we have lot of those 
so 
um-hum 
so you never know what what may occur 
but as far as me seeing it no i do n't know 
yeah 
i do n't know 
but i think it 's real vital important for the future you know generations to come 
um-hum 
so 
yeah 
i i 
it 's it 's it 's something definitely that uh yeah 
it 's it 's uh got the extra little oomph of interest 
yeah 
yeah 
i 'm sure it 'll draw a lot more interest too once it becomes you know like it 's more possible 
that when they start showing the drawings and all that i 'm sure you know when they 
yeah 
yeah 
i wish uh 
like uh boeing or or uh mcdonald douglas or something like that was supposed to buy a a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it you know purely commercial i 'd go up you know and do things 
right 
uh-huh 
and 
so did they scratch those uh that star wars deal you know the one we was all worried about russia and all that 
you know oh 
no 
it 's still probably going 
but i do n't know whether it it research will go on 
yeah 
but the economy the way it is all over them they probably cut back on on that because it 's not 
oh yeah 
well they 're they 're going to be cutting back so much on just you know the number of troops we 've got in europe and the number of troops we have here 
right 
yeah 
i know 
and then 
but uh russia 's still going to have missiles 
they 're still going to be subs and things 
yeah 
and we do n't know who 's ha- handling them now so that 's a whole different story now 
yeah 
latest i heard it was just going to be russia that russia itself that was going to have them 
oh really 
at least that was you know that 's what everybody says 
oh yeah 
yeah 
we want only russia to have them 
uh-huh 
and now they say yeah 
yeah 
you 're republic 
you do n't want those 
you do n't want those 
some crazy hitler over there from one of those little republic- republics or whatever 
they 're splitting it all up now 
and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of 
give them to mother russia um-hum 
you never know 
but that the guy that 's taken over for gorbachev he 's supposed to be uh he 's supposed to be on our side is n't he 
or pretty much 
one hopes 
yeah 
i think we went through him though to get to gorbachev on a lot of subjects 
so 
um-hum 
but that way you can n't never tell that 
yeah 
you know you know kiss some butt 
but but uh 
well tell me about your home 
okay 
uh right now we 're living in 
uh well it 's me uh my wife and uh two young boys 
and uh right now we 're in a uh i guess it 's either a zero lot line or a garden home which you might call it 
uh-huh 
so we do n't have a a big yard uh 
but uh when my wife and i first moved in it was just the two of us 
so it was enough 
um-hum 
uh and it 's uh i guess what they call a story and a half 
because it 's not a full two story where you know everything on top is on bottom 
yeah 
so it 's got real high ceilings on half the house 
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings 
hm 
and uh i- it 's about a five year old house now 
it sounds nice 
it 's uh pretty nice 
u- unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already 
oh yeah 
yeah 
it was a 
landmark is the one who built it 
yeah 
well you know these guys that gambled high lost big you know 
yeah 
that 's true 
and uh i 'm insulating myself from that problem 
exactly what happened to them 
i 'm building my own house 
oh that 's nice 
and as i look out the window of my trailer i can envision all the insulation that 's going up today 
oh really 
yeah 
are you doing it yourself 
yeah 
wow 
i- i used to be a builder 
oh that 's nice 
and i retired about five years ago and started college 
oh i see 
oh 
and now i 'm uh a college educated builder 
there 's still no work you know 
yeah 
so uh you know i decided this summer that uh you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials 
so i did 
that 's great 
and uh see the the state has a law that says you can not borrow the money to build your own home 
re- 
is that so 
i did n't know that 
you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house 
but you can n't borrow the money to build your own 
that sounds kind of dumb 
well it 's to protect the the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home and then it does n't sell 
hm 
and then the bank 's holding the bag 
yeah 
yeah 
well 
hm 
as as you know anything that involves the government is works half as well as it 's supposed to costs three times as much right 
that 's right 
hence the savings and loan problem we have 
yeah 
that 's true 
today but uh you know my home is uh fairly simple 
it 's designed to be added on to 
um-hum 
that 's good 
yeah 
well i figure it 's just me and my wife 
but you know i like to do stuff with my hands and what not 
so i 'm going to have a shop 
yeah 
y- how big a lot do you got it on 
ten acres 
wow 
that 's nice 
that 's real nice 
well yes 
it 's really nice too because i can n't see my nearest neighbor 
he 's on the other side of a hill 
oh 
and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon 
seriously 
go- 
that 's pretty good 
and well in s- in the winter time i can see see another guy 
but you know he 's you know i can just make out his place you know i got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten mile to the north 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh 
oh that 's pretty good 
yeah 
well i took a lot of time in choosing this site because the the house has no heating or air conditioning 
uh uh-huh 
oh you you you do n't plan on putting any any of that in 
well it 's got a a very small furnace 
uh-huh 
and a uh i 'm use a wood burning stove as well 
yeah 
but in the house itself i 've been working inside you know these low these many months and i have not had to use the heat 
um-hum 
wow 
because it 's all geothermal 
yeah 
that 's pretty good 
and with all the 
see i 've got 
on the south side is all glass 
well as much as i could get in it you know and uh the east side is glass 
yeah 
i 've got uh one two three four five six windows in the east side on forty eight feet 
so it 's almost all glass 
wow 
and uh 
my wife would love that 
oh yeah 
i mean you know there 's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows 
she loves lots of windows 
that 's great 
so uh 
is it a single story 
well not really 
it 's uh it 's on the side of a hill 
oh i see 
so the first you know 
the the the 
what i call residential level at the side that 's in the hill is about four feet deep 
um-hum 
um i see 
and the side that 's on the uh the other side is about six feet high 
oh 
so i got a pretty good grade there 
yeah 
and then when i put the verandas whi- which will be twelve feet out a- all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop 
um-hum 
yeah 
that 's kind of like uh like a victorian style 
so exactly 
yeah 
i i 've always liked that 
the 
you know i we do n't have much yard 
but i built a small deck in the back 
yeah um-hum 
but you know i- i see these magazines where you know do your s- your own decks 
um-hum yeah 
i- i kind of wish i had them the size property and and uh one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck when 
i 'm sorry um hobbies 
that 's okay 
i did n't hear 
okay 
let me see 
i do n't know if that took or not 
i 'll do it again 
okay 
okay 
what are your hobbies 
i hear you have kids right 
you you heard her in the background 
that 's babies 
that 's your full time uh hobby right 
takes a lot of time huh 
i like uh most sports 
i like to do that 
i kind of like to do a little bit of sewing 
um-hum 
oh little bit of embroidery work once in a while 
um-hum 
what do you like to do 
um i try to do some painting although i 'm not very good at it 
well i 'm sure you probably are 
um i well no 
not really 
you like it 
that 's the main 
yeah 
i i have you know i inherited the genes that make me think i 'm creative but not the ones that give me the ability to be 
point right that 's right 
so i always try 
i i do some sewing mostly out of necessity 
um i 'm making drapes for my house just because i 'm 
oh boy that 's hard sewin- 
yeah 
well it is n't and it is 
it is you know 
actually the sewing is n't the hard part 
it 's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room 
measure it and get it uh 
well if it it depends on how elaborate you get it 
if you get pleats and all kinds of 
yeah 
i 've been doing that 
and that 
things that 's a lot of work 
yeah 
that 
but usually i have to do the pleats by hand 
so that at least i can do i- you know watching tv or whatever 
oh 
but 
right 
right 
yeah 
and i 've i 've gone and you know put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through 
but 
that feels really good 
yeah 
so that 's not really my favorite thing to do or anything but i i need to do it 
you do it 
right 
i have let 's see i have a dog and a lot of fish 
keeping fish i guess is my biggest hobby 
keeping fish 
well they 're probably easier than keeping dogs though are n't they 
and um yes and no 
it depends on and how frequently they die and how much that bothers you 
oh no 
how much that bothers you 
and you probably have to clean out the tank uh 
that 's 
you do n't do as much as as i thought 
in fact my problem 
i had fish as a kid 
and they always died i mean immediately 
oh no 
and what i 'm what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean because you have 
oh you 're kidding because they need to have a little bit of the 
right 
you need to let the bacteria build up 
and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance 
i say 
and i would just take everything out and just like you know wash it with scalding hot water and and it would kill all the bacteria 
oh no 
and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again so 
and so you 'd have to start all over to build that up probably 
right 
that 's right 
so now all i i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing and i do n't try and sterilize things 
right 
right 
do n't go through the whole nine yards 
and they kind of need a little bit of that 
that 's right 
that 's right 
so you 've had fish for a long time 
well i 've had them 
i guess it 's been two years now i 've had a a tank here 
and and then back at home i used to have a small you know five gallon tank 
but that never worked well 
and i have fifty five gallons now 
what size do you have there 
oh that 's good size 
it 's a lot easier 
have you ever had it to crack or break or leak 
no 
no 
not yet 
i was just playing you fifty five gallons you 'd hope it would never do that 
that 's right 
i really do 
but you know 
what do you have all kinds of different fish 
or 
yeah 
i just have you know what they call community fish you know guppies and platies and and basic things 
um-hum 
i do n't get into the ex- right 
real exotic 
right 
the expensive ones 
huh well they 're probably harder to harder to take care of 
and 
they are 
and they 're very expensive 
and you know when you die it 's like it when when they die it 's more like an investment 
yes 
i bet it is 
you 've lost an investment 
so 
do you have problems with them uh your fish eating each other 
no 
not really 
only if there 's baby fish 
right 
you always have to isolate those 
then you have to 
how do you isolate them 
you get um well no 
a jars something 
or 
they have uh breeders 
okay 
it 's a little plastic thing that sort of floats and you put the mother fish in there 
okay 
and then it 's got like a trough underneath her so as the babies come out they fall down the trough 
okay 
and there 's a hole in the middle so they fall onto the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can n't get to them either 
oh 
and that 's you know 
it it kind of works 
but it 's also got slots in it so the water can circulate and on occasion if you get a real small one 
right 
it 'll fit out the slots 
they will go through the slot 
that 's right 
so but you know it works i guess 
that works all right th- 
they do n't uh w- want the mothers to be with the little fishies 
yeah oh they 'll eat them 
they will 
yeah 
is n't that odd 
yes 
you would n't think that 
it and it 's funny because the one i have every single month without fail she has babies 
tha- you 're kidding 
and oh no 
a- all the time 
and um i 've 
and she 's supposed to 
her variety it says they wo n't eat the babies 
and i 've seen her do it 
so 
uh-huh that just makes you sick almost does n't it 
oh it 's terr- 
well i mean it makes you understand that you know things are different 
yeah things are different in the animal kingdom huh 
you know we might right we might decide what 's proper and what is n't 
but you know that 's the way it is for them 
yeah 
that 's kind of the way they do it 
yeah 
that 's it 
survival of the fittest or something 
yeah 
because if the baby 's strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide 
right 
go hide from them 
well and then you think well how do they do it out in the real world anyway when these li- fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
but if you 're like me you never have enough time for the hobbies 
yeah huh no 
not really 
i i try 
i a- i also i play a couple of instruments 
uh it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year 
but uh it 's it 's camping 
really 
when was the last time you went 
the last time i went camping was about uh in the middle of october 
and we went up to lake bonham and really enjoyed it 
had a real good time with the family 
we do an awful lot of camping 
how about yourself 
well i have n't been in probably about three years 
uh-huh 
and the last time we went was in um 
well i guess it was it was like hunting season 
and we went down to like a hunting ground and a lake lake sam rayburn which is in east texas 
uh-huh 
yes 
oh very good 
i bet it 's pretty over there 
it is real pretty 
um let 's see 
what do you think 
what kind of camping uh are you talking about 
do you do a lot of fishing 
do you go out 
and is camping for you in a motor home or a trailer 
or do you actually put up a tent 
the 
and one of the ones that you pull along and then pop u- is it pop up 
whole bit oh okay 
so you have 
yeah 
a pop up trailer huh 
pop up 
yeah 
what do you have 
how fun we have a tent 
a tent 
yes 
so i guess we really rough it 
really 
and we really enjoy that 
uh one thing uh 
i 've done all sorts of camping 
i 've i 've camped uh in the snow on a glacier 
i 've camped uh basically almost anywhere even to a point where we 've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that that camping trip and had to pack it back out 
so you 're a serious camper 
well we enjoy it 
yeah 
but since i 've been married and with a family uh we have to go where there 's restrooms 
well that makes sense 
and playgrounds and so forth 
so we really enjoy it 
but also while i was growing up we did have a trailer 
and uh i 've camped in in a trailer and in a tent and in in log cabins and so forth too 
so a lot of different things 
and yes i to answer your questions earlier yes i we do enjoy fishing 
and i do go fishing 
have n't done a whole lot down here 
we recently moved from the rocky mountain area up in uh northern utah down to here because of work and uh have n't been able to enjoy fishing like i used to up there whi- which is uh clear water fishing and streams and and rivers 
but when y 'all went camping is that what you normally i mean what did you normally do 
uh we normally yeah we did we did a lot of fishing 
but mainly what we did is we did a lot of hiking and exploring and just going out and seeing what there was to see uh in the area 
i guess probably just where ever you live at then has a lot to do with where what you 're going to do when you go 
and you do actually camp 
oh yes 
that 's true 
that 's true 
and 
did you ever like travel around to what 's that the little ko k- koa camps whenever you ever done that 
no 
we never did that 
they 
although i 've stayed in koa campgrounds uh we 've never done that just to go around and camp 
um personally i when i when we were growing up and when we were uh going camping i thought that was little too structured of a camp ground 
yeah 
um you know that was mainly for people in motor homes or or had trailers or s- and so on and so forth where you know we really wanted to go camping in a tent and uh koa i- is is geared for the people that have a hook up 
um 
hum they actually travel from what city to city state to state 
right 
exactly 
and uh i started out basically camping when i was when i was in boy scouts 
and we did an awful lot of that as as a boy scout group 
as i mentioned earlier we went into wilderness areas 
and we camped in the snow in in uh snow caves 
and and uh 
that 's probably where i first started was in girl scouts 
all right 
and you got a lot of that in huh 
yeah 
what do you like to do when you go camping 
um well let 's see 
i just i mean i just like to go 
and no- normally i go with a whole group of friends and we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff 
um-hum 
enjoy it huh 
roast marshmallows 
tell scaries or scary stories around the fire 
and 
yeah 
or um take a deck of cards if we if we can actually see and um play cards and stuff 
and so on oh yeah 
you know that uh lot a lot of people i 've talked to have said well is n't camping boring 
do n't you get we- do n't you uh get bored and not have anything to do 
but i 've found out that actually we we really enjoy getting away from the television the telephone and yes 
yeah 
it 's relaxing 
exactly 
get out getting out and enjoying nature and ea- each other- uh company when we 're out camping 
plus you um kind of makes you appreciate some lot of the things you take for granted 
yeah 
running water your hair dryer curling iron 
like like running water and a and a private bathroom 
and yes 
we- what about your family 
do your kids and everything like to 
yes 
they really do 
they have a great time 
and like i mentioned uh the we 've we 've been been camping a couple of times this year 
and the last time was in october 
and we went up to lake bonham 
and there is a playground for them 
and so they have swings and they have sli- 
well 
do you do you have uh some strong feelings one way or the other about about the care of the elderly 
well yes 
i do 
um this is a a question that hit pretty close to home 
uh i had to go through this with my dad about four years ago 
he was his health was failing and uh he was adamant about two things 
um-hum 
one was that i take care of my mother 
and two that he not be put into a home 
um-hum 
and we talked about some length 
and i respected his wishes 
he uh stayed at home as long as he could 
and then uh he died in a hospital 
but um i think that my position wa- is that uh you you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care of the of their uh of their clients and um because i 've heard about the many abuses and because he had heard of so many abuses he just did n't want that 
um-hum yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
how about you 
well my graduate work is in speech pathology 
and uh so so uh i 've thought about this more than once uh you know dealing with uh you know 
i 'm concerned we 're going to have a geriatric uh population 
in in twenty years it 's going to be you know phenomenal 
yeah 
almost thirty a- all over thirty percent is n't it 
ye- yeah 
yeah 
uh and um but i have been amazed 
and and in talking with uh some of my fellow students it looks as though um nursing homes are not going to be the only option anymore 
and uh in twenty years 
uh where a lot of students are hoping uh to work as an in the home type uh uh app- approach where where the uh where there 's the s- you know the speech therapist or whether it 's a nursing uh specialist or someone plans to uh work out of a family 's home and take the responsibility away from the family but yet allow the the loved one to stay you know at home with the family members 
um-hum 
uh it it 's it 's difficult for many families especially in the case of uh o- of alzheimer 's and and uh some of the more degenerative diseases to uh say uh uh leave them to to have them at home because then the family becomes completely uh exactly 
they 're captives 
yeah 
and and did did you experience that with your with your father or not 
uh we had a at one stage we had care somewhat like like what you 're talking about 
we had the visiting nurses program and they sent somebody in 
um-hum 
and it it was a a nominal charge that this uh 
it started out the lady would come in i think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day 
yeah 
they would try to get him to exercise 
they would try to uh you know 
they would check him over temperature you know 
the basic checks 
try to get him to talk and be motivated and uh that 's what we went through 
uh-huh 
uh up to a points things seemed to be working 
and then i i think he he became discouraged and they did not know how to take care of that 
right 
and then um at that point i think it mostly a psychological problem 
uh-huh oh 
and uh but yes 
i agree there 's a lot of options 
there could be a lot of options 
uh-huh 
i think it 's time that uh we decide to do something about it 
yeah 
um 
definitely 
you know uh one of the other subjects on the on the switchboard and this is one that i 've that i 've been thinking applies here uh where where uh young o- young kids uh graduating from high school whether they should do a community service type work 
this would be an excellent example of somewhere uh someplace where um the community could be more involved you know more than just leaving it only to professionals 
there is a lot the community the community can do to uh enhance the or or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home 
i suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need 
possibly before 
i do n't know now 
yeah 
the church or synagogue whatever because typically these were close-knit groups at one time 
uh-huh 
but in today 's large metropolitan areas or even in most even even the rural areas now people are not quite as close as they once were 
hum-um 
uh the mobility factor the factor that uh oh we 're living longer and people are less trusting all these things tend to destroy this type of system 
but i agree with you 
it it might be some possibilities there 
oh 
although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just are n't emotionally prepared to do 
i agree 
that 's a that 's a good point 
i think they would have to have some training so- 
say arlington texas 
now since i got somebody from arlington virginia one day 
is that right 
yeah 
yeah well i never thought about that 
but there is an arlington 
like i- i had a card the other day from birmingham michigan uh you know 
oh birmingham 
and i was thinking yeah and i was thinking 
the only birmingham i could think of was alabama 
right 
it 's funny how many names have been used uh all over the country 
yeah 
well tell me what kind of books have you read 
but uh well to tell you the truth i 've been going to college for the last four years 
so mainly text books 
i was going to say not fun kind right 
no um 
but i- i really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones but you know sometimes biogra- 
uh-huh 
i just read one about grace kelly 
i- i love to read about real people 
to me half the time it 's more fascinating than some of these made up stories 
yeah 
it is 
because you know that it 's really and truly a the true thing 
yeah 
it ha- it happened 
you know i read one about bob hope that i liked 
really 
yeah 
that was real good 
i 'm like you 
if it 's not a heavy biography you know i enjoy it 
right 
i used to like to read about royalty a lot 
i r- when i was younger i read about every king and queen that lived i think in europe 
that was my thing for a while 
i 'm trying to think uh 
i read a uh a novel that used the names of like princess di and prince phillip coming over here to be entertained and all 
and there was a murder 
oh really 
yeah 
it was sometime ago 
seems like it was the spy went dancing or something like that 
oh it sounds like fun 
uh it was a lot of fun because they used these real names you know 
wonder if it was by one of those famous writers you know 
margaret truman daniels writes a lot of those 
yes 
in fact i believe it was 
because 
really 
uh-huh 
i believe 
sounds like something she would write 
i- yeah 
i think it was by her that you mention it because uh someone had given it to me 
and i thought well this will be great 
and it was 
yeah 
i 've hear- heard that she 's done real you know her books are really interesting 
and they always sell well 
you know um-hum 
and uh 
well when you use real people like that i think you know and royalty especially you know 
yeah 
brings it to life 
i know uh the bri- some of the british people laugh at us because we 're so enthralled with their royalty 
yeah 
but you know that 's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth you know 
i know 
our movie stars 
our movie stars 
because it 's totally different concept to us 
oh right 
but i have n't i have n't had a chance to read a lot lately either 
i have read uh mostly novels 
i went to visit my daughter in florida and i took a novel with me oh and read it at thanksgiving time 
um 
and um it was uh one of those generation novels you know starts out when they 're small and continues through generations and i like that 
oh yes 
oh i always like those 
have you ever read anything by susan howatch 
you know yes 
i have 
is n't she fabulous 
oh she is wonderful 
oh once you st- 
i do n't like to get one of her books 
because i- i just live to read 
i 'll i 'll skip everything just to get back to the book 
i stayed up one night i think till two in the morning finishing one of hers because i star- i could not put it down 
oh yeah 
she 's just uh 
i do n't know 
-s she how often does she come out with them 
i probably have missed the last few since i 've been back in school 
well no 
it seems like she does n't write as often as oh well like danielle steele and those silly things 
she writes the same thing 
oh well she can she can turn them out overnight i swear 
yeah 
and and they 're the same silly things 
i mean if you 've read one there i mean it 's you know it 's it it 's practically the same thing over and over you know 
yeah 
i 've never read a whole one of hers i do n't think 
and think how rich she is 
yeah 
would n't i you know 
i 'm criticizing her 
and would n't i like to have her money you know because they go from hardback to paperback 
oh yeah 
and she has millions of them 
and then make movies out of some of them 
um-hum 
you know miniseries and so forth 
but i seems to me like susan howatch does not write as often 
i have not seen as many of hers 
or right well hers are so involved 
and they 're and so such a higher intellectual level because she quotes a lot you know 
um-hum 
i think she does a lot of research too 
i do too 
so she could n't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers 
huh-uh 
but oh her books are just incredible 
i do n't think they 've ever made a movie do you 
yeah no 
i do n't think so 
and i 've often wondered why have n't you 
yes well no uh 
you know i 
i really just thought about it now 
but there 's j- 
yeah 
maybe it 's because they take so much in 
i do n't know 
um-hum 
maybe they 're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them you know 
um-hum they 're so big they 're such you know 
um-hum 
it would be like another gone with the wind i guess a three hour movie 
yeah 
well and maybe that turns people off 
but look at gone with the wind you know 
oh i know 
it 's about one of my favorite movies 
uh have you uh gotten into scarlett yet 
no 
it had such a bad press 
i was n't too 
i yeah 
that 's exactly what i was going to say 
i was amazed 
because i 
in the beginning when it was on you know on route coming out i heard mixed publicity you know kind of good and bad 
intrigued um-hum 
right 
and then when it came out all i heard was just uh how bad it was that i did n't even want to get it 
me either 
do you know anyone that 's read it 
hum-um 
no 
i have n't heard of anybody that 's read it either 
no 
but it wa- i think it was on the best-seller list though for a while 
well it would n't surprise me 
about the weather 
oh yes 
uh very appropriate i guess 
uh you ready for this 
uh yeah 
okay john 
just a moment 
well guess what 
we get to talk about the weather 
the weather is uh this time of year has actually been kind of unusual 
i 've expected it to be colder until you know 
what we 've gotten last couple days 
uh uh-huh 
i do n't know 
i- i fly for a living 
and i 've uh 
the weather 's been terribly unusual every where i 've been 
oh you do so you you you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather 
yeah 
yeah 
and imagine it 's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather 
yeah tha- way it was around here last night 
i 'll tell you that 
well actually i 'm i 've i 've heard on the news that we uh will be setting a record here in the state of texas for the uh large amounts of rain and moisture we 've had this year that it 's going to break all kind of records that were set set set back since nineteen thirty two 
no kidding 
so yeah 
hm 
if it uh keeps on raining like this 
and i understand it 's supposed to rain until saturday night 
saturday or sunday they were saying 
yeah 
oh yes 
yeah 
i know the systems have been real strong out 
i went through uh phoenix on twice on uh wednesday morning and uh shot approaches to low minimum it was both both times you know and phoenix never gets that kind of weather 
so we 're going to uh-huh 
wow 
so 
well so are you an airline pilot 
yes 
i am with southwest 
oh great 
yeah 
with southwest 
fantastic 
i have a brother i have a brother that 's a pilot also with american 
yep yeah yeah oh is that right 
yes 
and so i imagine you uh oh with all this kind of weather it 's uh makes it kind of dangerous for you 
well now i no i would n't call it danger 
this is uh this really is n't bad stuff to fly around in 
this is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the springtime 
oh i guess so 
yeah 
you 
know th- the the air systems are reasonably calm 
you do n't have uh the turbulence you know you little bit of chop 
um-hum 
but it 's not like it is in the spring time 
oh yes 
well we moved actually down here from another location 
and it 's spectacular the the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain 
so spectacular is the right word for them 
pardon me 
spectacular is a good word for them 
i 've never seen a thunder show like i 've seen down here before i- in texas 
it 's amazing 
lights up the whole sky and even on a on a 
actually i 've i 've seen it where there 's not a cloud in the sky 
it 's a cloudless night 
and the rain is n't falling 
but you can see the thunder and ligh- excuse me see the lightning going horizontally across the sky and and back and forth and what a light show 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah cloud to cloud it can be real really sensational here 
it 's it 's fabulous 
y- 
yes that 's true 
yeah really where you from originally 
i 'm from uh northern utah 
and that 's a very arid climate from uh salt lake city area and there 's always a lot of snow 
um-hum 
in fact where i grew up we were about an hour 's drive from seven to uh twelve different major ski resorts 
and so there was an awful lot of snow 
oh 
and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and and sleigh riding and everything else 
oh yeah 
oh oh yeah yeah 
so we had a great time 
were you near p- they were near the park cities area 
and um yeah 
in a in snowbird and solitude and and brighton and yes all those areas 
yeah that 's beautiful area 
um-hum 
so i imagine have you skied before 
well we 've skied 
i have not skied that area 
um-hum 
i 've driven through it several times 
uh i 've skie- we skied california a bunch when we lived out there 
and and uh um and of course grew we grew up in minnesota 
um-hum 
and we do some skiing there lot of cross country skiing there 
oh yes 
oh yes yeah 
great 
well do you think this the the weather is typical for this time of the year 
well not really 
i you know 
minnesota 's gotten just hammered with snow um 
the uh the um uh 
we 've getting a fair amount of rain for this time of year already i- i think and uh i 've been surprised that we have n't seen more of the temperatures that we 've got today you know that moved in last night 
yes 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's been it 's been cold 
there was a time though in the uh middle part of november that got really cool real- really unseasonably cool and then it warmed right back up 
yeah 
yes 
it did 
and i thought great and that 's that 's a fun th- 
yeah 
yeah 
uh my wife was just listening here 
and she said yeah 
it froze in fact 
yeah 
yeah it was it was real cold 
that 
wa- that was very unseasonable for us down here 
and uh but uh i 've really enjoyed the weather down here too 
because uh two years ago we were the day after christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weath- weather 
and it 's not as severe i should say as the weather that i 've experienced up in northern utah 
yeah 
oh yeah 
that 's that 's real true 
same with us from minnesota 
i- it 's uh 
in fact i 've i played golf on the f- on the new year 's day one year 
down here 
you know it was yeah 
yeah 
not in minnesota 
no 
no 
no 
no 
i have a brother-in-law that lives in minnesota 
and they say boy six months out of the year it 's bitter cold and and the wind and the blowing snow and everything 
oh it is 
it is 
well and they 've had uh you know 
usually in minnesota they get their snow in january and uh february 
it 's um-hum 
and they 're up over sixty five or sixty 
do you see as uh the changes that have occurred in the last ten then beverly 
i think one of the thing that i notice a lot 
i know it 's touching social changes 
but uh to me what becomes socially acceptable 
and i i do n't know if it 's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it 's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction 
but i notice things on tv being more um open more i i believe that 
they portray things on tv obviously that they never would 've years ago 
and you know and specifically nudity things like that um 
i- i do n't know 
i i 've said several times to my husband that i feel like jeez in ten years they 'll have just full nudity on tv 
and nobody 'll think anything of it 
and to me that 's surprising 
to me that 's that 's a big change to accept it 
and it comes across i think subtly you know little at a time to where you get so used to seeing a little change that you know when they go uh one step further you do n't notice it that much 
so that 's one of the biggest ones i 've seen 
huh 
yeah 
that 's a big one 
what about you 
well i think that society has come to a point where th- they 're not responsible for any of their actions 
somebody else uh made them do it 
uh that 's what i seem to see a lot of that uh no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices 
it 's rather sue these guys because they made a f- uh a seat belt that did n't work right 
or well that 's what i think is a big one 
um-hum 
i tend to agree with you 
and i think there 's a lot of that 
um ah yeah 
we have become lawsuit happy 
any little thing it 's like let 's see what i can get 
do n't you think that maybe a lot of that came from um oh you know the the the era we went through that was like you know hey if it makes you happy do it 
you know kind of like disregard to others 
do what makes you happy 
and and yes 
we should take care of ourselves you know 
and we should see to our own lives but not to a total disregard of others 
um i do n't know 
i think it 's come to that a lot 
i see it a lot in my daughter 
i have a four year old 
but uh-huh 
and hers is n't a social thing as much as it 's a stage they go through 
but whenever something happens it 's you made me hit that 
you made me do this 
and so i try to tell her brianna everything is n't always somebody else 's fault 
you know you have to watch where you 're going 
and and so it 's what you just said 
sure 
kind of hits home to me just through her 
so 
yeah 
and another thing i think has changed quite a bit is uh the roles that men and women play 
that 's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly 
i think you 're right 
um in your opinion good or bad or both 
well both you know 
there 's some great things that uh have come about with more equality 
but i think that also 
i do n't know what 's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that because i think that 's bad for us 
i do too 
i think part of that 
i- i do n't know 
i think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like i- in terms of their self confident confidence their self-worth you know i can do something 
i can be somebody you know 
if i put my mind to it i can accomplish things too 
and i think that 's good 
but um i think when you push you know maybe i think when that was first trying come about with you know what we know as the women 's lib movement i think it was too extreme 
um-hum 
um i think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too you know 
and i think there 's definite roles 
and i think you know part of the break up of the family maybe it 's because of the the the social changes i do n't know the fact that ah during their early changes where you know women did come more speak may- maybe speak out i was going to say come more out of themselves but speak out 
i think a lot of men were threatened by that 
i think now less men are you know because they 're used to it 
it 's around them 
um but i i do n't know 
i i i do n't know why the families are breaking up 
i think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions because it 's like they do n't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is going to work 
they go in and say well hey you know i 'll stick with it while it 's good 
and then i 'll get out 
and i i- i think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment 
um-hum yeah 
i would agree with you 
ah so 
-ay what are your favorite shows 
well i it 's does n't seem like i get enough time to watch much tv 
but um the ones that are out now 
uh-huh 
i i 've watched that sisters a couple of times 
i think that 's kind of a good show 
i 've never seen that 
have n't yet 
oh i like that one 
and um well i 'm trying to think 
i i do n't even know if i have any other real regular ones that i watch 
how about you 
um i like la law not because it 's realistic but it 's entertaining 
oh uh-huh 
i 
yeah i do like that 
um 
occasionally i 'll see that one 
let 's see 
i watch cheers sometimes and mostly just movies when there 's a good movie on 
do you 
uh-huh 
actually when there is n't a good movie on too 
oh 
i just like to have the tv on if you know if i 'm home alone or something have 
oh uh-huh 
either the radio or the tvs got to be on at all times 
oh 
uh yeah oh i do 
i have kind of gotten into a couple of soaps lately 
oh really 
i 've well i 've been home with a um 
i have a baby 
and and so i 've have n't seemed to have gotten out as much 
uh-huh 
and so i 'll i 'll watch a soap occasionally 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
do you watch any of those 
i well i do n't because i work all day 
uh-huh 
but um i pro- 
i usually do if i 'm home for a couple of days like you know around christmas or whatever 
after a while i 'll start watching it and then um 
uh-huh 
for a while i 'll ask people if they know what happened and then i 'll just forget it 
oh what what what ones do you get into 
oh i do n't even remember 
the last time i watched was back in college 
it was like general hospital or something and i maybe watched it for a week but um i know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around those you know 
oh uh-huh 
oh 
they would n't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera 
how fu- funny 
oh yeah 
it was i 
oh i do n't get into them that much 
when when i 'm home sometimes in the day i 'll i 'll watch them but yeah uh oh i i was really trying to think 
mean um-hum 
um-hum 
i do n't even know if there 's any other shows that i watch real 
well you said you have kids 
how old 
oh i have a six year old 
and i have a um 
he 'll be a year old in january 
so you 're you are n't a sesame street fan 
well they do they watch it 
my six year old 's kind of 
he 's outgrown that one a little bit 
but but i 've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby 
uh-huh 
and he 's kind of he 's entertained by it 
uh-huh 
so yes 
i i do watch that one 
supposed to be a great babysitter 
on occasion yeah 
well they 're not entertained for too long with it 
he 's he 's still too little 
but yeah 
yeah 
i do turn that on 
hm 
and i i do like um donahue 
um-hum 
-times i watch that 
i think he has some interesting things on it 
i know 
which what time is that on 
i never see it 
um that 's on at let 's see it 's on at four 
oh okay 
i 'm not home then 
that 's why i do n't see it 
yeah 
i 'll watch that occasionally 
he 's got some real 
i do n't know 
there 's some real weird people that he seems to come up with 
well is n't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange 
uh yes 
yes 
oh yeah 
but he he does have some real bizarre things i think 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
um goll- other than that i do n't know 
what 's that 
i guess i 'm not much of a tv person really 
yeah 
well i guess it was n't a real good topic for us 
but well tell me 
is it snowing up there 
um no 
no 
um it snowed a little bit um probably about four days ago and and they said we were n't going to get any more for christmas 
uh-huh 
wow but do you have snow on the ground now 
yeah there is snow on the ground 
oh 
well that 's nice 
i i wish it would snow a little bit more 
but i 've heard it 's raining there 
oh gosh 
we 've broken all sorts of records 
oh really 
they 've got 
i mean we still have some highways closed 
and it stopped raining almost twenty four hours ago 
oh my goodness 
but um oh just phenomenal 
i mean i you know 
you see it on the news all the time 
but until you 've really seen it it doe- it does n't really hit you 
yeah 
but i was driving home from work friday 
and i saw there were some stop signs i mean submerged up to the writing on the stop sign 
and that was just it was amazing to me 
oh goodness 
oh jeez 
so 
so 
so there has been some flooding 
and 
oh there 's been a lot 
yeah 
it 's it 's too bad 
but you know the thing is that this happens 
in the last three years it 's happened at least once a year if not twice but the people continue to move back in the flood zones 
yeah well that 's awf- uh-huh 
oh jeez 
so i do n't know 
i mean you got to wonder how long they 're going to keep doing that for 
yeah 
i do n't think i would 
oh boy 
because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood 
we- yeah 
oh what a mess 
yeah 
well i thought you work for t i 
yeah 
i do 
yeah 
oh do you oh uh-huh 
huh yeah i know this has been an interesting thing to do 
have you made a lot of calls 
or 
um i 've i 've probably talked to maybe just five people 
uh-huh 
my my husband uh is doing it too 
he 's had a few more than me 
oh 
and but it 's been real interesting and kind of fun 
do you get paid for these 
um five dollars 
five dollars a call 
uh-huh 
gosh 
i wish i could do that 
yeah but you have to do it as part is 
we can n't get paid for it 
so uh what kind of home repair work have you done 
well um done a little uh repair on the um shingles on the roof recently 
we 've had a lot of wind around here 
y 'all been pulling them up huh or just loosening them until the rain came in 
yes 
uh it looks like i 'm going to have to get up there again because we may have a leak 
are you in the section of texas that 's been getting so much rain 
we 've been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around san antonio 
but uh well i 'm right 
uh plano is just north of dallas and uh there are parts of downtown or near downtown dallas are under water right now i guess 
oh okay 
i saw on the news 
yeah 
so you 're probably what about halfway -cross the state from san antonio though are n't you 
well we 're up uh we 're north in um oh about uh i do n't know uh eighty to a hundred miles uh south of the oklahoma line i guess 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
but you 're still getting a good bit of the rain though 
uh we did have a little bit of rain yesterday 
so far we have n't had any today 
and uh i suppose that means i should be uh getting up there to look at that uh shingle 
but uh i had something else planned today 
yeah 
so i guess i 'll let it go awhile 
yeah 
is it asphalt shingles 
or or 
they 're uh 
no 
they 're uh uh wood shake 
clay ooh 
that should be a lot of fun 
yeah 
di- did you put them up originally or you just uh uh going up stopping leaks in them 
no 
i 
uh as a matter of fact we 've never had a leak actually yet 
now this 
we just bought the house last year 
and um uh just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles 
so i 've just recently had to start looking at it myself 
yeah 
so it 's a small problem so far 
but i guess you just have to keep on top of it 
what kind of roof do you have 
uh we were in um uh campus apartment buildings with flat top uh 
oh well then you do n't have to do too much wi- 
not too much 
they 're just tar and gravel uh treated flat top roofs 
uh-huh 
have you got pretty low pitch on that roof or is it pretty steep 
oh it 's pretty steep 
um parts of it are steeper than others 
well what do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal 
well uh you wear uh shoes with good traction and and and try to remember where you are at all times 
yeah 
i imagine i imagine 
and remember to yell geronimo if uh all else fails 
anyway yeah 
yeah 
that would be just too much of a fall for me 
um have you been uh 
visit was the house reasonably new 
or you been doing some remodeling work on it 
it 's actually just twelve years old now 
or that 's pretty new house yet 
yeah 
it um 
this part of the country 
actually they they say that when the house is uh fifteen it 's already old 
but uh if you take good care of it 
yeah 
thing is 
we 've um the main thing that we 've had with this house recently has been some um uh s- squirming i call it of the foundation 
we 're just on a concrete slab you know but uh the soil right under this is a clay 
yeah 
and it um 
it 's settling unevenly 
well it uh depending on it 's moisture content it either swells up or shrinks 
and um course the soil right under the slab retains it 's moisture a lot longer and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from uh from uh drooping and um but anytime there 's a change in the weather like the temperature uh drastic changes in temperature or in uh moisture uh you get little spider web cracks all around uh windows and doors 
yeah 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
well that sounds like a lot of fun 
well usually what you do is just wait until you think it 's stopped 
and then you patch them up 
hm what is it like uh stucco walls or 
uh well this is all uh it 's all drywall uh i think with um yeah 
or wood all drywall 
wood framing 
right 
okay 
but uh somehow or other that does manage to uh show these little cracks 
i do n't know quite how that works 
maybe it is n't drywall 
i do n't really know 
well if they 've plastered over drywall 
yeah 
i think it is 
i remember my parents home is drywalled and then they uh almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall give it a textured sort of a look 
i expect that 's what it is 
yeah 
and made for kind of a hard shell on the on the drywall 
yeah 
i think that 's the way this is done 
fortunately we have n't had any real big holes in it yet 
so i 
well 
that 's good 
yeah 
well 
that would that would be in terri- terribly exasperating to have the a slab floor like that swelling and giving like that 
yes 
well the uh previous owner had a major problem with it because um oh probably a variety of things 
uh his neighbor used to ha- 
do you have any children 
yeah 
i have two two boys twelve and sixteen 
twelve and sixteen 
um-hum 
how about you 
well i have three 
and uh they 're five and three and nineteen months 
oh 
so we kind of got a different ball game 
but uh 
right 
what uh 
do you feel like you have anytime to spend with them 
well 
they 're probably at an age where they do n't want to spend anytime with their p- parents 
that 's true 
you actually of course spend less time with them when they get older 
but it 's of course still really important 
right 
um i have a kind of a fortunate situation i think right now with my sixteen year old 
um i work two nights a week at a 
i 'm a librarian and i work two nights a week at the senior high school library 
oh uh-huh 
they keep it open you know for kids to do their work and he um and then they the school district hires an aide you know to work for me 
right 
sure 
well my son is my aide 
oh well that 's nice 
so two nights a week for four hours we 're stuck together and there 's usually not very much business 
you 're stuck together 
no 
i mean some nights it 's just real real quiet 
so 
i would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part 
yeah so we i have sort of a captive audience 
so i really do spend probably more time with him than than most you know 
right 
but um of course i 'm away from my other son those hours too 
but his dad 's at home pretty much that time 
and so that kind of gives him uh time with his dad then 
yeah 
that 's true 
yeah 
gives him a little bit of that individual time 
but but it is hard once they get that age 
i mean their friends are the most important thing there is 
right 
and they want to be able to spend uh 
that 's right 
well i 've even noticed that with my five year old she started kindergarten this year 
and everyday that she 's not at school uh she thinks we need to have someone over and play and that kind of yeah 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
it 's kind of hard 
it 's hard 
i think uh i find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that i should 
yeah 
i 'm more worried about oh 
i did n't get this done 
i did n't get 
the kitchen needs to be cleaned this needs to be done 
um-hum 
and and i need to re- re- remind myself to slow down 
um-hum 
and it 'll still be there tomorrow 
right 
yeah 
that 's true 
but that 's kind of hard to do you know 
yes 
it is hard to do 
right 
yeah 
you do n't see yourself getting 
well if you 're kind of a person that likes things you know organized or neat or you know then i think it that it is hard 
um-hum 
right 
it 's um 
i think one of the nice things about holidays is that you know it does give you the opportunity to spend more time yeah with family 
slow down a little bit 
we have we often go to illinois for christmas 
um-hum uh-huh 
and we 're not this year 
and it 's just really nice because we can do you know the things you want to do 
you can do a lot more than than when you travel 
and yeah 
just yeah 
that 's right 
this is the first year we 're staying home too 
and uh i think it 's going to be real quiet 
but uh that 's an opportunity to get out the games 
and 
yeah 
right 
we usually do that 
my my kids even have already gotten out um 
my twelve year old got out the legos which of course he has n't touched since last summer but you know but every now and then i mean he 's got a lot of those technic- those hard kind 
right 
of cou- of course 
you know and he wants to be an engineer 
so he still likes all that kind of building stuff 
oh yeah 
and um we have the train 
and we have n't had that lego train together for years 
and um so he sat down 
and i told him i really wanted him to build the train 
and we would put it under the tree and that i would keep it together 
i would n't take it apart yeah 
ca- would n't take it apart after that 
and every year i 'd have the lego train under the tree 
that 'd be kind of fun 
and um so he worked on that for the longest time ever since school was out on friday 
and um then his sixteen year old brother started helping too you know 
so you know it was just kind of things like during the normal rat race those kinds of things never happen but 
right 
right 
no no 
in fact in i think if a people would learn to turn off the tvs 
and i think that 's a lot of the breakdown of the communication any communication that would take place in a family 
um um-hum 
yeah 
yes 
yeah 
which is 
uh usually people are ending up sitting in front of that 
um-hum 
and there 's always a few people in the family that when they stare at it you know they 're totally turned off to everything else 
the rest of 
yes 
you can n't communicate while you 're doing that right 
no 
that 's right 
whereas uh i 'm the type of person i could not s- sit s- well 
i should n't say i could not 
but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something 
yeah 
yeah 
me too 
yeah 
i do n't watch very much of it at all e- to to the extent that sometimes i feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that people are yeah 
because they talk so much 
is n't that the 
they talk about tv shows 
and i 'm huh 
you know do n't you watch that you know it 's the best show on 
you 're kind of like wha- what are you talking about 
and uh 
i go no but 
you feel like you 're a little bit out of it do n't you 
they need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what 's the 
okay 
all set 
good morning 
yeah good morning 
let 's see 
music um 
well i play a couple of instruments 
um-hum 
i try to 
what do you play 
um clarinet 's my primary instrument 
and i also play a little bit of saxophone flute and piano when i get the opportunity which is n't very often 
uh-huh 
really 
that 's too bad 
but um how about yourself 
i 'm i play uh the violin and play trumpet and i run a municipal band 
uh-huh 
wow 
and i sometimes conduct 
oh wow 
so i 'm pretty busy too 
i play in three different symphony orchestras 
wow 
we have a nice big one here in state college called the nitny valley symphony 
that 's great 
uh-huh 
i play in the altoona symphony 
was about f- forty five miles away and i play in a slightly smaller one called the lockhaven uh symphony and community orchestra 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
so are you a professional musician 
and no 
i 'm uh just retiring from penn state university i mean i i sh- should 've been 
no uh-huh 
i spend about half my time playing music or preparing for it somewhere 
uh-huh 
but uh i 've been working at uh penn state and using up all my nighttimes and weekends and i go in to these orchestra rehearsals and and concerts and so forth 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
i understand 
yeah 
i 'm in one community band here 
and that 's just 
well we rehearse once a week 
we generally have a concert every other week 
and 
you have one that often 
yeah 
that 's amazing because i uh i have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert 
it 's a lot 
no 
we sure do n't 
wowie 
well one thing is we have a summer se- summer series 
and every single sunday night we play at the library to have a little ou- outdoor stage set up and so we do that every sunday night during the summer 
um-hum 
you are busy 
yeah 
and then i do n't know we just have an awful lot of engagements 
and we 're just having to turn a lot of people down um because you know uh we do n't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row 
where wh- where do you get all this music 
i mean y- you must back up play some of the music twice 
oh yes 
definitely 
we really do 
you know you get your little sousa book 
and you just flip through it and that sort of thing 
oh okay 
so your you do n't uh play a pretty well a full concert band music most of the time huh 
so uh it really depends on who shows up 
um-hum 
um and it 's always a mystery 
because it actually does n't matter who shows up 
it matters what instruments they brought 
because so many people switch instruments so often 
right 
um-hum 
but um yeah 
in the winter we do more concert stuff 
and 
how many people in your band 
um i think there 's about seventy 
seventy 
yeah 
there 's a lot 
holy mackerel 
that 's 
but on any given night there 's not seventy you know 
uh-huh 
i- it alternates quite a lot 
boy 
that is a huge organization 
that 's great 
yeah 
it really is 
because about the best i can normally hope for is about fifty in in the band i have here 
well 
yeah 
well 
but that fills a stage and keeps us busy 
but they run ha- half of them professionals from uh a lot of them are from uh faculty at penn state here 
oh okay 
and so they want to play things that uh push them to do 
so that 's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together 
um-hum 
we have about four concerts per year indoors and two or three that we play outside 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and the last one we did was in a large uh mall close here 
to p- uh we played christmas about an hour out in this mall 
um-hum 
yeah um-hum 
so that worked out very nicely 
um-hum yeah 
that 's fun 
yeah 
well let 's see 
well there 's another band around here 
so- someone at work is trying to get me to join that one because they need clarinet players and their concert schedule is n't as heavy 
um-hum 
but they have more in the summer 
i think they have ten in the summer you know one one week after the other 
i think they 're like monday nights and they do n't have rehearsals during that time period 
wow 
that 
are you just saying that you sight read every concert 
uh well it 's not really sight reading when you 've done it you know again and again and again 
but some people are 
okay 
yeah some of them are 
um-hum 
okay and where does where does this happen laurie 
is this in dallas 
um well they 're in the suburbs of dallas in richardson and plano 
um-hum 
real real close to dallas 
well i declare 
uh 
that 's amazing 
yeah 
well it 's more of a i think it 's very much more of a social group than anything else you know 
okay 
um a- and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so 
okay 
and that 's probably why we get so many people 
um-hum 
do any of your you in your group get paid for any of this 
um well the conductor gets paid a little bit you know 
we we do get some money from the city because we do play at a lot of city events 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um i think he 's the only one that gets paid 
uh-huh 
and well you do have to buy your music 
who who sponsors you basically the city 
um the city 
uh-huh 
yeah um 
my band is sponsored through what they call parks and recreation 
yeah 
it 's a similar thing 
yeah 
i can n't remember what they call it 
but the same type of thing 
um-hum 
um but we do get an awful lot of music you know 
we can borrow music from any of the area colleges or you know if if some some group just is n't going to play anymore they 'll just give us their music and that type of thing 
yes 
um-hum 
and we do an awful lot of you know 
we do n't charge for any of our performances 
but we get a lot of donations 
well i i work the same way 
so yeah 
well i 'll be darned 
it 's ama- 
uh let 's see 
personal computers 
yes 
so do you use them 
uh yes um 
we own one 
terrific 
what kind 
uh its an emerson eighty eighty six um two low density floppy drives and no hard drive yet 
but uh you know it 's it comes in mighty handy 
mostly for word processing type things 
uh yeah 
a big chunk of it 's word processing 
we 're also taking programming classes 
and uh so there 's a fair amount of programming getting done on it 
but uh the uh 
right now we got a project going we 're trying to put um all my wife 's stray recipes on the disk 
nice 
did you buy a program to handle menus 
uh it came with a menus program 
but uh that does n't 
it is mostly 
excuse me 
mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive and hopefully sometime this spring we 'll be able to get one and get it configured 
oh yes 
there 's eighty eighty eight is what you said 
eighty 
eighty 
oh gosh it 's worth your time to just upgrade 
they 're so darned cheap now 
eighty six 
which 
computers 
ah impoverished college student 
oh no 
this one went on a credit card 
and we got a way out while to pay it off yet 
so it 's uh oh that sounds nice 
ah i 've i 've got one at home too 
it 's a three eighty six thirty three megahertz forty four meg ra- ram and hundred and thirty meg drive and super vga 
and yeah it 's fun 
i do programming too 
my job is uh edp auditor 
and so i 'm into computers all the time 
edp 
electronic data processing 
okay 
that sounds like a fine job 
yeah 
i really enjoy it 
and it treats me well 
yes 
uh what are you studying in college computers 
ah 
computer engineering 
how nice 
well it 's computer engineering technology uh which uh it 's all i can understand is just this slightly more hands on version of computer engineering 
but i 've got a ways to go yet 
so far most of what i 've done is getting gotten core classes out of the way taken some electronics classes and one class in um with computer logic 
how they work is fascinating to me 
oh yes 
yeah i rather enjoy it myself 
the uh lab for that uh um computer logic class was a lot of fun 
was it 
di- y- 
yeah 
we got to hook up a few uh counters and and uh de- encoders 
hardware stuff huh 
yeah 
what do you think of that fuzzy logic 
i 've not gotten a chance to work with it although um m- uh -y data structures teacher was telling us something about wh- how fuzzy fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it 
uh-huh 
now how you 'd implement that uh software wise or mechanically i do n't know 
but uh it sounds like a very impressive piece of piece of work 
yeah 
they 're pretty amazing 
uh i 've written a couple of programs for commercially uh and it 's a fun field 
yes 
in the fuzzy logic direction 
wha- 
no 
in uh 
no 
just regular uh 
but you have to take into account you know with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you uh to make your program crash or things you normally do n't consider 
yeah 
entering bad information of one sort or another 
and 
yeah 
pushing c- keys certain times and messing up your files and things like that 
yeah 
uh-huh 
and your going to be an engineer a computer engineer type 
uh yeah 
well th- what the computer well the cet program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from 
you get programming a f- fair amount of programming 
you get uh hardware 
you get uh more or less uh you get basic electronics courses that uh deal with you know not only the digital circuitry but uh you know power supplies and and uh just the whole gamut but mostly towards uh computer electronics 
so the idea is that um you can go in a variety of directions from cet major 
but i s- i have more fun with the hardware than i do with the software 
so you 
know i pretty much plan on i mean so far i 'm planning to go in the engineering direction 
i do n't 
that 's good uh 
what vacations have you been on that you like 
um well i really enjoyed um 
i went to mackinaw island a few years back 
right 
it 's in the middle o- lake michigan 
and so that was nice 
uh-huh 
i like um driving to a different cities because of the scenery 
so that was nice 
so y- 
mostly yours is kind of driving 
and 
yeah 
we 've i 've been all over the states except for pretty much east 
um it 's very pretty driving like um up north in wisconsin too 
um how how far uh do you usually en- end up driving just 
um the furthest i drove was probably texas 
and then i 've taken a train before to california 
now where you 're from where oh wisconsin 
kenosha wisconsin 
um-hum 
okay 
yeah 
i have a brother in minnesota that used to live in wisconsin 
oh 
so yeah 
that 's quite a ways 
yeah 
it is 
i 've uh 
we went to california this last year and uh liked it 
um-hum 
but it was too crowded walt disney world and all those places it 's just the wrong time of the year to go 
oh 
oh yeah 
and uh course uh you get in any of those tourist traps and everything 's uh outrageously priced 
um-hum 
and uh kind of 
you wonder if they 're it 's really worth it to pay uh thirty five dollars or forty dollars just to get in 
yeah that 's true 
but there 's lots of fun places to see um 
i think the scenery kind of 
that 's something do to you like to get up in mountains 
or 
oh yeah 
um-hum 
do you have any mountains nearby 
no 
it 's pretty flat is n't it 
yeah 
yeah 
um i think uh the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money is n't it 
oh yeah 
yeah 
what vacation have you enjoyed the most 
um probably uh when we go to wisconsin dells 
um it 's pretty fun 
there 's a lot to do up there 
it 's pretty busy though 
you have to like crowds you know 
what is it 
i um oh it 's uh like a huge amusement park um they have water slides and it 's just a big big tourist attraction 
okay 
uh-huh 
there 's the downtown is all like little shops and candy shops 
and it 's it 's really neat 
i do n't think uh hardly anybody lives there 
because it 's just kind of like you know tourists 
probably a city in itself kind of like huh 
yeah 
it 's mostly a a summer summer place 
summer place 
how far away is it 
um from kenosha it 's about three hours 
huh 
it 's about a hour away from madison 
okay 
sure 
yeah 
so that 's nice 
sure 
it 's it 's pretty ride up there too 
i really like the city wausau in wisconsin 
it 's really pretty 
it 's nice out there 
i- i like all the nature things there are to look at you know 
right 
well and you could probably 
you 're in a climate that 's kind of humid 
so you have probably a lot of green and a lot of real pretty things 
our our climate 's real dry and you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery 
where is that 
most of the most most the land 's pretty brown 
you do n't have as much of the greenery like you have 
oh 
where is that 
uh idaho is where i live 
and uh 
yes 
i do n't twenty five oh okay 
it 's by uh 
i have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that i 'm on the phone 
it 's by um boise 
you ever heard of boise 
oh yeah 
yeah 
and uh it 's fun 
it 's nice 
it 's uh it 's lot different kind of 
i lived in indiana for a while 
and it 's a real different uh land and scenery than there 
it 's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and things like that 
yeah 
i think uh there 's a lot of places uh oh down even in southern utah the canyons canyon lands and bryce canyon 
and oh boy they 're gorgeous lake tahoe those are kind of fun places 
oh do that yeah 
we usually go over to bear lake in the summer which is uh kind of on the border of idaho and utah 
and the lake goes on forever 
and that 's real pretty over there too 
oh 
but i think i 'm kind of a summer vacationer 
yeah i do oh yeah 
me too uh 
me too 
unless i 'm going somewhere warm for the winter 
right 
right 
yeah 
that 'd be nice 
when 'd you try and 
will i return anything 
well really the only things that i have returned have not been faulty 
it 's been because of the size or some problem like that 
right 
i really have n't had to return things because they did n't perform the way they were supposed to 
most the time they have a pretty good guarantee 
uh 
only thing i 've had lately is uh my kids got all these barbie kind of toys for uh christmas 
and uh i- it takes them less than a day 
and they 're broken in one way or another 
but i do n't know if that 's just kids or if that 's uh 
maybe those type of parts sh- should be for older kids 
um-hum 
what age are your children 
i have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them 
um-hum 
and uh i do n't think they 're unduly rough 
but maybe they are 
i do n't know 
but uh a lot of the little barbie sets they come with real little pieces 
and they 're easily lost and easily broken 
but 
i- um-hum 
well my daughter is twenty one now 
so it 's been a while since we 've had barbie things 
but you know it 's been a while since they 've uh gone through the barbie st- 
but we did have barbies we did have barbies and things 
and there 
seems to me that that became a craze when she was already oh like you know third fourth fifth grade 
doll stage huh right 
so she was n't in it for very long before she was out of it 
but uh i do n't remember her breaking a lot of stuff 
do n't remember her breaking the 
no 
i do n't 
but i also do n't remember lots of little pieces 
they 've got so many different things with it now 
right well that 's one thing they 've got 
they 've got every type of imaginable 
camping on the beach and all of these come with oh like l- tiny tiny little plates and little sunglasses 
and uh my three and a half year old has wanted this ken doll 
goodness 
and so i finally got her a ken doll 
and uh less than a week later the arm was broken 
oh dear 
but they were real good about replacing it 
that 's one nice thing is they 're real good about replacing it 
well uh i guess if they 'll replace them then they assume they should n't have broken 
right 
well the the you know those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way 
and she 's not that strong that i would she 's not that big of a girl that i think could really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could you know 
any direction 
um um-hum 
right 
yeah 
the main thing that they 've they had when my daughter was playing with barbies wa- just clothes 
yes 
you know that was about it 
that was about it 
um-hum 
and the barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff 
but 
and the main thing my kids are seem to be into nowadays are electronics 
my my children are twenty one and twenty five and twenty eight 
oh is that right 
um-hum 
and 
well do you see that there 's a little big problem with electronic things 
s- no 
not really 
we uh have n't had that much you know problem with things that we have bought 
they seem to to last 
in fact when they offer us extended warranties we we do n't buy them because we 've we do- we find we do n't need them 
do n't buy them because you do n't need them 
yes 
and uh it seems like it 's just a an added tack on 
plus a lot of their credit cards now you know will guarantee 
if you purchase on your credit card you know then they e- put an extended warranty on it if it does n't work a- and uh or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time 
oh yes 
so it seems like it 's a waste of money 
that 's the way yes 
well you almost assume if you 're going to have problems with it it 's usually be- before that warranty would expire 
any 
the first one 
um-hum 
and like i 've even bought on a recliner once i bought you know a a an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that 
and i never used it 
you never ever even needed it 
and so th- it seems ridiculous 
and like washers and dryers and things like that i 've never had one go out 
in fact they usually 
when they do go out it 's either something my husband can buy the part and fix 
and we do n't even have a repairman come 
or it means it 's old enough that it 's time to replace the whole thing 
it 's time to replace it 
um-hum 
yes 
so i mean 
i- i think these extended warranties are gimmicks really 
they 're i do too 
a lot of it 
we bought when we first married we bought one on our tv 
and that there was it was a five year after the first five years 
and that was ridiculous 
um-hum 
and they charge you a pretty good price for them too 
yes 
they 're a pretty healthy price 
and you 're trying to think oh maybe i 'll need this 
you never you always think gosh if i say no then i wo n't you know 
um-hum 
but 
well my husband finally just put his foot down 
i do n't know 
and he said we 're not going to buy any of these anymore 
and if it goes out well you know 
if you probably got your ti- worth out of it anyway 
um-hum 
and uh so uh we really have been fairly happy with with things 
but now we take good care of things 
and we do n't um run out and buy a lot of of things either 
and since our kids are n't little anymore i 'm not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken 
yes 
the little 
well you probably are real careful of the brands you buy 
and the when you do buy things you probably watch what kind of type of 
well you look at the consumer guide 
quality yes 
and uh you go around 
and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the 
um what sort of camping do you like to do the most 
uh well i i do uh real rough type camping 
i have a motor home 
huh rough type huh 
yeah 
okay 
uh 
oh yeah 
motor homes can be a lot of fun 
yeah 
they really are 
yeah 
they really are 
i 've i 've enjoyed it 
i 've never actually done any uh like tent camping 
but uh one of these days i 'm going to try that too yeah like to go to vi- to the national parks and state parks and and uh just get out and see nature 
uh that can be a lot of fun too 
yeah 
how about you 
well so far my wife and i have pretty much had to stick with tent camping 
uh-huh 
this summer we went to uh the smokey mountain national park and uh stayed about three or four days in there 
oh how great 
it was wonderful 
oh yeah 
nights were cool enough to where they 're comfortable 
um 
and the the days were nice and warm 
and it was beautiful beautiful few days 
uh-huh 
that 's great 
it worked out particularly well especially considering she was what six months pregnant 
uh-huh 
so i do n't know 
it worked pretty well 
it was one of those uh those dome type pop up tents 
um-hum 
um-hum 
nice and quick and easy to put up 
yeah 
and packs away nice and small 
yeah about had to be something like that getting around in a pinto 
well that 's true 
that 's true 
it was a lot of fun 
yeah i guess the last real uh camping trip i took was has been a couple years ago 
yeah 
uh i went to california and up to the sequoias 
ah 
that 's got to be beautiful territory 
yeah 
it 's gorgeous 
i love the big trees 
just just the drive up through um up the coast line and then cut over in into the into the parks it 's gorgeous though 
yeah 
what like sequoia national park 
um-hum 
yeah uh 
um-hum 
yeah 
i had been there before when i lived in california 
that 's my first trip back in oh goodness hm hm thirty years maybe 
yeah 
but that is god 's country 
it has to be 
yeah 
yep 
do they still have the uh the scenic uh roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees 
uh n- no 
they do n't 
that 
and the last one um an- well 
the first time i was there the the tree was still standing 
but it has since come down 
oh okay 
yeah 
but they are huge 
if you 've never seen them it 's it 's very awe inspiring 
no 
so far new orleans is far west as i 've gotten well new orleans and uh minneapolis 
um-hum 
yeah um-hum 
well there 's lots of pretty country further west 
oh yeah 
yeah 
we 're hoping one of these days soon after we 're out of school to head that way 
yeah 
yeah 
and needed need to take the little one show them all the all the pretties before they go away 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
they seem to be trailing out quickly 
yeah 
because of th- there 's lots to see 
there 's of course the the grand canyon 
and uh the painted desert is is real pretty in a in a different sort of way 
yes 
and course the the sequoias and the redwoods and and you get up into bryce canyon and yellowstone 
and uh the grand tetons are gorgeous too 
i imagine 
yeah 
i would imagine they are 
course i 'm i guess i 'm partial to big tree country 
yeah 
i do n't know why i got stuck down here in texas 
i think it 's called a job 
i do n't know 
uh not a whole lot of forestry down there is there 
no 
not around here 
oh 
not around here 
the place is forested with c- with those concrete trees 
hm um-hum 
lot lot of concrete and glass you know 
yeah 
well i guess that 's god 's place too 
anyway 
hm yeah 
um what do you figure has been the longest trip you 've taken camping 
uh probably the the last one that i went to california 
i took uh three weeks 
three weeks 
so i was actually yeah on the road a little more than three weeks 
yeah 
the whole family in with in on this 
um-hum 
everybody 
yeah 
yep 
that would have to be a blast 
yeah 
it really was it was great 
what 
well you went out from texas up in into that area 
um-hum 
yeah 
we went uh we took the southern route and went went through uh uh the grand canyon again 
and we stopped at uh um las vegas for a couple of nights and then uh went into malibu in california over on the coast 
yeah 
and then went up the the big sur highway all the way up to san francisco and uh could n't even cut across through the wine country and went down to the to uh sequoia national park 
okay 
oh wow 
okay 
big sur highway that 's uh well you 're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time are n't you 
oh yeah uh-huh you really are 
uh well uh the cowboys are my favorite team 
that 's pretty easy to say nowadays 
lot easier than it was a couple years ago 
but they had a big win today 
uh did you get to watch it 
no 
i did n't 
i uh have been at my computer all day 
so 
oh 
are you a cowboy fan 
well i used to be a real big cowboy 's fan 
and and uh i 'm not a- jimmy johnson 's fan 
being an okie i just really do n't care much uh 
right 
yeah 
it 's it 's kind of hard not to be a cowboy fan though 
uh-huh 
they 've always been you know my favorite 
right 
but uh and and i guess i still have a soft spot 
yet 
i just hate that that 's the coach that 's leading them 
right 
right 
so now have they 
they 're in the play-offs right 
yeah 
they made it to the play-offs finally 
like just you know two years ago they were one and fifteen 
they won like just one game 
and so it 's a pretty fast turn around 
but this year they made it to play-offs 
and today was their first game 
and they beat the chicago bears 
so everybody 's really going crazy you know down here 
i 'll bet they are 
they 're going crazy 
so so they turned it around 
but yeah they have a lot of young exciting players now up 
i mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired tom landry 
but you know now it 's like you know they 're doing good so everybody 's forgotten about that 
uh a- football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world 
uh-huh 
hit a bad season 
and it 's you know the coach 's fault 
let 's let 's dump him 
right 
first good season the coach can do no wrong 
right 
exactly 
but they 've dallas has always been good ahead you know heading good players and and both running running backs and and defense 
you know 
um-hum 
right 
yeah 
uh you know they have a young team 
it 's you know a lot different than the teams they used to have where it 's the same old you know players every year and you know same coach same everything 
so now it 's you know like a taste of something different 
they 're all not you know mister nice guys like they used to be 
now it 's like you know tough and dirty team 
so everybody is really excited 
and 
who 's their competition going to be 
well it 's supposed to be the redskins but you know we beat them already 
we beat them this year in in washington 
so you know so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the super bowl 
but you know it 's just that we have to play every game away you know 
it 's going to be tough 
but but ever- 
their competition i- are teams that they 've already beat this year 
so i mean atlanta they 're in it too 
and we beat them 
and uh see detroit we play them next week 
but you know we should beat them 
everybody feels like we should be able to beat them 
so it 's so everything is uh looking real good 
course i think you know you can n't really go by what happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they 've had injuries that heal 
um-hum 
right 
and you know it can be a tot- or injuries that uh have newly happened and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one you played 
right 
right 
yeah 
well the cowboys are on a roll 
they 've won like i think six or seven in a row now 
so they 're supposed to be the hottest team in the in the league going into the play-offs 
so 
we- well since you have a ou uh drop out as a quarterback 
uh right 
yeah 
troy aikman 
he got hurt at ou 
so he transferred to ucla 
well he he really did n't feel like he 'd be able to do a lot of passing at ou 
right 
ou 's always been known for their running game 
um-hum 
more than 
they 're playing tonight in fact 
right 
i 'm watching them on tv right now 
but they 're doing some stomping on virginia 
oh i tell you 
they 've they 've not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts 
really 
well they 're doing good tonight 
are they 
yeah they 're winning they 're winning forty one to seven 
i have n't been watching 
well good for us 
yeah 
right 
oh 
but yeah 
and uh that 's right 
aikman did go to ou 
i forgot about that 
yep 
they ha- 
then he went out to let 's see southern cal 
is that where you went 
yeah 
uh ucla 
yeah 
yeah 
so 
but the cowboys did good today 
i mean i was proud 
i thought i thought they would get beat today because i mean they 're so young you know 
play-offs 
uh are you presently looking uh for a u- used car 
well as a matter of fact i just bought one 
just bought one 
just just within the last three weeks 
so 
what 'd you get 
i got a lexus ls four hundred which is made by toyota 
lexus 
um 
okay 
lexus is a toyota sub brand 
yeah 
okay 
it 's kind of their 
i was wondering where that came from 
because they 're talking like it was an american built car 
right 
it it sounds like it but it really is n't 
yeah 
it 's uh marketed of course it its own dealerships 
yeah 
u- usually or somebody that 's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership uh sometimes they do that 
yeah 
but it 's uh a brand car 
yeah 
but i 've really liked it 
it it drives just wonderfully 
and there is 
it 's so quiet y- almost can n't tell the engine is running 
that 's their big selling point uh other than general luxury 
and an- but the particular seems to be the uh the quiet ride 
it really is 
it 's got pretty good acceleration too 
seem they it 's yeah 
it 's got a cd player in it 
so i can i can play those 
and 
uh was 
that was n't a standard feature was it 
hum-um 
okay 
but there 's not very many options on that car 
uh 
yeah there 's only about five or six options 
everything else is standard 
i get the impr- yeah 
you get the impression that 's 
uh some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north the cd and the premium sound system 
um-hum 
y- skidding control 
you mean the antilock brake system 
yeah 
it 's kind of a traction control i think they call it 
yeah 
it 's it 's not just antilock brake 
i think that 's already on most of them 
but there 's a further traction control uh 
oh 
this is a uh uh probably suspension tied into the brakes 
yeah 
and and also the suspension can be raised for driving like in the ice and snow 
it can raise the car 's center up a little bit for going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in michigan or somewhere 
oh 
yeah 
yeah 
uh shoot some of these muddy driveways use it around here 
mississippi probably does n't mississippi probably does n't have to worry too much 
no 
snow does n't happen very often 
if it does people go what 's this stuff 
yeah 
uh originally i 'm from west virginia 
uh we got a pretty fair amount of snow 
oh 
well you had some there 
yeah 
but uh i got down here in june of eighty four 
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they 'd seen in twenty years 
and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane manly adult men into playful little children 
oh i know 
we had this group of uh surveyors come into uh a shop i was working in um four or five of them these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place 
they had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked 
while they were there they set back drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place had themselves a ball for about an hour 
oh no 
well the uh the lexus uh really 
and the moon roof i think is also an option 
yeah 
although most of them are ordered them with it 
but there really is only about a half a dozen uh things 
and everything else is pretty standard 
yeah 
i did not get the traction control which also when you take the c- traction control and the and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats too 
oh 
so that 's kind of 
you go out and get in that real cold car and you turn that on 
it 's a package deal 
and it yeah and it kind of uh 
but that 's only available if with the traction control and the other option 
yeah 
and those two are sold together 
so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to to uh do it 
ouch 
so i i opted not for that 
but and uh the dealership i dealt with they order them all with the uh moon roof and uh you know nice floor mats and everything in there 
no 
it does n't sound real necessary in texas 
yeah 
yeah 
i worked for lincoln 
so the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a cd or not in the stereo system 
and that was pretty much it 
and they had like three or four basic packages that they they offer 
yeah 
sounds like the lincoln mercury dealer i used to work for 
they did n't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got 
little mercury tracer imagine or not they make a they make a luxury mercury tracer 
yeah 
i 've been o- 
i 've been 
yeah 
i 've seen that in the dealership 
i was driving a lincoln a mark seven for the last four years before i traded it for this 
yes 
and uh i 'm leasing the lexus 
i usually lease them since i own a business 
yeah 
i just run it through my business 
but but it 
um-hum 
the lincoln ride is certainly good too but the this lexus is nothing like i have ever been in before 
it just 
like sitting in your living room 
yeah 
it really is 
and it 's got a lumbar support in the seats 
adjustable 
adjustable uh power 
yeah 
and just kind of brings that support up in the sma- 
so w- 
hi 
well what do you think 
well providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task 
and i uh personally i do n't approve of it for two reasons 
number one is that i think that uh the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now 
and if they were to administer this they would uh get us more and more into debt further than we can ever get out ourselves 
number two i think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would would be dried up 
and really no one would be would only answer to to the government to a big bur- bureaucratic mess 
and uh i 've seen what it has done in other countries 
and so i do n't think uh i do n't think we should head in that direction 
although that we have problems right now 
and i do agree that they exist 
because health care insurance for for everyone is skyrocketing 
and it 's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore 
um-hum 
how do you feel about the wh- whole ordeal 
well i agree that it 's a big task 
but i think that i think that the us should move towards some kind of national health care plan at least as a long term kind of goal 
um-hum 
you know possibly you know just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing 
but i think that ultimately it would be a good idea to um 
and not have a completely socialized medical system in the country but maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now 
uh-huh 
okay 
it um just because it seems that um health insurance costs are sky rocketing well as fast as the national deficit perhaps 
oh yes 
and so that 's 
and that 's a that 's a vicious cycle of course 
but what what you 're think 
yeah 
so what you 're saying though is instead of having the national govern- government administer giving health insurance to every man woman and child with throughout the whole company you see more of them as regulating the high costs uh that people are forced to pay for it right now 
because 
is that is that correct 
um 
or do you think that 
well i um well i would n't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately 
i do n't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea 
and um 
well with the with the costs as they are right now do you think that the government uh 
because what that would require is for us to pay uh more taxes 
and the the in- the people that can afford taxes the middle income and the upper income will be paying more ca- taxes to to pay for health insurance for everyone whereas right now the the public themselves get health insurance 
right 
and they provide their own health insurance 
the well as it is now the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they 're the only people that can afford health insurance 
and so that the other people have no health insurance 
and you know they 'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies 
and somebody winds up paying for that 
and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance 
so i do not see that anything this situation would get any worse 
that way it might get better 
you think it might b- get better huh 
i i kind of disagree 
um-hum 
the reason being is uh we have 
i do n't know 
i guess it 's my my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic rules that it would take to administer it 
um-hum 
and um the the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and and uh do n't allow cases where they might throw them out of business whereas the federal government if they took over everything they would n't care because they 'll never go out of business 
people would still have to pay taxes 
the money would have to come from somewhere 
and so you 'd s- 
i i feel that the cost would increase dramatically also 
but in the same sense the the care and the the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical uh field would would diminish 
um-hum 
um i 
yeah 
well i thin- 
okay 
uh so what do you think about the school system 
okay well i think they 're they 're having a lot of trouble right now 
i know my son goes to a private school 
but uh i think they 're big city public schools by definition are having a a tough time right now just from uh probably from budget cuts and and everything else going on 
uh wh- why did you choose a private school 
well i had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to m- be moved in public school 
so he 's he has been going to private since kindergarten 
public school 
oh has he 
so 
and how does he like it 
oh he 's loved it 
he 's a senior in high school this year 
so he 's 
so he 's been there all time 
yeah 
he 's done it the whole twelve and a so many years 
and it 's been uh it 's been really good for him 
how big of a school is it 
uh overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper school upper four grades uh about four hundred and something 
so it 's maybe a hundred per grade 
a hundred per grade that 's a good size 
yeah 
it really is 
kind of gives them the you know 
like get a little leery of the real small ones that they do n't get much interaction with kids 
but uh 
yeah 
that was we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture 
and he 's done he 's done really well 
so they do n't 
that 's good 
and just he was just ahead at an early age 
and i did n't feel like uh in what was available particularly in the first three grades and even in the fourth grade when they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program 
um-hum 
huh 
and i just did n't think that was going to get it 
i thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead uh everyday but yet still be with his peers age wise 
right 
still enjoy the 
right 
um one thing i think i 've noticed is uh m- my oldest is in kindergarten 
so i 'm in a little different ballgame 
you 're just getting started 
i 'm just starting i 
but uh seems to me that uh kids these days uh can really get away with murder 
and the teachers do n't have as much are n't respected as much 
and uh they have to be some careful of the things they do and say 
yeah 
i know 
that 's that 's a big problem 
and uh makes me a little nervous that uh students do n't seem to show that respect 
and 
we would n't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school 
no 
heavens 
no 
would n't have thought of it 
and you know and they 'll stand there now with them toe to toe 
no 
you would n't 
and 
and uh the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what i understand uh 
i think that 's wrong 
i think we need to get back to the show some respect 
and course i guess the teacher used to warrant that 
but 
yeah 
but a lot of times it 's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for elders and adults particularly in in responsible positions have not uh i do n't think it 's had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases 
right 
for other people and 
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands 
well how do you think that 's happened 
you think our society 's just uh stopped talking out 
or this uh generation 's just kind of changed a little bit uh 
i guess i 
well the world changes 
so i mean obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be 
right 
i mean they 're exposed to a whole lot more things 
they have a whole lot more uh variety of things that they 're that they see and do at an earlier age 
so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time 
but but still i think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to to teach uh basic values and basic uh respectful of uh -ness of authority 
right 
and i just do n't think that this does n't always get emphasized anymore uh 
that just is n't coming through is it 
no 
i mean i remember uh well it was a big thing when they let girls wear levi 's 
we used to have to wear dresses and then you had to uh go to dresses 
yeah 
had to wear dresses did n't you 
they had to be a pantsuit 
and it was polyester 
and it had to be matching 
and 
and when it was skirts it was like get down on the floor 
and we hold the ruler up here and it 's no more than so many inches above the knee 
yes 
exactly 
yes 
because it was mini skirt time back there at one time 
yes 
so it 's really changed 
it 's uh really kind of gone the rounds 
so i th- think that maybe that 's effected it to some degree 
they say you kind of act how you 're dressed a little bit 
so i 
yeah 
i think that probably does have have something to do with it 
that it 's also 
do uh d- does this school your son goes to do they uh re- required to wear a uniform 
or 
no 
they do not do uniforms although one 's where he was between like second and eighth grade did 
uh-huh 
yeah 
there are quite a few of your s- 
brian in plano texas 
how are you doing today 
hi 
fine 
i 'm nancy 
how are you 
great nancy 
i 'm in plano also 
you 're in plano also uh 
yes 
we 're not too long distance today 
well good to hear 
i was just talking to someone the other day from pennsylvania 
oh that was good 
utah i 've had a couple of 
but that was it 
really 
yeah 
all right 
well good to hear 
good to hear 
learned about their basketball team 
which one 
uh jazz 
oh yeah 
yeah 
the utah jazz 
yeah 
yeah 
they 're they 're pretty good 
they got some good good some good uh good players out there 
that 's what i heard 
yeah 
yeah 
well you ready for new year 's eve 
i am 
good 
should we uh start this so we can 
okay 
what was your name again 
nancy 
nancy 
that 's right 
right 
and i 'm brian 
right 
just a moment 
okay nancy the i guess the today 's subject is benefits in a job other than salary 
right 
what uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as as crucial benefits 
uh-huh 
well i 'm a little different than other people because i do n't have benefits with my job 
uh-huh 
i 'm a nurse 
and i work 
oh 
i float so that i have no benefits except higher pay for doing that 
uh-huh 
right 
uh-huh 
so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance 
and i- i make enough money by the hour to make up for that 
to to compensate for some of the benefits 
right 
uh-huh 
oh 
yeah 
it 's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace 
yes 
and then i have my freedom 
i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do 
well -at 's that 's an excellent 
so actually that is a benefit uh 
well it is to me 
most people prefer the security of nine to five and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement 
yeah 
and i 'm just really not interested in all that 
right 
right 
well i guess that 's a good point uh 
uh-huh 
i do belong to a a large corporation 
or my that where i 'm currently employed 
and there 's uh there 's some different things uh 
one that you 've already mentioned is is health insurance 
i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i was n't employed with a large corporation 
right 
and that got to be somewhat expensive 
and so i- i think one of the benefits i- i see is the uh is the group uh group discount 
yeah 
right 
and especially if you have a family 
yeah 
then i think it makes a big difference 
-nd yes 
and that 's that 's one thing i do have 
yeah 
if i did n't have a family i do n't think i would have as as a male or as a as an individual of in this stage of my life i do n't think i would have insurance uh other 
right 
i do n't think i would go through that expense 
one other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours 
and in my previous job i really enjoyed because they had what was called a flex schedule where i could go and i could work uh nine hour days and have like friday only work four hours or i could do uh work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a f- you know three w- day weekend and make uh make my job flexible in that case 
oh yeah 
right 
could you change that as you felt like it 
or did you have to do it the same every week 
well basically yeah 
i had to do that uh the same uh for about every quarter of the year 
i mean uh because i was in a in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that uh i needed to make my schedule uh so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel 
uh-huh 
so so i- i think that uh that was a that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed 
um-hum yeah 
and i do n't c- have that in my current operation 
but uh you mentioned uh flexible work schedule 
and that 's that 's good 
yeah 
and uh what other benefits do you think are important 
oh well i guess retirement that kind of thing which i do n't worry much about 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
i just prefer to worry about today 
and probably not a practical attitude 
but that 's who i am 
so 
well and that 's an individual thing 
um-hum 
yeah 
with uh with our current uh organization we do have a nice retirement package 
and also a a nice thing that that we have in our corporation is a uh is a profit sharing plan where we can uh participate in the the profits of the company if we 're you know if we 've been there a while and we 're vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the company that we can uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times 
right 
and uh also uh in one of my wife 's uh companies where she worked they 'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that that eff- they made a cer- 
okay 
i guess tonight 's subject is uh woodworking 
what kind of woodworking do you do 
do you uh 
well ki- kind of mainly the woodworking i 've done lately is uh made like uh for example a little nativity scene um not the uh the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and and some odd stuff around the house 
uh-huh 
and so i i enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking 
and i do it out of hobby more than uh um you know something i have to do 
how about yourself 
uh w- well i- yeah i like to think of it as a hobby but i i guess also partly out of necessity just repairing things around the house 
um a few years ago uh w- we needed uh they needed some book shelves 
and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves 
and um uh i- it actually worked pretty well 
and over the years i 've i 've refined those plans 
i got myself a router 
and i 'm i 'm very good at making book shelves 
uh-huh 
it it 's also a way of relieving stress 
my wife kind of laughs at me that anytime i get stressed i just go out in the garage and we 've got more book shelves 
well i 'll have to come and see them 
that sounds like a good idea 
i you know 
and that 's that is right 
it is out of necessity 
because a lot of the things that uh well we can n't be able to afford 
but also i i s- sometimes think that uh i enjoy doing that 
and i like to get out and and uh to work with my hands 
and uh sounds like you got some real nice tools too 
do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools 
but uh well yeah 
i mean little by little i i started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things 
um-hum 
uh gotten a a good belt sander 
and and the router uh helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router 
um-hum 
the latest project that i 've been working on an- and this has kind of been sitting here for a few months is a a cabinet to to put a tv in 
oh a entertainment type center 
right 
oh 
and it that 's works well because you can design it to to suit whatever equipments you have 
so i designed a space just the right size for the tv and then th- the the vcr and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment 
right 
right 
right 
and uh that 's worked pretty well 
uh with uh with the router you can make nice uh 
i guess dado joints is what it 's called 
right 
or yes 
i 
yeah 
i 'm aware of that 
um and it 's uh 
and also with a router you can uh make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge and uh and uh casings and so forth that are that are real nice 
that 's right 
that 's right 
so 
so that that 's good 
that 's good 
what i- what i need next is a good table saw 
yeah 
and i i debate whether it the better if you get a uh just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws 
oh 
radial arm saws i guess what they 're called 
uh-huh 
um it it seems to me the radial arm saws is better 
well it it takes up less room 
yes 
i mean you you set the wood down 
and you move the saw 
yes 
whereas if you 're ripping wood you 're probably better off with a a table saw 
well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you would n't be able to do that 
um but uh yeah 
a table saw does take a lot of time excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment 
yeah 
and 
uh that that 's partly my problem now 
is i do n't have room for this 
i uh a 
we 're uh where we lived before up north uh basements were were common 
uh uh-huh 
and i could 've put all this stuff in my basement 
but not so here in texas 
yes uh-huh 
no 
they do n't have basements 
well i 'm from up north also 
and and uh no 
there 's no basements down here 
and it 's kind of uh hard to get uh shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that 
yeah 
yeah 
lot of the equipment too that i 've i 've used in the past uh i w- you know i 've used in school 
and uh i would 
i do n't know 
i 'd i 'd kind of like to to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make uh some pretty nice uh pieces of uh well wood for for different things for tables for for or um chairs for you know decks and so forth 
so i do n't know 
um-hum 
i i just enjoy woodworking 
and i think the the main thing is like you say it 's a it 's a good out 
it 's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day 
and it 's a great stress stress reliever 
have you ever used a lathe 
yes 
i have in school i have 
and i 've made uh uh different things uh lathe type tables for chairs 
and i 've made uh bowls 
and um and uh 
so uh what do you think about child care 
oh well my my feelings on are it is uh i would n't take a child to a day care you know 
right 
i mean i 'd i 'd wind up um 
just a babysitter in a home 
probably find someone 
how come you would n't take them to a day care 
u- um 
just because of the 
well too many kids and and i think too many infections and things coming in 
yeah 
they seem to pass a lot a 
yeah 
sicknesses and 
i do n't know 
then all the things you hear about them 
yeah 
you kind of wonder whether or not 
an- yeah 
i mean i 'm sure there 's some good ones 
but i just 
i do n't think that i would hum 
i took uh cammy to a oh 
it was a preschool day care type of thing 
oh uh-huh 
but i kind of i liked it in some ways 
and some ways i did n't 
um i think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important 
oh yeah 
yeah 
and 
how was it 
well i think they had a they had two teachers 
and i think there were twenty kids 
but i only had her going two days 
and most the other kids were going more days 
so that was probably my own fault that she did n't 
oh 
sh- she went 
oh you know one thing i noticed is uh um just they were trying to get her to teach her to write her name 
and uh i did n't notice it until this summer when i was working with her that she 'd bend her wrist all the way oh not in a natural sh- form 
oh she did 
yes 
and uh i was kind of m- mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or or uh tried to say look you 're holding your 
she 's holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff 
sh- but she was 
uh wrapping her arm all the way aroun- 
yes 
yeah 
and uh i had n't worked with her on writing at all at that point 
she was four or three 
yeah 
she was uh it was last year 
and uh then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on 
and i wor- 
like i said i did n't notice it till then because i had n't worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that 
oh 
uh-huh 
well they 'd never picked it out though 
no 
huh 
they never 
or just never said anything 
course like i said i took her two days a week 
and maybe that was 
my main reason for taking her was um just social skills more than anything else 
yeah 
yeah 
i felt she needed the s- 
just i did n't feel like she was mature enough socially and um 
yeah 
well one thing that 's kind of different too though a preschool than than taking a a infant under to a day care where they 're -ken care of 
um-hum 
oh yeah 
i think it would be hard to take them to people you do n't know 
preschool 's a different thing 
but i think it 's hard to take kids to somebody you do n't know and or unless you have awfully good references reliable um people 
yeah 
yeah 
i do n't know 
it 's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long 
well i think it 's hard to leave them 
it is 
it is 
the older ones it 's not 
you do n't even really have any real worries because you know that they 'll play with whoever 's there 
and they usually adapt pretty well 
yeah 
but uh 
yeah 
it it is i think just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will 
well and you know their kind of their schedules 
and you know if they 're upset and that type of a deal 
um yeah 
yeah 
i do n't know how um people uh that have young kids work and work full time and and do it really without being stressed out all the time 
i think it 's well 
i do n't know 
then then on the other hand i think it 's harder to stay home in some regards 
it 's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you 're doing something productive 
and at the end of the day your house still feels like it 's a mess 
and you have n't got anything done 
and what am i going to fix for supper 
oh yeah 
oh yeah 
that is 
yeah 
it 's kind of hard to always feel like gosh 
what 
i- is this important what i 'm doing 
and 
uh yeah 
well um the work never ends 
no 
for sure 
no 
it it does n't 
uh 
huh 
but i think that taking kids to a probably people that take them to uh preschools and day cares full time oh 
they would i do n't know probably just feel a different uh 
i think i just think it would be hard to do that full time 
i feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that 
are they driving the babysitter crazy 
and you know wha- 
uh uh-huh 
or is everything okay 
okay jerry 
-kay 
i guess uh tonight 's topic is about uh personal computers and level of interest and uh and your your expertise 
oops 
oh well 
oh well 
oh okay 
well let 's let 's fire away 
uh well bryan 
okay 
well first of all 
you want me to start off 
yeah 
why do n't you why do n't we why do n't you do about thirty seconds 
and i 'll do thirty seconds 
and then we can work off of there 
okay 
real real fine 
uh first of all uh yes uh i do own a pc here at home 
and i also have one at uh the office 
and my level of interest is quite high with pcs 
and i was really i am really interested in them however not to the extent as i was about uh two years ago when i basically knew about everything there was to know about different things 
and that was the time when we were shopping for one 
and i think we got a top of the line at that time 
but uh as you know pcs change quite rapidly 
and the technological advances kind of outdated our pc where i can get the same pc i got two years ago at the fraction of the cost 
and i also enjoy using ours at home 
and we u- used it for a a number of different things 
plus i get in a lot an awful lot of good use of the one at work where i work 
lot of uh analytical um testing reviews um lot of different things i use it at ho- at work 
so i enjoy pcs 
and they they make my life life and my work a lot easier 
how about yourself 
well uh since uh 
well i guess since this time last year i 've changed uh jobs within the firm i 'm with and uh i now am learning to be a sys admin on on not only pcs but uh pers- uh professional work stations as well 
um-hum 
wow 
all right 
and these are the big mamas ie sons uh hewlett packards uh absorb uh oh the big solburns and it so forth 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and uh h- 
and and uh we have uh two pc 's here 
we have uh an xt 
and then recently we we made a the command decision to go ahead and get uh the absolute top of the line because spouse is a uh programmer 
uh-huh 
and so we got one that that could do enough uh and you know hold three different os 's as far as dos uh unix and uh os ii 
oh yes 
oh yes 
so uh i i get to see all kinds of different applications 
sounds like you 're an expert at it too 
no 
no 
learning 
i 'm learning to i 'm learning to be uh one who knows what 's he 's doing but expert 
yes 
no 
oh wow well 
i frown on that that term because uh too many people s- you know uh misuse the word 
so i 'd rather say i 'm i i am continually learning 
but my area my my level of expertise is increasing almost daily 
well that 's great be- 
and uh yes 
i 've got a pc and a work station at work 
and i and we have two pc 's here at w- at home 
uh-huh 
right 
and the a lot of the the the new mama we 're uh 
i 've got aldus and uh micrographics on it as far as uh technical publishing 
and we do a a quite a bit of church work with ours 
great 
and uh 
we do an awful lot of that too with ours 
you know some 
i i i 've found that uh the more we do with it uh it seems 
the lord is pleased that we 're kind of 
this is this is part of giving back a portion of what he 's given to us 
so uh i do n't mind because seems like the more we do there 's there 's the more stuff that 's uh available that comes along and so forth 
oh yes 
and so uh rather than being niggardly a- and chintzy uh we 've just said you bet boss seeing as how he was the one that uh enabled us to get the money to buy the 486 
definitely agree with that 
uh-huh 
because the the top of the line we 've got 
well we 've got a compatible 
to eight meg of ram and and two two two hundred and eleven hard drives 
yes 
wow 
wow 
you got 
that 's a 486 processor too 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
wow 
huh like i said we bought a real steam steam burner uh mainly because of spouse 's unix because unix takes uh uh well four megs minimum of ram 
that 's 
yes 
yes 
has to su- you have to have that to support unix 
um-hum 
of ram 
and then uh it it it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive 
right 
so the next size up was a two hundred and eleven 
and so rather than just have one we went ahead and got two 
uh at some point in time i 'm going to do the mirroring uh experiment to where one disc mirrors the other for fault tolerance 
yes 
wow 
okay 
and uh oh speak speak of the angel she just walked in 
well good for her 
its ti stuff 
so uh uh 
you say she 's a programmer also 
yeah 
she 's she 's a squirrel for uh uh contractor out at american airlines 
uh-huh 
so right 
well great 
well she probably needs that kind of a powerful machine to do her work 
okay 
okay 
universal health insurance 
right 
um that 's right 
um well i think universal health insurance like national health like what canada has is that what you 're you 're thinking this subject is about 
what would we like to say 
i think 
um-hum 
i think that 's what the subject is about 
did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject 
in the dallas the morning times 
yeah 
i guess i did not 
uh the state of washington and the state of minnesota is uh going to begin testing a program a state funded program for citizens of those two states 
and there 's fourteen other uh states that are considering it least according to the article in the paper this morning 
i think it 's a trend this this that 's uh probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need 
it 's getting to a point that you have to have it 
you have to have some form of health insurance 
well it 's been interesting that we 
and extremely expensive though 
yes 
so we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will um say that they think that everyone has a right to health care 
um-hum 
and yet i do n't think we 've ever quite decided who 's really supposed to pay for it 
well that 's the thing you know 
uh unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are are paying for the people that do n't have health insurance 
and which is why people are talking about 
we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that 's more fair 
yeah 
i do n't think you um 
you have health insurance 
yes 
i do 
through your company 
uh through my company 
yes 
but i have been in a situation uh recently where i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year 
and my wife developed cancer 
and we did n't have any insurance 
oh my goodness 
and it was uh go to parkland type situation 
that must 've been horri- 
how was your care at parkland 
uh because it was a life threatening situation it was very good 
uh as i- as it turned out one of the top um people or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at parkland 
but camp parkland is not free either 
no 
it 's not free 
but uh it 's it 's a situation that because i did n't have any insurance and i was on unemployment it was paid by the county 
is it affordable 
so you did have a good experience 
i had a bad experience as it turned out 
um i was fortunate that there was parkland 
is your wife better i hope 
uh no she passed away 
i 'm real sorry 
oh that 's all right 
sure 
that happens 
it does happen 
but it 's very sad 
yeah 
but in any event um i 'm in favor of national health if i had to vote for it 
well so am i 
actually um i 'm a pediatrician and i feel very strongly about um children and um developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year where we certainly proved that we 're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most 
oh is that right 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so um i 'm really quite active in trying to uh uh be proactive at least to for children 's issues 
it 's very complex very complicated 
but um i just strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids basic health benefits 
well i when i grew up and 
i grew up in south central kansas um 
we had 
and my mom worked for the health department the county health department 
and we had x rays every year 
we had a dentist come to our school and uh check our teeth once a year at least 
um we had all our flu shots taken care of our measles mumps rubella and all that other stuff 
um 
and uh when my children were growing up we did n't have that 
we had to pay for it which i was n't opposed to paying for it 
i had the money to pay for it 
but i 'm sure that there were people that do n't 
-ell and the costs of so much has gone up so much 
the cost of immunizations for example um and just the legal the legal benefits um 
that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily et cetera 
um-hum 
so well i do n't know 
it 's it is interesting 
in case you did n't know texas leads the nation in uninsured children 
thirty one percent of all texas children do not have insurance and are not on medicaid 
did not know that 
so uh one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care 
and i work in the children 's parkland system 
and it 's pretty overwhelming to me 
um-hum 
but um it 's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in dallas county 
set 
okay 
you you got the topic right 
yeah 
okay 
um well where in dallas are you 
i 'm in richardson 
oh okay 
so you do re- do recycling there 
yeah 
richardson has um well they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly if it 's not raining 
okay um-hum 
and they also have a couple of areas where you can take uh cans plastic and paper to uh you know dump them off there if you do n't uh want to wait and have a pick up least of paper 
but they do n't pick up the other items 
they do n't pick up cans or the plastic 
um-hum 
are they going to later 
or do you know 
i 'm not sure 
they only started to do the newspaper uh late last year just try like a trial basis 
uh-huh 
and see how it goes 
so i do n't know if they 're going to pick up the other things 
hm 
what about you 
well i 'm i 'm in dallas proper in the city of dallas 
um-hum 
and i know they do have you know a pilot program going on 
but it 's not here 
um 
so they 're not picking up anything 
oh 
so i mean we we collect everything 
we 've got all these boxes in our garage for you know green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything 
where do you take them 
but um well there 's there 's a couple places 
unfortunately we can n't find a place that 'll take everything 
hm 
um there 's a lot of places to take like the plastic um shopping bags like most of the grocery stores 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and there 's a wal-mart nearby that takes almost everything 
i can n't remember what it is they do n't take 
hm 
and the library will take glass 
so we end up you know 
on the weekend we pack it all in the car 
and and as we go places we oh wait we can drop the glass off you know drop things off one at a time 
oh 
but um and it 's kind of disappointing 
i mean i would even be happy if they just had one you know one place where you could do everything 
you know it would still be more convenient than what we have now 
one of the people from my department i think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the dallas shelter 
hm 
i think that was closer to downtown 
where is that 
uh she 's not here anymore but uh yeah 
oh 
i 'm pretty far north 
i 'm not i 'm i 'm i 'm just i 'm north of addison actually 
oh 
so i 'm i 'm really i 'm s- i 'm in dallas but only technically 
yeah 
well sometimes we take our uh we we always keep our aluminum cans 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks 
yeah 
i 've seen those 
you do n't get too much money back 
i figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there 
yeah 
but normally i collect oh like three trash bags full and i take them over to that can bank 
yep 
and it 's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans in the can bank 
you do n't get too much money for them 
but 
uh-huh well you get something 
uh we used to do that 
yeah 
but again that 's another stop and it does n't take plastic bags and and all that sort of thing 
um-hum 
but um i think that you know i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is 
and so hopefully they 'll do it soon 
um-hum 
that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week where i grew up we only had one a week 
uh-huh 
and that was certainly sufficient 
so if they just do 
one of them will be trash 
and the alternate time would do recyclables 
that 'd be great 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
ah i 'm disappointed sometimes they 're not always consistent in picking up those papers you know 
i seem to put them out there on wednesday 
i hope they do um-hum 
and like sometimes they come by 
sometimes they do n't 
oh 
i 'm not really sure why they 're not always consistent in that 
hm 
but i could certainly have uh three bins out there for you know plastic and and tin and paper whatever they were going to uh separate into and and have them pick it up on on one of the two days per week 
right 
that would be easy 
yeah 
do you have to um sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that that sort of thing 
or do they take the whole thing 
you 're not supposed to have like the coupons in there 
oh okay 
um or you 're not supposed to put magazines in there and you can n't take newspapers 
um-hum 
now at work uh you know we have changed our recycling 
at first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle 
and not too long ago they finally decided if it 's anything that 's paper and tears you can throw it in there because at first they said yeah at first they said they said no telephone books 
let me guess you work at ti right 
so do i 
yeah 
you know that well that 's stupid 
and then they said no newspapers 
i 
well in the my department everybody gets the wall street journal 
know yeah 
there was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that was n't recyclable 
yeah 
so i thought that was pretty good to expand upon it and say 
well th- and they take cans now too which is great 
anything paper yeah 
i still put my cans in with the cans 
i th- i do n't want it with paper 
somehow it just seems weird to me 
well our department used to collect the cans anyway for the christmas tree project 
and in fact we got this past year we got all of our money for the christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year 
oh 
oh 
and it worked out really well 
well we had th- the one person who used to take things to the dallas shelter 
uh-huh 
i think that 's what that was called 
uh-huh 
she collected she used to collect from the whole department 
but she took them all down to that dallas shelter place 
um-hum uh-huh 
i wish i could remember that whole name of that place 
but it 's a charity for the benefit of this shelter 
um-hum 
uh yeah 
she u- she used to collect them from everybody in the department 
yeah 
she 'd go up and down with her little bag collecting from everybody 
yep 
yep 
because we would get it 
okay 
all set then 
uh what do you think about it 
uh i think it 's a real good concept 
uh drug testing procedures would have to be refined 
um-hum 
from what i 've seen on the news there 's a a a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in uh drug testing 
oh i did n't realize that 
yeah 
um there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their uh test 
but they did n't know for sure what it was 
but it was a drug 
so they got turned down 
and uh turns out it was a prescription or people getting somebody else 's blood test 
um-hum 
same sort of problem that happens sometimes with these some of these uh like aids tests and such 
okay 
um-hum 
yeah 
that 's right 
i have heard 
uh i do n't remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh a positive indication of drugs 
but there 's not really there were n't really any there 
yeah 
uh every now and then there 's an error 
and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated 
oh yeah 
yeah 
i i work here at texas instruments 
so uh we we do a let me think do we yeah everyone coming in 
i guess i did three years ago 
yeah 
everyone coming in uh goes through the drug testing procedure 
and they talk about it as a you know as as better for the country and better for the working conditions 
yeah um-hum 
uh if they uh they test for drugs 
yeah 
i i 'm i can n't even remember if we do random sampling anymore 
i know we did in the military 
but i do n't know if once your in they continue to do it 
yeah 
but i guess you 're always on call for it 
yeah 
i not very long ago worked for wal-mart and about a year and a half ago they instituted a uh a uh drug testing program uh well drug and alcohol testing program 
uh-huh 
it 's it 's not a random through the s- 
um-hum 
as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a a blood test um 
uh-huh in 
but and uh i think the big problem though is is they send these off to large labs and then they have thousands and thousands of the samples that uh going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up and things like that 
my 
uh-huh 
right 
so your big beef with it is the uh 
a 
is is it 's a good idea 
but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better 
potential for inaccuracy yeah 
or make sure it 's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever 
yeah 
i i i tend to agree with you david 
yeah 
yeah 
my brother uh my brother used to work for wal-mart 
and then i do n't know if he still does or what because i do n't know if sam 's is actually part of it 
but he you know is working at sam 's now 
yeah 
yeah 
sam 's is part of wal-mart 
okay 
yeah 
then he 's been working for the company for a while too 
yeah he enjoys 
yeah 
it good company um 
oh yeah 
you all uh have some 
his telling me about good profit sharing and all that 
the company i thought was a great place to work 
so 
um-hum 
it 's good news 
yeah 
they got to have had two or three years in with them then you start buying stock 
and you have a have a little taken out of your check each each payday to put against uh uh stock portfolio uh not portfolio just you know against wal-mart stock 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
but uh you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while 
yeah 
that 's what my brother was telling me 
that 's good good new- good deal 
well uh how long were we su- 
i have n't done this in a couple months 
how long were we supposed to discuss for 
uh you 're supposed to get five minutes 
okay 
we got a couple more minutes then i guess 
uh think what else i can say about that um 
um do you have any idea uh 
let 's see 
we- you were you were tested for drugs as you got into uh as as you got into ti 
right 
um everyone coming in gets goes through the drug test 
yeah 
uh now uh were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through 
or 
uh no 
well let me think about that 
yeah 
it was after i w- i had already been hired um 
oh okay 
yeah 
you get hired then you come in the first 
i 
seems to me i remember that uh i was hired came in and went through some orientation 
and i thought i 
boy i can n't remember 
that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test 
maybe it was during the interview 
i came up a couple times for an interview 
so it 's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened 
but uh i guess just like other companies other friends i 've been hearing about that have been moving around 
it 's it 's before 
they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment 
so i 'm sure that happened to me too 
yeah 
yeah 
what what about oh 
they just instituted it there at wal-mart so 
yeah 
they they it was after i was already working there 
and they were n't testing any of those that were already working 
right right yeah i was n't 
so 
what do you think 
well uh this is this is about drug testing right 
right 
well uh i 'm i 'm certainly under the uh uh the influence of the idea that that the government needs to have less control on what uh what the citizens do although i do see this as uh uh something that definitely needs to be taken care of 
whether that whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or in the g- or the hands of hands of the government is a you know a a different question i think as far as i 'm concerned 
uh in a in other words i am fa- in favor of drug contr- or or or drug testing 
um i was drug tested when i came to my job here at ti 
yet but but at the same time i do n't think uh that should be governed by by the government uh per se 
um-hum 
i think it should be b- more by the private institution 
how about you 
yeah 
i think they the corporations should uh do all that 
they should uh have drug screening before they hire an employee and uh anytime that an employee 
um-hum 
like if they 're coming to late work all the time and uh and if they if they 're especially if there 's not on the line or any kind of sensitive job where you know if they can if they made a mistake it would cost a lot of money or or people 's lives then they need to be watched carefully 
uh-huh 
yeah 
sure 
so 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i i agree with you 
i you know i would even think that um uh i could in theory take that alo- a you know a step further and say anybody in any job you know if the corporation felt like uh an- 
and this is why i mean uh drugs are the biggest problem i think to face america today 
i mean it 's what drives crime 
it 's what drives um uh any sort of of uh uh pain and discomfort in the world or in america i think it 's some- it 's somewhat um driven by drugs 
and i think that uh were corporations and uh private industry to take um take command in this situation that maybe maybe we might have some some control over that 
we you know 
if you can n't work then you can n't be a little bit harder to take take the drugs or whatever 
i do n't know 
um-hum right 
course that might up crime you know and uh people go in and steal your television and stea- and sell it just because they can n't they can n't work anymore you know 
yeah 
yeah 
but you got to have a a safe work place 
that 's all there is to it 
definitely 
y- y- you 're definitely right that you can n't you can n't have it any other way 
um-hum 
uh yeah you know whether whether in in the case that you brought up you know whether uh you know whe- if it 's a policeman and he 's working with uh the public and he has a and has a gun in his holster or or even you know if it 's a guy at mcdonald 's cooking a burger i think they 're dangerous in either situation 
um-hum 
um i 
d- what what do you think um 
what percentage of of corporations and uh private industry do you think use uh drug testing 
i think it 's it 's more frequent now 
it 's probably like forty fifty percent 
oh really 
yeah 
uh-huh 
because uh all the jobs that i 've applied for have uh mentioned some type of drug screening yeah 
right 
yeah what kind of work are you in 
uh i work at sears 
uh-huh 
and i just do warehouse work 
uh-huh 
and did they give you drug testing 
uh not 
they hired me in nineteen eighty four 
so 
oh 
yeah 
okay 
but now they they uh they issued a statement about that about three months ago 
uh-huh 
oh so are they going to uh begin spontaneous uh drug testing 
uh not that i know of 
it was more about uh all the people 's problems 
like they 've been laying off a lot of people 
uh-huh 
oh yeah 
and uh and uh they sent out uh employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem 
sure 
family problems you know 
uh-huh 
it kind of covered everything 
uh-huh 
but i know they have a lot of drug problems 
so 
yeah 
what do you think about um you know 
something that kind of concerns me is uh you you know you and i are tested for for whatever work we happen to do 
do you think there should be drug testing for political officials 
yes 
i do because because a lot of them are you know they 're hypocritical 
yeah 
i do too 
they they talk against drugs and then they get caught you know in stings in washington 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
whether it 's drugs or any other kind of uh 
like the the money laundering scams all that was drug related 
oh yeah 
so and that cost u- the country you know billions of dollars 
sure 
sure 
yeah 
so 
i would agree with you 
i i can n't see i can n't see how we can expect the you know uh uh people working in the in in america to um uh to put any trust into our political officials if they do n't you know uh 
it just does n't make sense to have them i- i- to to worry about legislation unless they 're doing that themselves 
okay 
yeah 
well considering you moved here from california i guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you would have down there 
oh yeah 
we have um in california 
i 'm in c- i lived in central california 
we have rain couple times a year 
and other than that you know it 'd be maybe october and then in the spring 
and then other than that there would n't be any rain so 
especially the last few years 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's kind of has it 's kind of been a drought out there has n't it uh 
yeah 
there has 
so here i know that um last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state 
and i 'm glad to see there have n't been any this year 
that 's what i was thinking yet 
yeah 
yet 
still could come 
huh 
generally if we 're going to get them it 's not going to happen uh prior to january one 
uh-huh 
you know you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we 've been getting in december 
but usually the bitterest weather if we 're going to have any comes in january and february 
yeah 
hm 
then by march things are getting warm again 
so we really do n't have as long a cold season i guess as people up north 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's so hard to predict here 
it 's been eighty degrees on christmas day here before 
yeah 
lots of times 
well today it 's not bad out there 
no 
it 's nice 
i just came in from outside and it 's it 's really pretty 
um-hum 
it 's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out -fore it rains again 
yeah 
yeah 
i 'm a i 'm a scoutmaster 
and so i wind up going out camping with uh a bunch o- boys at one time 
and so its better for us if it has n't been just totally wet before we go 
uh-huh 
yeah 
so you do that even in january huh 
oh yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
we camp year round 
yeah oh 
that 's interesting 
but uh it 's uh it 's definitely different 
um-hum 
and then i guess you 've been through a couple of summers here too right 
yeah 
yep 
and they 're not too pleasant 
it gets so humid 
to me it 's humid here 
people that i know that come from um like georgia or north carolina yeah they say this 
well it is 
it 's not as humid as houston say or atlanta 
but it its more humid than arizona 
is n't humid yeah 
but i find it 
and california for the most part 
humid right 
were you northern california 
yeah i was central california 
central 
central valley 
okay so that was dry but pretty even climate was n't it year round fairly not wide fluctuations 
so -t 's very dry there 
yeah 
yeah 
well it 's pretty hot in the summer 
it 's in the usually you know 
for good three four weeks we have over a hundred degrees 
but it 's a drier 
but it 's a dry heat yeah 
hundred when you have a hundred here everybody 's dying 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i know huh well i lived in africa for a couple years in cameroon 
oh 
and that 's a tropical climate 
and it really feels similar to this during the summer 
what types of what take what type of business takes you to those climates 
or was that just vacation or something 
no 
i was um working with um i still work with wycliffe bible translators 
oh 
it 's an organization where we are looking to translate the bible into languages of the world that are n't yet written 
not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages 
right 
languages that do n't have anything written yet 
so this is like the first thing that 's written down 
or you know first an alphabet is developed 
oh 
and then um 
that 's interesting 
so 
you do n't think about that as a career a normal career uh when you 're thinking of things that people might be doing 
yeah 
yeah 
well it 's based here 
um the international headquarters for wycliffe bible translators is right here in in dallas 
oh so you 're you 're with the home office now 
yeah 
right now i am 
so that 's what brought me here 
yeah 
well the uh i think uh all in all there are a lot worse climates than dallas uh 
the weather you know does change fast 
yeah 
and things do happen severely a few times a year 
but there 's an awful lot of good weather too in between 
yeah i agree 
i agree 
i i thought the fall was really nice 
yeah 
and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze 
uh-huh 
and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh i like that particularly if i 'm going to be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things 
yeah 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
and that 's nicer 
yeah 
and you probably do a lot of that with scouts scouting 
yeah 
i do quite a bit of that 
uh-huh 
think we 're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east texas 
and it is a little more humid out there than it is here 
so i guess we 'll 
um-hum 
the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains 
um-hum 
there 's not much between us and the north pole 
yeah 
and then when you get one of those tornado type systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms 
um-hum 
and it it does n't seem to be 
okay um 
some of the tv shows i like to watch are um mostly evening evening shows 
and uh like for instance the one i 'm looking forward to to tonight is twenty twenty 
i usually watch those prime time programs 
right 
uh i like to watch forty eight hours never miss that and uh sometimes prime time live 
um and then the week goes by 
and i do n't think ever watch anything else 
you know the the sunday night movies i watch those kind of things but uh most- but basically a lot of documentary things and you know what 's going on and that kind of thing 
i li- i have a few you know favorite shows that i try not to miss 
uh-huh 
l a law is one of them 
uh-huh 
although this year 's it 's a little easier to miss than last year with the new cast and everything 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's hard to follow 
an- right 
and uh i like rosie oneil 
oh i 've never seen that one 
the trials of rosie oneil with sharon gleese 
okay 
yeah 
sh- 
i 've seen a uh the previews for that 
it 's very good 
it it 's probably very much a woman 's mo- uh show 
uh-huh 
but uh and then there 's a new sitcom on that is tim allen 's uh what is it uh handyman 
that 's not what uh 
home improvement 
oh we never miss that 
or we try not to miss that 
it 's hysterical is n't it 
oh we think it is so funny 
did you catch the christmas 
oh i just part of it 
i thought it was you know 
and it had such a good story too 
uh-huh 
did you see the end of it 
no 
well you know the little boy the little one was trying to decide if there was a santa claus 
uh-huh 
oh that 's right 
and the neighbor 
they thought it was the neighbor 
they thought it was the neighbor 
and he gave the two doubting thomases a rubber band and a paper clip 
yeah 
i thought that was wonderful 
yeah and then uh it it 's it appeared that maybe it probably was n't the neighbor 
and uh on sunday used to be on sunday nights 
now i can n't figure out where they 've moved it 
on our uh public television they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show 
um-hum 
and it showed the latest uh developments from all the computer companies 
uh-huh 
i 've never seen that program 
well you know it 's 
unless you 're really into computers you w- and software you probably would n't be interested 
uh-huh 
but i do n't know 
uh-huh 
it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there 
oh 
and uh you know what uh they they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets you know and then they also the hardware 
oh 
uh-huh 
so y- you could see what the new developments were and what to look for 
and i enjoyed that 
um-hum 
it was just a thirty minute show with no commercials 
oh okay 
it 's public television 
course does n't have the commercials during the show 
so 
yeah 
right 
and i like the frugal gourmet 
oh i do too 
oh i do too 
uh but i just seem to to miss a lot of these programs 
i do n't know why 
i just 
if i can catch them i do 
or if i remember 
i well there 's very few that you know my life would stop if i did n't catch 
but uh now i do before i go to work i tape my soap opera 
oh yeah 
i watch one 
an- 
well i watch two 
but one 's a half hour 
and one 's an hour 
and and they lead into each other 
oh 
and that 's the bold and the beautiful and as the world turns 
oh okay 
and i 've watched the as the world turns since i was a little girl 
yeah 
that 's been on for years 
so it 's just you know 
it 's it 's something i 've done for the last probably twenty five years 
oh and so you get to come home and watch them 
yes 
and i do n't have anyone else at home 
so i have freedom to watch whatever i want 
yeah 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but i like i like every i like the uh the information shows 
and i like the comedies 
and you know and i i do like good movies 
uh-huh 
i prescribed subscribe to h b o so i can get some of the movies 
yeah 
well we 
yeah 
that 's a good idea 
we did have h b o 
but it we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious you know 
it is 
it 's just 
but i do n't sleep a whole lot 
and i you know 
at two oclock in the morning there is n't anything on regular tv 
and and uh so that 's 
oh 
oh yes 
if you 're up then 
and you do n't get good reception without cable 
and it does n't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels 
yeah 
right 
so that 's primarily why i have it right now 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
i i thought when i got my v c r i 'd probably drop it you know 
but that was years 
hello 
yes 
i forgot we had to hit one 
or our time will be up 
well i hit one and nothing happened 
what 's going on 
well just go ahead and talk 
that 's all 
are you sure 
yeah 
do n't they usually tell you to say something 
i do n't think so 
oh 
huh-uh 
okay 
we 're supposed to talk about lawn and garden 
yes 
i 'm i 'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden 
what do i do 
uh-huh 
well i uh i cut it occasionally 
good 
uh-huh 
you 're ahead of me 
is uh is that good 
okay 
that 's better 
and i edge it occasionally 
oh that 's really good 
yeah 
see am i good or what 
yes 
and uh i uh m- much beyond that i do n't do 
i do n't do any of that 
really 
well i call my lawn man eric whatever his name is i can n't remember who 's going to come and build me a fence too 
uh-huh 
oh he is going to go through fence 
well he 's going to give me an estimate 
uh-huh 
and for ten dollars a week i do n't see any reason for me to be doing it 
what for a fence 
no for my yard yeah 
oh well i thought is n't he the same one 
he is 
yeah 
yeah 
but ten dollars or what i- what does he charge not even that 
what does he charge me 
what am 
i i do n't know 
it 's like next to nothing 
it 's ten because i 
it 's forty a month 
yeah 
but if there 's five weeks i still pay forty 
yeah 
but you know you ought to get him to g- pull the weeds 
well he wo n't pull weeds 
he says he 'll spray them 
but he wo n't pull them 
oh 
uh he wo n't cut them is what he wo n't do because he said with the rocks that it 's too dangerous for him to take the the trimmer over the rocks 
um-hum 
yeah 
uh-huh 
and he 's right 
yeah 
that 's true 
but he just says to keep spraying them so 
well so 
anyway gene sprayed them once or twice for me 
so that was free 
yeah 
so you have n't you have n't pulled any weeds lately 
no 
no 
there are two out front 
i thought i 'd grab one of these days 
but i have n't bothered as i walk on by 
yeah 
i start to pull the weeds in the rocks out front and all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds 
uh-huh 
and there was dog dirt in it and i threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there 
oh oh goody 
and i left the whole thing 
and that was about a month ago 
i thought you were going to say the- i thought you going to say there was a snake in the weeds 
i would rather a snake 
no 
oh god oh 
i just left the whole thing 
the bag is still out there because i have n't touched 
yeah 
i have n't gone back over there 
it really made me mad 
oh god 
so anyway but 
but uh how are your your flowers your little things you planted 
did they die or what 
oh yeah 
now they died 
oh they 're all 
so they oh 
are they going to come back in the spring 
i do n't know 
oh 
i do n't know 
and then i got some nice uh mums at thanksgiving that i put in the pots out there and i thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather 
uh-huh 
yeah 
they looked real pretty until about a week before christmas 
then they started to die too 
oh 
so i do n't think any of it comes back 
but i do n't know 
yeah 
maybe 
sometimes things do that are n't even supposed to 
i do n't know uh 
so 
those flowers remember those little ones you gave me 
yeah 
yeah 
well they 're i know they were still blooming up until about a a few weeks ago 
really 
yeah 
well that 's good 
they 're the best kind 
yeah 
they they 're really pretty 
they they 're like indestructible 
they really grow nice 
and sometimes they 're not supposed to come back 
but lots of times they do 
uh-huh 
so 
yeah 
we 'll see 
they 're letting us have a lot of time on this are n't they 
yeah 
i mean is n't it supposed to be five minutes 
but that 's because we did n't hit one for a long time 
we did n't disconnect did we 
i hope not 
neither one of us is getting paid for this 
oh i hate to think i hate to think i 'd be talking to you without getting paid 
yeah 
really 
i know it 
i can n't believe this 
i got somebody from utah and somebody 
what 
uh-huh 
where was the person last night was from far away 
you 're kidding 
really 
and we get each other down the street 
this is so funny 
well uh the uh 
i g- i talked to someone woman from oklahoma city and some woman from dallas 
and that was it 
yeah 
i 've had dallas arlington 
i 've had uh one plano and then a lady from brigham utah whose son lives in plano on ranier someplace and then um another state 
uh-huh 
wow 
really 
i can n't remember 
but she told me about the utah jazz 
we talked about basketball 
oh really 
and i do n't remember what what the place was last night 
like i 'm thinking colorado 
yeah 
but i 'm not sure 
another place anyway 
uh-huh 
so 
i do n't know 
this 
the but mostly they 're from the area 
yeah 
this 
well there is n't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes 
not for me 
not for me either 
you know not not for me because all i have is rocks and weeds 
what do i 
yeah 
but i do n't you know 
i what do i do cut it one you know and and edge it 
and that 's about it 
i know 
what do i do with it 
i know 
we 're not typical texans 
no 
but 
what 's going on 
are they going to tell us to s- stop or what 
-ell i do n't know 
i hope so 
come on 
come on 
is n't it five minutes 
i do n't know 
i i mean i 'm all talked out about gardens 
i know 
well we can talk about something else 
it 's just a suggested topic 
oh oh it 's just suggested 
so how 's the baby do you think 
what 
how 's the 
we could talk let 's talk about the baby 
let 's talk about the baby 
do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan 
yeah 
our budgeting plans includes me getting a job 
we 're we 're at the point now 
i i uh i quit working about six months ago to start this house and i 'm out of cash 
uh-huh 
and i 'm not out of project yet 
oh no 
so uh i 'm going to go back and do some consulting work 
as far as budget 's concerned i 'm i 'm fairly fortunate 
uh we 've we 're right now where if we do n't buy anything extra we can make it on what my wife makes 
so uh the project 's kind of halted until then 
as far as budgeting is concerned you know we have uh some pretty strict guidelines that we go for you know 
we always put ten percent back 
and that 's a never touch 
uh into savings 
yeah 
huh 
either savings or investment one of the two 
but we do n't ever put it at a high risk 
it 's just always going to be there 
well that 's pretty good 
and as far as the rest of it 's concerned we do n't have any kind of uh what i would call extravagant expenses you know 
uh we uh we pretty much live on about eight nine hundred a month you know just travel to and from work and clothing and food and the rest of it you know we pile into the house 
boy that 's pretty good 
and uh you know i 'm fairly fortunate 
i mean our credit cards are out to the max right now because i 'm a little a little behind on that 
sure 
but uh we 're still making the payments on them 
it 's just uh when you 
see in texas you can not borrow the money to build your own home and do it yourself 
yeah it 's it 's tough here too 
you have to have the contractor sign with you 
right 
exactly 
but it 's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who 'll sign it and let you do it here in u- where i live that is 
yeah 
and where i live i- it 's pretty scary because texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up you do n't get it finished 
uh-huh 
the bank can eat the contractor 
oh bad for him huh 
yeah 
bad for him 
but the homeowner can n't be touched 
hum 
it 's a homestead state 
is that right 
yeah 
see right now if i quit paying any of my bills 
the only thing they could do is cut off the electricity 
they can n't take your land unless you do n't pay your land taxes period 
wow 
you know they take your car and your clothes and your anything 
that 's not the tools of your trade 
but as far as uh you know you 're pretty much bullet proof in this state 
well that 's kind of handy 
yeah 
i just finished james michener 's texas book 
uh-huh 
pretty interesting 
texas has quite the history 
well you know we 're we 're not ones to budget much you know 
we just got to spend it all 
that 's kind of what we do 
we uh we 're lds 
and so we pay ten percent tithing and then i know we put i guess it 's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but that sometimes we use for emergency type things 
yeah 
but uh and my wife does n't work 
we 're fortunate that way that i make enough to do what we want to do 
yeah 
yeah 
we 're pretty pretty fortunate as far as the uh the budgeting is concerned because you know we do n't have any long term debt 
you know uh we paid cash for car 
well we bought the car on time one of them 
but we you know we since paid it off 
well that 's pretty 
and the land is paid for cash 
so we do n't have to worry about that 
that 's a great position to be in 
well it 's fraught with other problems 
is that right 
yeah 
i 'm not very motivated 
oh 
what kind of consulting do you do 
uh systems consulting computerization for construction firms 
is that right 
yeah 
i 'm into computers too 
i i 'm a e d p auditor 
are 
you oh 
and 
you into mainframes 
ye- 
and pcs 
an- oh really 
yeah 
i 'm just brushing up on well c plus plus 
are you really 
uh-huh 
and 
i just got that a few days ago 
trio ah 
oh jeez 
do n't get me to lying 
i bought it at a fire sale 
this guy 's place burned down 
and he had a bunch of computer stuff 
and you know i bought it all 
it was two hundred bucks for everything he had 
you got a buy 
well some of it was n't worth anything you know 
sure 
you know a lot of the uh diskettes were just totally unusable 
melted or just wet 
or 
well yeah 
or wet 
okay 
but i did get out of there with uh vermont views which is a huge subroutine libra- 
what kind of movies have you been seeing lately 
uh it 's been probably a month or so since i 've been to the movies 
uh course my my favorite now is is dances with wolves 
oh it 's an excellent movie 
uh silence of the lambs uh of the lambs was good 
silence of the lambs 
uh-huh 
what was that anyway 
oh it 's a i guess it 's a mystery you 'd call it 
it 's with uh jodie foster 
because i did n't get a chance to see it okay 
and it uh it 's pretty good 
another one that i think i really liked was uh the fisher king 
um-hum 
let 's see 
who was in fisher king 
that was um robin williams and uh and um 
right 
i can n't say the other fellow 's name 
how about you 
what are you 
uh we 've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately 
um we really enjoyed um dead poet 's society 
yes 
um several years back when we saw uh we saw the we really really enjoyed was uh ordinary people with um timothy hutton and uh mary tyler moore and uh uh 
who played the father anyway excellent movie 
right 
that was that was an excellent movie 
have you seen dances with wolves 
yes 
we have 
that what 'd you think of it 
oh we loved it 
i do n't think i can see it enough times 
i know what you mean 
i know what you mean 
course i 'm a kevin costner fan 
yeah 
um pretty impressed with stuff he 's done 
uh he made kind of an odd sounding robin hood 
but uh i mean you know basic thick western us accent for a robin hood just does n't seem to fit 
no 
but you know it was n't bad movie 
but oh no 
it was a good movie 
it got such bad reviews really 
and and i thoroughly enjoyed it 
but i then i was n't expecting any classic either 
well um they did a real good job with it 
i thought so 
um they did n't try to make him super human or you know invincible 
they just 
he worked hard at it 
have you seen the fisher king 
no 
i have n't not had the opportunity to see that uh 
uh it you you know i guess it it really is n't for everybody 
it 's it 's pretty deep and and uh uh philosophical 
yeah 
but i thought it had a wonderful message to it 
it 's kind you came out and looked at somebody says you know i think i liked that 
yeah 
and then the more you got to thinking about it the more you thought you know i did like it 
yeah 
but when you first came out you were n't real sure 
it sounds kind of like one uh we saw at home here on the w- rented it um clara 's heart 
have n't seen that 
um it 's whoopi goldberg 
oh yes 
i did 
yes 
i did 
yeah she played a uh they um 
she was a housekeeper 
uh n- the nanny type 
yeah 
she 's a housekeeper 
she she was um oh no i can n't say it not haitian 
housekeeper uh-huh 
anyway she uh she seemed to be that sort of person that you know about seems half crazy 
but then again she 's got a whole lot on the ball 
and the movie had the whole uh a lot of philosophical content more than more than you know 
it it was n't a mystery 
it was n't a you know blood and guts and violence and and and car chases type thing 
it was just a good movie 
i saw one the other day that was a kiss before dying 
a kiss before dying 
um-hum 
i had not heard about it when it was on the movies 
but was out on video 
yeah 
and it 's with sean young 
yeah 
and it 's a it 's a mystery 
it was very predictable 
i mean you knew you knew when the murder was going to happen or something 
but it was still so well done that it was enjoyable 
yeah 
that 's that takes a good bit to make one that 's predictable but still worth watching 
that 's right 
i had uh oh uh 
i like the i think it 's called the uh razor 's edge 
the 
no no 
the jagged edge 
the jagged edge with uh 
not familiar with that one oh okay 
-erry tell me ab- what you think about the vietnam war 
okay 
well i 'm a vietnam era veteran 
and uh i was uh uh fortunate not to have to serve in the theater 
however uh m- my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation uh 
i 'm of the old school that believes that um the uh uh contracts that we made back years ago uh needed to be honored 
however uh i think we could 've executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker oh 
but those are my personal thoughts 
and i think that if we 'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run world war two we 'd have got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people 
but as it was the politicians ran the the korean conflict and ultimately the vietnam thing 
and we managed to come out uh losers all way around 
and so this is what trigger- ultimately triggered the us uh uh the united states per se being uh deciding to get out of the role of world policeman 
your views 
uh-huh as i understand it and i uh don- do n't a lot about it uh we got in there because of france uh france was there first 
well 
they had 
we got into it because of a seato agreement back just right after world war two that uh we pledged a mutual um uh defense of of the south vietnamese 
and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another 
and really we 
i i question us you know now 
of course uh hindsight is all too clear 
sure 
um so we 're we we have to have to deal with with the uh situation as as we played it 
jerry what did you think of people like uh jane fonda another war an- antiwar activist 
but i 
do n't get me started on those people 
you know before sh- before jane fonda did did what she did i thought she was a wonderful person 
but after uh uh well 
i- i just do n't have anything want anything to do with her anymore 
because you support uh you support your government 
right or wrong 
uh okay 
right or wrong 
i do n't think is is we can determine whether we were right or wrong 
because you 're you 're having to deal with a- again uh 
i think we could 've made a different agreement back in for- the fort- the late forties era that would 've kept out of there 
uh-huh 
uh you know i i did n't realize that we 'd signed some type of deal like that 
i thought we came in a- as first advisors to the the french and then they decided to pull out 
and 
so can you hold just s- second terry 
sure 
one moment please 
sure 
wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something 
huh that 's 
neat well that 's not 
sorry for the delay 
that 's okay 
uh yeah 
this is 
the uh the the uh the mutual defense thing was 
we we 
yeah it was complicated 
and i do n't think everybody knows the whole situation 
i do n't 
but from what i can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the uh south vietnamese uh should they ask 
well the french went in and tried their old style warfare and uh got soundly thrashed 
and we did n't do a whole lot better 
um no 
i had thought that they had uh colonies there or something 
well yeah 
that was the old french colony but see the french the french were our uh allies in nato and they 're also our allies in seato which was the south east asia treaty organization which has since been a- disbanded as far as i know 
right 
you know nato is is on the way of being disbanded uh 
but uh the yeah the fren- yeah 
we went in as an ally to the french and says yeah we 'll we 'll help you out if you get in a bind 
well they got in a bind and says we do n't want to you know play anymore so uh we we kind of we kind of got st- got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organi- uh um oh o- operations and then a full scale you know full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera 
uh-huh 
i see yeah 
i 'm thirty two 
so uh i bare- 
well i missed it 
seventy four is when we quit sending troops 
ah 
yeah 
roughly 
o- yeah 
i- i was just probably thr- three or four years ol- 
okay 
you got any hobbies that you want to talk about 
well i uh do n't seem to have as much spare time as i used to 
but i guess i 'll have to say my computer has probably taken the place of most of my hobbies 
what in the world do you do with your computer that takes so much time 
well i sit and design cards and uh oh i i 'm really into graphics 
oh really 
so it it just i sit and learn new programs 
and i play 
and i do this 
and i do that 
and 
uh did you have uh your own business 
or you do that as just on the side 
or what 
i 'm i 'm starting a side business in desk top publishing and uh it 's just getting going 
um-hum 
i i 'm teaching in the daytime and uh 
well 
what do you teach 
i teach business and computer technology 
oh that 's good 
well i guess 
it 's uh to high school kids it uh it 's alternative learning and uh it 's it 's really a challenge 
that 's good it wa- uh-huh 
but 
what hobbies do you have 
well i uh play trombone in the plano community band 
ooh neat 
and i uh like to do a lot of bicycling when the weathers allows 
and during summer when there 's daylight savings time 's when i get out and bike 
well i hope y 'all had as pretty a day today as we did 
well it was n't too bad other than the cowboys did n't do so hot 
oh well now ye- 
i do n't think you can blame the weather on that 
we had 
no 
just a crummy 
well actually the lions are pretty good i am afraid 
they 're pro- 
a lot better team than the cowboys were today 
and uh 
on any given day they say 
uh uh i have n't i have n't played in a while 
but i do when i get time and it 's pretty weather and it 's summer i like to play golf 
oh oh okay 
i- i play that about six times a year 
and every year i hang my bag up uh i- if i get that fi- or six 
and i swear swear that game off for another year 
but i always go back to it 
oh i uh oh i take spells 
i- i 'm i 'm kind of a compulsive obsessive person 
and when when i start something i- i go into it a thousand percent and then i get i get burned out on it 
i understand that 
but uh i do some counted cross stitch and some painting on shirts 
well you do lots of stuff 
well it does n't seem like i get anything done 
but i guess i do 
and i- i like to bake 
it 's just me in the house 
so when i bake it 's usually to take out for something 
gosh 
i come up there i 'll have to stop by and have so- try your some of your bakery 
well 
i- i call on people in i 
my business is uh machine tool sales 
and i have some 
i- i cover texas and oklahoma 
oh okay 
so i what i said that i was n't being real facetious about that 
i- i got customers in oklahoma city and tulsa and perry oklahoma and eda and all that all that way 
oh how neat 
so you do quite a bit of traveling then 
yes 
yes 
i 
about thirty three thousand miles a year 
so 
ooh well that does n't leave a lot of time for hobbies does it 
well i usually 
see we we have our 
uh our band practice is on monday night 
and during the summer we uh we have concerts every monday night in the park 
and uh we we have you know some concerts during the year 
and you know various people communities want us to play for things 
but those are usually on the weekend 
so that is n't too bad 
how big is your band 
well we got uh pretty good size band 
not everybody shows up 
but if everyone did we 'd probably have over a hundred 
but we only average about forty to fifty people a you know a usually 
ooh 
well that 's still a pretty bi- good size band 
but uh yeah 
it 's not like there four or five of you then 
oh no 
no 
this is a it 's a concert band 
and uh we have a lot o- 
i- i do n't pretend to be that good 
but there 's a lot of people that uh you know our uh band directors at schools or have been 
or uh you know there some people that are actually mu- music majors 
they do n't necessarily follow that anymore you know 
that is n't necessarily their career 
but uh we have some extremely good talent in there 
and uh as a rule it sounds pretty decent 
so it 's fun 
i 'm i have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever 
and i 'm always very envious of people who do 
well i do n't know if i have any or not 
i i 've always enjoyed it 
i sing in a church choir on wednesday nights when i 'm around and play in the band on monday nights and keeps you out of trouble that way 
well i 'm probably one of the few people that the childr- 
okay 
what kind of foods would you have 
okay 
um well i like to cook um but i do n't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because um uh it 's too much pressure you know 
oh i do too 
hum-um 
uh-huh well 
if i have people over for dinner i like it to be nice but relaxed 
yeah 
you can n't enjoy it 
right 
yeah 
and so i do n't like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out 
that 's that 's what 
i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking in the oven 
so yeah 
it 's everybody just says how wonderful it is 
exactly 
and it 's it 's like uh yes 
uh-huh 
uh i 
yeah 
that 's one of those things that i got famous for in college 
people would come and say could you would you come over and make lasagna for me 
uh-huh 
it 's like well i can n't really give you a recipe um i can i can just do it 
uh-huh 
you just do it 
so it 's i like doing that kind of stuff 
uh-huh yeah 
and it 's it 's fun 
because in fact that 's what we had for a christmas party last week 
uh-huh 
we just had a bunch of people over 
and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and ah yummy 
um boy i like that 
uh i do too in fact 
yeah 
well i 'm planning a 
and naturally this is appropriate because i 'm planning dinner for um people tomorrow night and the next night 
oh 
oh good 
hm on tuesday night there 'll be eight people here altogether 
uh i 'd say one thing we 've do- have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it 's a real easy is just baked potato dinners 
so oh yeah 
uh-huh 
and have you like three or four couples come over 
and i 'll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like and it turns out great because i mean you 've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that 's fun 
uh-huh 
but it 's it 's inexpensive plus it 's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it 
yeah 
and you got a great dinner 
yeah 
that 's a good idea 
it 's it 's real easy 
i like doing that part 
yeah 
ah i 'm in favor of very little clean up um very little planning because we 've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and it 's 
uh-huh 
we invariably end up at my house since i 've got two kids 
uh-huh 
and that it 's it 's fine because then i can just say okay fine 
you bring this 
you bring this 
you bring this 
we 're done 
yeah 
oh it 's pretty cool 
yeah 
that 's good 
well one of my favorites if i do n't want to have other people bring stuff i just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice 
uh-huh 
oh 
it 's it 's very easy to 
oh 
you do n't like it 
oh i love it 
oh you do 
okay 
yeah 
i have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken 
and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan 
you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it and or you put the chicken in then pour the uh broth over 
hm 
and you can put mushrooms in if you want 
and then just 
oh over the uncooked rice 
yeah 
over uncooked rice and you can either microwave it 
oh 
or do it in the oven 
and it just 
oh how neat 
it fluffs up 
and it 's really moist 
huh 
now i 've done it with where you put you cook the ri- well i guess you probably could do it some way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and pu- a bit of white wine in it 
and um-hum uh-huh 
ooh 
yeah 
and every once in a while i 'll put in white i 'll slice white grapes 
and i 'll put it in there 
and that 's because i 'm not a real big wine person 
but i like it 
it it adds something to the chicken 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and then just bake it 
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice 
hm well i 'll keep that one in mind 
yeah 
too yeah 
it 's it that was one of the first things i made for my husband because it 's like hm 
yeah i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
you can get away with it and you know in having a semi nice dinner 
oh yeah 
or you know semi 
but then i di- i had n't thought about doing it with uncooked rice 
formal but yeah 
so just like in a thirteen by nine pan 
yeah 
you put in um let 's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice 
hm 
or 
hm 
it depends on 
you can really vary it 
uh-huh 
but you have to put the water in proportionally 
i can n't remember 
i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups um broth 
huh yeah 
yeah 
it 's i i use that for brea- for rice 
and for when i cook pasta or something i 'll i 'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor 
and yeah 
that 's flavor 
um-hum 
yeah 
hm now that would be good 
uh-huh 
how long do you have to bake it 
um let 's see 
i think it was an hour 
i 've done it in the microwave so often lately because it 's it 's really easy 
i do i do microwave too a lot 
yeah 
but i think it 's about an hour 
it 's how long would it be in the m- how long would it be in the microwave 
or maybe it 's only half hour 
hm um you just 
until the rice looks fluffy and and not overdone you know before it gets overdone 
oh okay 
okay 
do you just brown the chicken to get it colored or do you go ahead and let it cook through 
yeah 
yeah um i 'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster 
okay hm 
oh this is a beneficial call 
i like this 
but yeah 
well i liked it your idea too there 
yeah 
but that one 's an easy one 
it 's like just put in 
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the with the soup and the wine put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that you know wh- whatever you however much effort you feel like putting into it 
uh-huh 
yeah 
uh-huh 
but it it makes a great 
i mean m- i 've got a two year old and a four year old 
and they love it 
uh-huh 
and be- because my daughter calls it her gravy 
and i mean she thinks it 's wonderful 
i 'm like good you 're a picky eater if i can get you to ea- 
say you did uh starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one 
yeah 
and uh helped my wife replace some carburetors 
yeah 
some that she had to uh um label everything 
she had to label everything 
yeah 
because 
what was she driving 
it was a cadillac 
uh-huh 
and they uh well they quit making those the quadrajet carburetor 
and they quit making it 
yeah 
they rebuilt it 
and it never did never did run right again 
yeah 
quadrajet not real easy to get rebuilt just right 
yeah 
um what were you replacing the starters and bendix drives on 
um a maverick and also um a chrysler station wagon before that 
yeah 
did you replace just the uh the bendix on the chrysler station wagon or the whole starter 
uh the i 'm replacing th- two or three starters on the chrysler 
yeah 
they 
the starters are kind of fragile 
yeah 
and the 
especially if you need a tune up 
um-hum 
they kept saying that the chrys- that 's what chryslers did is they wore out starters 
yeah 
well i- i- if 
they start real easy you know 
you just hit the key 
and it starts up and when it 's properly tuned up that starter will last for a long time 
you know yeah 
see they built that starter so it 'd fit every v-8 and all the slant sixes that they built in like thirty five years 
right 
they all take the exact same starter 
they 'll interchange completely 
i mean completely 
one starter will fit all of them 
so they 've got a whole lot of torque 
but to do that th- did uh they use an underdrive system 
where they geared it down so its motor spins really fast so it 's got to spin for very long 
um-hum 
it 's kind of tough on the bushings 
yeah 
usually what goes is the bushings 
right 
you take a little time replace the bushings you still got a perfectly good starter 
but uh most places do n't put do n't rebuild them with with g- with good enough bushings 
um-hum 
so it 's you know after you get rebuilt one you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly especially if you need a tune-up 
no 
anyway what are you driving now 
um my chrysler van 
and it 's it 's pretty maintenance free you know 
and uh and beginning the year last year and drove a chevrolet cavalier station wagon 
and it did n't give me any trouble at all 
that 's good 
yeah 
what is it a late model set chrysler van 
it 's a eighty seven 
yeah 
one of the little minivans 
um-hum 
yeah 
is it 
do you like the way it rides and such 
uh rides or runs 
rides rough 
it 
yeah 
well yeah 
it rides rides rough 
it runs good 
yeah 
you know i kind of 
it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine 
yeah 
you have to kind of wait for it especially when you get on the highway 
yeah 
right now without getting some of the sportier models uh the four cylinders are n't real peppy 
yeah 
but uh they 're starting to change that out in the last couple of years too 
you driven american cars all 
uh see 
i 've driven one im- uh 
i drove a volkswagen beetle for a while about a month 
um in that month i think i put uh three oil coolers on it 
um every time i turned around i was having trouble with it 
um-hum 
everything else i ever owned was american built 
uh mostly older cars 
um i 've been a mechanic 
well i worked starting working my father 's service station when i was about uh twelve 
n- 
so i 've been around cars a lot 
but uh driven a lot of old pontiacs 
my first three cars were uh seventy model pontiacs a gto and a bonneville and a station wagon 
and i had a couple of chryslers 
had a super b for a while with a four forty in it 
it a lot of fun 
but uh 
not much gas mileage though 
i do n't know 
gas mileage was n't too bad 
i got about seventeen 
oh wow 
well till you got crazy with it 
you know you get the four barrel all worked up 
and suddenly it it it drops off fast 
but long as you did n't spin the tires too much or or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it it did n't do too bad on gas 
yeah 
did n't have to work very hard to move the car around 
now do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs 
oh yeah 
yeah 
definitely 
um-hum 
you 
know the 
my last gm car was a seventy chevy station wagon 
uh it still had the points and condenser in it 
when i rebuilt the engine on that about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car 
yeah 
i uh pulled that old points distributor out and got a an hei distributor electronic distributor and put into it 
okay um 
do you have any pets now 
well we do n't right now 
no 
we 've uh 
i grew up with uh with pets 
my folks and i always had a dog and a cat some birds 
yeah 
but uh right now we do n't have anything 
oh okay 
um that 
what about you 
a matter of choice or compulsion 
well we 've just um 
it seems like we 've always been at a place where we 'd have to go away for the summer or something 
and uh it was never convenient to have anything 
yeah 
i we 're thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house 
yeah 
uh someplace where there are you know 
we can take care of it and everything 
we 've got some children who would just really uh enjoy having an animal you know a dog i think 
yeah 
and what about you all 
yeah 
well right now i 'm student 
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that 
um-hum oh no 
no 
we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat 
is that right 
yeah 
they 're very strict about it 
but you like uh you like pets and things 
oh love animals 
oh yeah 
i was raised 
our house when i when i was growing up there was almost never uh at least one cat in the house 
um-hum 
it 's al- almost always at least one cat sometimes you know like fifteen or twenty but uh always cats in the house 
oh yeah 
we en- we enjoyed them 
always 
uh we like we like pets 
but um you know you 've got to deal with uh taking care of them and and feeding them and everything like that 
yeah 
and our kids are 
we 've got some children 
and they 're not not used to it you know on a daily basis 
they they uh 
how old are your kids 
and oh from fourteen down to seven 
um okay 
you 've sound like you 've got some small ones in the background 
one 
is that right 
our first 
he 's about te- eleven weeks now 
oh great 
yeah 
congratulations 
yeah 
where are you from 
uh originally 
um-hum 
west virginia 
okay 
um i do n't know how familiar you are with that area of the country 
bu- 
i been to charleston 
charleston west virginia 
yes 
uh-huh 
okay 
that 's pretty much the south end of the state or the southern quarter of the state anyway 
um-hum 
okay 
in the north end of the state you got that little narrow strip of west virginia going up between ohio and pennsylvania 
um-hum 
right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown 
um-hum 
well that 's yeah that 's interesting 
so it 's really up north in the country really 
yeah 
uh it 's i guess uh 
yeah 
it 's 
well uh my parents house is like three miles south of where the mason dixon line would have hit the ohio river had it continued that far 
gosh 
i see 
so 
pretty nice country up there 
oh it 's beautiful 
hills or what 
uh well from my neck of the woods it 's hilly 
um-hum 
um you know uh maybe three hundred four hundred feet elevation uh -at type variations from the valleys up to the hills to hilltops 
um-hum 
is it a farmland 
um not a lot of farmland there 
mostly it 's uh 
i mean you know there 's you know individuals with their own own f- uh growing their own food 
uh most of the agriculture it 's more in the way of uh sheep and cattle 
oh yes 
and even that 's you know small time mostly 
um-hum sure 
uh the biggest chunk of what 's going on there is is uh industries 
um-hum 
coal mines and chemical plants and power plants 
okay 
uh aluminum plants 
there 's like two aluminum plants 
what are you what are you studying there at hattiesburg 
with you know computer engineering 
oh yeah 
what year 
uh just finished up my fourth semester 
well great 
yeah 
yeah 
i hope that works out well 
i- 
it 's a big change 
was 
i spent twenty years as a mechanic 
so 
oh did you 
yeah 
well you 've got some experience behind you in the work force 
yeah 
yeah 
are you uh shooting for a bachelor 's now or master 's or what 
i 'm working on a bachelor 's degree 
all right okay 
good 
i 'm working on a bachelor 's degree 
it 'll be compu- 
hope it 's a good program there 
pardon 
hope it 's a good program there 
uh it seems to me from what i 've been able to find out 
yep yeah 
good 
that 's considered a pretty good program 
it 's nice and small which means you know if you do n't get the class this semester then you got to wait three or four se- you know anywhere from two to four semesters to get it again 
hum 
but uh i- it 's worth it once you get it 
well yes 
that 's good 
and probably a good uh student teacher ratio and things 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
most the class is pretty small 
good 
that works out real well 
well i was wondering what if you all were to get a pet like if you were to move into an apartment 
or a house somewhere what would you get 
uh well um first off we 'd probably wind up with a uh cat or maybe a puppy 
um-hum 
uh i 'm partial towards the larger dogs 
um-hum 
um our last we we 've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus 
um-hum 
uh had a hamster or two 
they we- they got to be a lot of fun 
a hamster 
um oh yeah 
uh it 's amazing how much character you can 
you bet 
they tell you our topic 
oh uh pets 
hm you 've got it 
do you have pets 
yes 
we do 
uh my wife and i have a dog that 's soon be eight years old 
and we have a a cat which is uh i guess about five years old 
oh my goodness 
how about you guys 
we have a three dogs and two birds at this point 
three dogs 
and two bir- 
what kind of birds you have 
parakeets 
no kidding 
en- enjoy them 
oh have a ball with them 
you let you let them out and let them fly around everything 
well no 
because my dogs chase them 
oh okay 
so if in order to have the birds not stuffed i have to keep them in their cages 
we 
you know this is like a cruelty joke 
and i apologize if you 're a bird lover 
but uh we had a parakeet and my fault put up our first electric fan and never thought about it 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
knocked that parakeet right right out of the air 
well we had that happen once um 
my son had the bird back in his room 
because it 's his bir- well the first one that we had was his bird 
and i had the ceiling fan put up 
and it the bird got away from him one afternoon 
and i mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall 
i thought oh so much for the bird 
it kill it 
no 
he 's still alive and kicking 
oh that 's 
no it killed ours 
i 'll be darned 
no 
i guess we did n't have it high enough or he did n't get hit in just the right spot 
but it threw him up against the wall you know 
and he slid down the wall 
well speaking of pets i 'll tell you my my kids are older now 
my both of them are either in or out of college 
but but we had for years about five years i guess had a my son had a burmese boa constrictor 
and that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in in length 
oh gosh oh i hate them 
and finally my wife 's wife bless her heart got rid of it because i did n't really like it 
and we also had a 
one year down in florida on a vacation for father 's day my kids years ago maybe uh ten years ago go bought me a skunk from a like exotic pet shop 
it 'd be like it 'd had been like deactivated as far as uh smell and everything 
oh my goodness 
and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years 
and and my son left went to school 
we finally sold his boa constrictor 
but my son needed some money 
and we we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars 
you 're kidding 
so ah so when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk 
so i made him a deal 
i said you take that skunk 
and he said i 'll sell that snake to you for two fifty 
i said otherwise i 'm going to give it to this other man 
so he took the skunk too 
and the skunk was a good a decent pet 
but you know it does its little jobbies in the litter box 
and 
oh well that 's pretty good 
and it was sort of a neat 
but they just stink too much 
oh yeah 
oh yeah 
that was sort of fun you 
i tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover 
i used to visualize my wife for 
many times my wife be lying there on the sofa 
and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with with its with its head right on her neck and the skunk would be sitting at her feet 
oh you 're kidding 
oh 
that the cat would be on the back of the sofa 
and a dog be running around crazy 
oh my gosh 
i can not ima- 
i just i do n't 
do m- in fact my brother has a uh a exotic pet shop out in california 
and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail you know 
i 'm going do n't do that because they wo n't come in my house 
oh oh gosh 
oh my son bought this snake uh 
someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school 
and it was just a small thing then 
but it got to be pretty big 
and you know you 'd feed it you put and feed him that small mice to big rats and things like that and it 's just uh too much 
uh-huh 
that snake used to watch our cat walk around 
i always told my wife 
i said you know what your friend 's going to get our cat one of these days 
oh my gosh 
yeah that 's right oh my gosh 
that is wild 
oh i just can n't do those and the lizards and the all of those things 
oh oh me neither 
ugh the- they need to stay outside far away from me 
we 're down to a simple dog and cat now 
and that 's the way it should be 
and 
yeah 
have n't had any parakeets for quite a while 
or birds 
uh customer of mine has a parrot 
and uh gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot 
and that was just mind boggling 
oh yeah 
they are so expensive 
well my son was just dying for a bird 
and i 'm really allergic to them 
so i i tried to stay away from them except i 've gotten real attached to this one 
are you 
and and uh we went down to canton one time oh gosh two or three years ago now 
uh-huh 
and he 'd saved up his allowance you know and picked him out a bird and a bird cage 
and and that stinking bird when i brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you clamped onto my finger and would no- 
yes 
i mean i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage 
and he has tried to bite me for two years 
and all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends 
oh gosh 
he 'll gives me kisses 
he talks now and it 's just hysterical 
that 's neat 
i 'm the only one that pays attention to him 
why sure 
and i 'm a substitute teacher 
and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said my mom 's making me get rid of the bird 
we have too many pets 
i thought yeah right come tell me about it you know 
come to my menagerie 
they knew the sucker when they saw one 
so now we have two parakeets 
and they 're talking about uh federal government are n't they 
i 'm sure 
well actually probably any government 
but the federal one 's the big one 
hm 
so uh so what do you what do you think in the short term we should be doing to to improve it 
well i saw a program on it recently 
and and it said everywh- time they cut you know like fifty five million dollars on a certain thing then they brag about how much money they cut 
and then they go and spend that money somewhere else and that 's why the budget is never balanced 
right 
right 
the gramm rudman act did n't solve the problem 
they just take all the money that they say they cut 
and they spend it somewhere else or they you know they pad out their staff or you know spend it in bounced checks at the commissary 
yeah 
or 
huh ah yeah 
i 'm getting pretty kind of disgusted with the uh um the you know the fact that they 're counting um a reduced deficit as being some big step 
right 
i mean first of all we 're we 're we were about ready to hit the largest defi- i mean this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever 
and two a deficit is i mean the deficit is only uh is as as far from a balanced budget 
you reduce the deficit 
you you 're still not you 're still not you 're still overspending 
um-hum 
right 
i mean it 's it 's just the amount that you 're overspending 
and and this is you know and for some reason uh the way that the reporting is going on now 
it seems like like the uh the goal is to reduce the deficit to some you know still outrageous amount um 
yeah 
i i i think in the long term something is going to have to be done with uh sort of the the uh 
well i mean it 's it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you 've got um people you know trying to trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected 
um-hum 
and uh there is n't any sort of overall accountability 
and and uh i do n't know 
i gue- i suppose that that that the only kind of solution ultimately that we 're going to have is is is exposure and information 
and and i do n't know that that in in general the american people are that interested you know to listen to to as much uh uh you know 
i mean you 're going to have to know what people are doing and uh you know and how and how how partisan and how and how self interested their their motives are and and take it to task for it because uh it 's not going to get solved if you know if people are still trying to you know 
um-hum 
like besides like you were saying you said you know where you uh hey we just you know we just cut defense 
let me grab some of this money for my state now 
and then we can throw in some highway bill 
or we can throw in some you know some other kind of thing 
and uh it 's a pretty vicious uh vicious cycle 
i do n't know 
well i think they should they should limit the senate to one term one six year term 
that 
yeah 
that 's being batted around 
i uh my my dad was always a pro- a proponent of that 
he uh he felt that that would get people involved who were who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants 
um-hum 
right 
and and do n't let them come back 
and and uh keep congress to um two terms and two years a piece and then it 'll be overturning 
yeah 
and they wo n't have the same people there all the time and then all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks 
yeah right 
right 
and and that 'll keep them busy enough so that they wo n't have as much influence 
uh-huh 
and because that 's one of the things one of the biggest things is that um the fact that they 're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or ano- whether it 's the oil companies or the automotive companies and like the air bag thing 
the air bag came out what twenty years ago 
right 
and only now they 're getting it put in cars 
uh-huh 
yeah 
you know and the oil companies are n't really are n't responsible you know 
the valdez proved that 
and then the government does n't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything 
right 
it should 've been done immediately 
yeah 
yeah 
i think i think that that 's probably right 
because in terms of long term you you just got to get people um 
i mean at one point at least on a local level um going into politics is you know what you 're doing is is really trying to serve the community right 
um-hum 
i mean you do n't expect to make any money out of it 
you know maybe you gain a little bit of local fame 
but but it 's uh you put in a lot of work in exchange for that 
right 
and and i do n't have the feeling that national level politicians are are at all like that 
no 
they listen to wherever the money is 
you know yeah 
and uh you know and i think that the the the problem with having you know junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with uh you know with in- inept politicians or people who do n't know how to deal with the 
right 
yeah 
they 're not as efficient 
that 's for sure 
pub- but on the other hand maybe that 's in a lot of them 
nancy do you have any children 
yes 
i have a twelve year old 
and i 've been very lucky 
i have n't needed child care except for my mom 
so 
oh 
i 've been real lucky 
i 'm a nurse 
i go to school i mean i go to work early 
so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for his school or just hangs by while she gets ready drives her to school 
um-hum well that 's nice 
then i 'm home to pick her up 
so i 'm very very lucky 
that is lucky 
well how old um does a child have to be before you have to you get to stop making arrangements for him i wonder 
well i could do it now 
um-hum 
but she gets lonely in the morning 
uh-huh 
and i feel better 
um she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just do n't let her out of my sight 
so um you never know 
well and um it 's nice for them not to be alone 
yeah 
yeah 
she feels that way you know 
and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with 
uh-huh 
but we just feel better doing it this way 
so i do n't know what day we 'll stop 
that is a 
we we were about to stop one day this year 
and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats 
and so we did n't stop 
rule oh no 
and so so um you know it you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen 
so even though she 's twelve she 's still a kid 
yes 
so you got to be careful 
she is 
well i 'm glad you had that um opportunity to have your mom 
yeah 
i 'm i 'm glad too 
well i i have two kids and uh five and six a girl and a boy 
uh-huh 
and um so far i have n't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because um i 'm at home now full time 
uh-huh 
but um when i was going to school i would go to school a time that my husband was n't you know when he was at home so that we would just switch back and forth like that 
yeah 
but um it 's really scary 
and i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care 
well i would too because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside we 're finding out now that it 's not always on the inside and and i i just do n't know what i would do if i had to do that 
um-hum 
no 
i know the hospital that i work in is big hospital 
and they provide child care 
and of course they charge for it but at least all the nurses can leave their children 
um-hum 
and they 're always watching them 
they can eat lunch with them 
if they feel sick they can call them at work 
and they run over and check on them 
and they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way 
um 
so 
well that 's nice 
yeah 
it is nice 
and i know that i have um done some babysitting myself and uh when i was in school and needed extra money 
and i know how i feel how i felt as a provider of child care that even though you 're you 're taking care of someone else 's child and you 're forcing yourself to you know treat them equally and you know better usually better than your own um it 's not the same 
right 
right 
and it made me realize that um no one will love your child as much as you and your mother your and um the family 
well that 's right 
yeah 
right 
and no one will look out after them 
and i just think um so far i think my preference would be rather than to have like a oh a big day care that um what is that like chil- kindercare and things like that rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something i would prefer to have in home care either my own home or a neighbor or something 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
just never know 
i babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced 
and it it was hard to treat her equally with my child 
uh-huh 
they were the same age 
and they played together 
and they were good friends 
but like you said you tend to go more for the other one 's side just because you are responsible 
right 
and so it it got hard 
it is hard 
and my daughter got jealous 
and um it just was n't the same as when they were just playing as friends because she had to be there every day 
no 
so i stopped that after a year because it was difficult to balance it 
no 
so 
and i know um when i pick my kids up from school they want to come home 
and i and i would hate for them to ha- be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation 
they do 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i know 
i know 
so i think uh my preference would be a small small if i had to find day care would be a small someone that i knew 
yeah 
yeah 
well i would rather do without some things and i know that some parents they both do have to work 
um-hum 
but a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better 
and i would never do that 
no 
i never have done it 
and i just never would do it 
i would rather do without some things that really are n't very important compared to being with my child when they 're growing up 
so 
well that 's true because even now when they 're gone to school it seems like there 's just not enough time left over in the day 
no there is n't 
there is n't any time 
that 's true 
and uh by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time 
and there 's just not enough to time in the day to do anything good quality for them 
but that 's really 
okay 
yeah 
i 'm sorry speaking of air pollution i 'm coughing 
like a dog now um i 'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly 
i find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution 
yeah 
i- it 
and it just does n't seem like 
but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know 
yeah 
and it it 's kind of dangerous 
yeah 
that 's true 
um-hum 
uh i do n't know 
we live um well i 'm close to salt lake and there 's mountains um you know all around 
um-hum 
but sometimes i i think tend to hold a little bit of it in you know 
oh yeah 
really it 's it 's fairly clean um 
i think it 's a fairly clean city compared to some 
but you have quite a- 
but you think the mountains and the are kind of a barrier 
yeah i think sometimes it seems to be 
hum 
but but uh anyway i do n't know 
that 's a that 's an interesting thought 
i know there 's a lot of plants here 
when i drive down you know along the just along the freeway there 's a lot of plants that they 're burning things 
um-hum 
and 
um-hum um here in texas i know a lot of the pretty much every place here is is relatively flat 
and so i would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a like a smog problem or something like that 
oh uh-huh 
yeah 
we we have a real fog problem um 
i 'm not sure huh 
the last few years just in through december and january it it really it is foggy and seems to just um 
it 's kind of like it it just stays for a month it 's quite foggy 
um-hum 
but uh jeez 
i do n't i do n't know what else 
i- i gue- yeah 
i know cars 
i guess i 've never really uh thought about the fact that like in california they they have a lot of smog problems 
uh-huh 
and it 's real hilly there 
yeah 
so that is probably something that plays a big factor 
i think probably jus- uh a lot of factories um you know they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them i do n't know what you call them and different things like that 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that 's that 's what i see burning a lot 
and i 'm not exactly sure what they 're burning 
i know uh-huh there 's some oil companies 
and and i 'm sure that that contributes a lot just the burning of the che- 
um-hum 
um-hum are n't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of uh special gas or something that does n't emit certain chemicals or something 
oh i do n't know 
i have n't i have n't heard that 
hum 
i know uh 
i do n't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything 
but i know i think they they differ from state to state 
oh okay 
but um you know that 's been a new thing in the last few years 
um-hum 
and i guess some cars are a lot worse than others 
i think those uh 
what are they 
the 
i know 
a a rabbit 's one diesel the diesel cars 
uh-huh 
the diesel 
oh yeah 
yeah 
they they seem to put out quite a bit 
i do n't know a lot of people with diesels unless it 's a truck you know 
huh 
oh 
but uh 
oh well do you um are you working for t i 
no 
i do n't 
oh 
i wor- i work in waco at a tv station 
oh 
so my mother works at ti so 
oh uh-huh 
that 's how 
and that 's how you got involved 
i yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
do you work at t i 
no we we have um 
oh okay 
uh my husband 's sister lives in dallas actually 
okay 
and they kind of got it us involved that way 
oh okay 
yeah but well i do n't i do n't know 
that 's interesting 
what else causes air pollution um 
noise 
much yeah 
noise 
noise causes air pollution 
yeah i 've got 
speaking of noise you can probably hear my little 
and noise pollution yeah 
that 's why i thought of it 
yes 
he 's he is quite noisy 
yes 
jeez 
i do n't know 
i know that um 
do n't dumps you know where you dump all your trash in the they uh 
i thought hum how funny oh 
yeah 
landfills 
yeah 
and i 'm sure that does 
i know they 're always churning that up and i i think they burn a lot there too 
yeah we just 
yeah 
we just had a big uh thing here in waco 
they 're needing to open a new landfill or to expand onto the old landfill 
and uh it it 's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill do n't want it expanded because they 're thinking that their water is going to be contaminated somehow 
i oh 
and so they 
w- yeah i do n't think i 'd i 'd like that 
you know we um when we 've taken things to the dump just the dump that is uh you know closest to us 
yeah 
there 's some houses around there 
um-hum 
and i know that on windy days you know they 're always moving the the trash over to different spots 
oh yeah 
and they 've got those big bulldozers 
and you can see the dust flying 
um-hum 
and and i 'm sure that their homes are really quite dusty 
and one one of the big concerns is they have a there 's a school right across the highway from the landfill 
and 
oh is there 
yeah 
so the parents were really really upset 
worried about the their kids getting huh 
um-hum yeah 
and they 've they 've been fighting over it for the last year 
and they just now approved it 
so they were going to try an appeal or something 
hi 
hi 
i 'm carol 
and i 'm calling from garland texas 
yeah 
uh this is jan noak 
i 'm in dallas 
oh okay 
because yesterday i talked to someone upstate 
i 'm not even sure where 
and my husband talked to people in utah 
so um anyway let me press one 
okay 
okay um 
let me see i think we 've only planned one family reunion in our life 
so we do n't do this too often 
i 
um most of my family 's in california 
but my husband 's is in san antonio 
and so we did this in san antonio 
and um it was an experience that i- i wo n't do again 
how big a family do you have 
um well it was n't that big of a family 
but um it just got out of hand 
and um so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and and um how much um beverages we were going to need and this and that 
and oh it just grew and grew and grew 
and um when the time came only about half that amount of people came 
so it was n't you know 
you have to really just get an accurate amount 
and but overall we all had a good time 
we saw people we had n't see in a while 
so 
did you have people coming from far away 
no 
it was all in the san antonio area 
uh sometimes 
but it it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing 
and we 're going oh my gosh 
so 
it 's well you have you have 
family lives too close together 
they see each other too often they uh they do n't take that kind of thing seriously 
uh-huh 
basically 
yeah 
and if uh they they come from far away it 's uh it it they take it more seriously 
yeah 
uh-huh 
i think you 're right 
yeah 
yeah 
my family 's not very big 
but uh we 're kind of 
your family 's from where 
well i have a a a brother lives in indianapolis a sister lives in chicago 
and my folks live back in buffalo new york 
oh no 
uh i- i guess we have reunions about once a year or so 
uh-huh 
we got together over christmas 
my wife 's family they 're they 're all in up- most of them are in upstate new york 
they have regular uh regular family reunions every summer 
oh those are nice 
and it 's yeah 
it is 
and i 'm i 'm sure they 're a lot more organized too because they 've done it before 
it 's uh yeah 
and it 's it 's just something that they they plan on doing every summer 
they just have a weekend picnic 
that 's great 
and uh every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening and they just plan on being there 
oh 
yeah 
that makes a big difference too 
when everybody 's real eager to participate 
yeah 
well that 's great 
yeah 
they they had a family reunion for uh well for my mother-in-law at her seventy fifth birthday 
and they managed to get just about everybody everybody into town uh last november including a a number of people from out in california 
uh-huh 
oh 
so is uh it it was good 
it uh it worked out very we- 
um-hum 
one in- interesting thing that they did at the time is they um they videotaped the the whole shebang which 
uh-huh 
it made a nice remembrance of of the entire party 
yeah 
people want to come back again 
yeah 
they want to come back 
yeah 
that 's good 
so so that that works pretty well that way 
my uh my grandmother in california is um 
which is my dad 's part side of the family is planning a reunion um this spring 
but we wo n't be going because um i do n't know how they thought of this it 's going to be on a cruise 
and um it seems like most of the family is uh going you know 
all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are g- most of them are going 
but it 's too costly for us 
but anyway they 're going to go on a cruise 
and um it sounds really neat 
it really does 
yeah 
i- i can go for that 
that what what the 
i- i guess interesting if you had uh uh a very extended family that that kind of involved a lot of people that that cousins and things that you you do n't really know that you 've never met 
uh-huh 
it it be interesting to meet a lot of those people 
yeah 
uh i do n't know how you would go about uh getting them together 
but that uh would be uh 
and a friend of mine um she plans her family reunion um every year 
and they go camping 
and she says they have the greatest time 
and she says usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person 
but she said they all go camping 
and they have a really good time for the whole weekend 
so that 's 
yeah 
i kind of wonder what what kind of tradition we 're going to establish for our family you know 
i had hoped that our our kids get together uh at least regularly 
yeah 
yeah 
right now we only have two children 
so i 
okay 
now then you heard the question 
what what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs 
um-hum 
well i 'll tell you i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on than i do now 
okay 
i do uh i do the easy stuff now 
i- i change oil 
uh and then what some people would consider a little more difficult i i 'll change spark plugs 
and i 'll change you know points and y- you know th- air filters that kind of stuff 
um 
well 
but uh i can n't do as much as i used to 
um i used to do a whole lot more but not anymore 
they 're just too weird to work on now 
is that the reason you 're not doing it 
or are you so busy you do n't have time to do it 
well that 's part of it yeah 
hm 
part of it is like you said i do n't have time 
well okay 
well being a female and being alone you i do n't do anything but put gasoline in my car and let someone else check the oil even 
um-hum 
but um have you had any major repairs recently 
well um on this car i 've got now no 
but i had a van before 
and it was only two years old 
and it had transmission go out on it 
oh 
but fortunately that was covered under the warranty 
okay 
well you should be v- feel very fortunate 
i had um have a transmission replaced in an eighty six automobile and i 'll declare that 's an expensive 
hm 
oh yeah 
yes 
um-hum 
maybe i should have just traded the car in 
yeah 
sometimes it makes me wonder 
oh it just 
well i have a very comfortable car and i have a health problem that i need a large comfortable car 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so um anyway i have a new transmission 
and i 'm sure that any of them would have cost al- or charged me almost the same amount 
but it hurts it hurts real bad 
yeah 
did you take it to a dealership 
no 
i took it to an independent out in garland 
um-hum 
oh i see 
i had um 
these people were recommended by a neighbor and you know that 's the only thing 
uh-huh 
i am not a native of dallas 
oh i see 
so that means i have to depend on on trustworthy friends and that 's 
right 
anyway it 's fixed 
it 's running 
and i pray that i get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it 
oh gosh 
um um-hum 
it 's going to have to run for a li- for a while yet 
oh i know it 
uh-huh it certainly is frightening 
what work are you in 
uh i- i work for ti 
oh 
i- i work in the networking area 
okay 
okay 
do you work for ti 
no 
no 
okay 
no 
i have just retired from um the southwest medical center 
oh 
yeah where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car 
but they 're all too busy 
so 
yeah 
i have to do it the other way 
and that 's find someone and pay them to do it 
yeah 
yeah 
so i certainly hope you have a nice new year 
oh yeah 
i 'm i 'm planning on it 
oh it can n't be any worse than last year 
that 's for sure 
oh it could be 
but i do n't much think so 
yeah 
that 's true 
that 's true 
i 'm well we 're starting out a new one 
so let 's make it a good one 
yeah 
i 'm going to try and plan on it 
okay 
all right well i enjoyed the conversation 
thank you 
all right thank you 
all 
right bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
uh do you live in a home 
yes 
uh-huh 
we we it 's a house we bought uh about two and a half years ago now 
oh did you 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
the first house 
we 've we 've lived in ours for about six years 
we had it built actually 
uh-huh 
and um yeah it it 's our first home too 
uh-huh 
yeah 
so what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to to renting somebody else 's 
huh um well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in 
huh 
and um that was quite an experience 
i- i much prefer having my own home and and uh just the space and and more privacy 
yeah um-hum 
yeah 
do you have is it a fairly large house 
um it 's uh oh it 's like twenty four fifty square feet 
oh that 's a pretty good size 
yeah 
it 's a two story 
uh-huh 
yeah 
how about yours 
it 's tiny 
is it small 
it 's not much bigger 
actually we had an apartment two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is 
so 
oh really 
yeah 
it 's uh it 's only like eleven hundred square feet 
oh uh-huh 
do you do you have children 
just one 
just one 
yeah 
huh oh 
but it it uh all the rooms are small i- i mean 
but it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted yeah and uh use an extra one for an office which is handy 
oh uh-huh 
yeah 
i 'd rather have have more rooms and less space in each one i guess rather have lots of rooms and lot- lots of space 
but uh that ends up costing me 
oh yeah 
yeah 
well like um how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood 
well they 're the it 's pretty typical i mean it 's it 's a very very middle class neighborhood 
uh lots of lots of young couples with you know us- oh 
i 'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that 's their first homes and uh lots of kids and and stuff 
oh uh-huh 
and so it it fits well in the neighborhood 
it 's it 's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood 
but on the other hand it 's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than i want 
yeah 
yeah 
is is yours also pretty much in conformance with a neighborhood or is it 
uh 
um yeah 
it it it it does it it seems about oh probably average um 
uh-huh 
that our neighborhood has a just a wide variety of of um people 
and you know there 's older people here and and um people that are ab- our age 
we 're in our thirties 
uh-huh 
and um there 's a lot of kids a lot of kids 
peo- the people across the street have eight 
uh-huh 
wow eight kids 
yeah uh-huh 
oh my gosh 
yeah 
their home just burned down matter of fact and um last summer 
ooh 
and they 're just rebuilding 
and um their house is going to be really big 
they 're 
i 'm sure with eight 
gosh 
yeah 
they 're building it up bigger 
he 's at um uh oh not an obstetrician an an orthopedic surgeon 
uh-huh 
and um so since the house did burn they 're they 're going 
it 's quite different than it was before 
and it 's it 's a lot bigger 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and um but ours is about 
it 's you know it 's a ni- nice home 
it 's it 's definitely not one of the the smaller ones 
and um it 's not the biggest either 
but 
yeah 
neighborhoods i mean they 'll they 'll they 'll tend to to be real tight about that uh especially newer neighborhoods 
my my brother just built a new house 
uh um he he lives in wichita kansas 
and the um uh the neighborhood actually fought him on it 
because he he was um the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood 
oh 
now that 's because he was he 's doing a lot of it himself and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff 
yeah 
and his house actually ends up being nicer than lots of other in the neighborhood 
but but they were they were pretty touchy on it 
yeah 
y- 
he was a little surprised 
you know that 's interesting 
you say that because we do have we have those architectural codes here and when we um put our house in um they wanted us to have 
uh-huh 
there was one 
we have part siding i- o- on the two story part and then on the back 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
and they there was one side where our chimney was 
and just the chimney was going to be brick 
and they wanted us to have more brick 
so we ended up having to go halfway up which it does look nicer 
uh-huh 
and you know we would have liked to have had all brick 
but of course at that point we could n't afford it 
and but it 's funny that you 'd say that because there were homes in here that did n't have any brick at all 
right 
so it 's kind of like they were 
kind of depends on when they get in you know 
yeah 
yeah 
and i and so it was kind of like it 's they 
ours is the last street that they built on 
so the houses actually on our street are a little bit they 've kind of gone a little bit nicer 
um-hum oh they have 
it 's got 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean just they you know 
yeah 
oh 
it 's like the second phase and and so they 've kind of changed the the codes a little bit 
uh-huh 
and so that 's kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that did n't have any 
hum 
well my see my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they they moved into a neighborhood and bought a a real nice stone house down in in south austin 
an- oh uh-huh 
and um and what the builder apparently plans to do is they they do phase one 
and they they kind of give it a very upscale and and very tightly controlled um codes and and and stuff 
and then they come back in 
and and and then they sell 
okay 
yeah right 
um we have small children two and four and so we our dining is very limited 
uh-huh 
i bet you 're a mcdonald 's fan 
oh we 're past that now 
we 're a little sick of that 
are you 
gosh where do you go whataburger 
no 
um we 're more 
like um you know like wyatt 's cafeteria 
oh is that right 
yeah 
that way 
and the kids just love everything that 's there 
so we 're pretty fortunate 
kind of um buffet style um 
so you can go in and go out 
yeah 
that 's that 's good 
and the food 's already served 
and you do n't have to wait 
and and it 's already in front of them when you sit down 
and things like um super salads you know 
it 's again it 's buffet 
and it 's already prepared 
and just things any any eating area that you just do n't have to wait uh an extreme amount of time 
i can understand that 
we 
we 've had we got three kids too 
and uh when the kids are small if you 're going to wait you do n't go out 
no 
they wo n't put up with that 
we tried a bennigan 's one time 
and it was terrible 
course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyways 
we we waited almost oh forty five minutes before everything was brought out 
and it was we were ready to go home 
stuff uh and y- and you had your kids with you 
yeah 
and they waited forty five minutes 
no 
we fought with them for forty five minutes 
i do n't doubt that one bit 
yeah so we we we rarely go eat in those kind of eating uh situations any more 
but we do love to eat out 
and um and we do it as often as we can 
and and times that we do have baby sitters we we try and catch um some things that we normally would n't do yeah 
where where do you like to go when you got a baby sitter 
oh um let me see uh for new year 's we went to eat at uncle julio 's 
where 's that 
i never heard of that place 
it 's um on walnut and greenville 
what 's the name of that again 
it 's called uncle julio 's 
what what are the what kind of 
um basically mexican food 
food yeah 
okay 
and it 's supposed to be very similar to um uh 
what is that restaurant off of central 
it 's a um it 's a mexican restaurant off of central 
oh there 's a zillion of them 
you ever been to mercado juarez 
like no 
but i 've heard about it

i 
really 
they got one in addison too now 
but the original was on northwest highway uh just the other s- west of loop twelve 
that 's a good mexican place 
really 
um-hum 
good good prices good good food there 
yeah 
if you like mexican stuff it 's it 's a good place 
we like um seafood also 
and um 
y- y- you ever been to vincent 's

we have n't 
that 's a good seafood place 
really 
yeah 
really

no 
well this is in plano 
they might have another one 
but it 's on uh parker and central expressway and you know it 's it 's ca- 
uh-huh 
okay 
i 've seen it 
yeah 
it 's cajun type stuff 
yeah 
if you like it kind of hot that that is good food 
yeah 
that 's good stuff 
we 've been to um chefalia 's 
that 's it 's basically the same thing seafood cajun style 
yeah 
where 's that place 
that 's in addison off of belt line 
yeah 
okay 
midway 
belt line and what 
like around i think it 's a little past or it 's right before midway or it 's right at midway 
i get o- okay 
yeah 
okay 
and um excellent food 
um-hum 
so 
we got this premier dining card thing 
and we 've we 've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it 
what what is that 
well you get uh one free 
and you you you pay for one now and type thing 
oh really 
and uh we 've been to from barbecue to 
oh 
there 's a swan club which is off central and campbell 
uh-huh 
uh that is if you like continental stuff that is really nice 
talk talk your husband into taking you there some night 
uh-huh 
i mean it 's not a cheap place 
but uh it 's very nice 
really 
and where is that 
you know uh it 's on campbell it it 's north of campbell but uh off central uh oh it used to be a northern telecom building in the ba- in the ground floor 
uh-huh 
i do n't know what they call it now 
northern telecom kind of moved over in their own building 
yeah 
but it it 's a big tall it 's tallest building on the west side northwest side of campbell and just before you get to campbell and it 's in the lower floor 
uh-huh 
but really a nice restaurant if you if you like continental stuff 
really 
uh-huh 
have him tell him to take you there for your anniversary 
and then they got a place where you can dance you know and all that kind of stuff 
yeah 
well my birthday 's coming up 
so 
there you go 
all right 
you got one coming 
i need an excuse 
you ever been to ewaldes 
now there 's if you like cont- 
i i like continental stuff myself 
uh-huh 
my wife does n't necessarily like that stuff 
but i- i like that 
uh-huh 
and that 's down in uh the stoneleigh hotel now 
uh-huh 
and that is really super kind of stuff too take if if you like continental at all i mean and that kind of stuff either one of those two you go through a hundred bucks without half trying 
yeah 
yeah 
but it it 's it 's it 's nice really nice place 
oh 
yeah 
oh you do n't have to spend that much 
i 'm kidding you but i mean 
uh we have a sheltie collie a miniature sheltie 
do you 
yeah 
it 's about oh about six months old 
and we 're try- 
we 're w- we live in an apartment 
so we do n't have a yard 
so it has to s- s- stay inside 
and we 're having a difficult time trying to train it 
how old is it 
it 's about six months 
uh you you 're you 're in the roughest stages of pet ownership i think 
really 
but they 're supposed to be real intelligent dogs 
but i guess every one one every one one of them or or every once in a while you get one that 's not so intelligent because this one is n't 
well i do n't i do n't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the the the training bit uh 
i 've had dogs through the years 
right now i 've got two and three cats 
but uh and uh my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a sheltie mix 
and we watched it this summer for two to three months 
and it was n't trained quite fully either and uh but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog 
um-hum 
yeah 
so how 'd y 'all how do you 
what 's the best method 
i do n't know 
i i 'm old fashioned 
and when i got my my dogs when they when they did something i hollered at them and threw them outside 
right 
they say that 's not the way to do it now 
but you 're just supposed to no 
stand outside with them until they 
just just y- put them outside i guess unless you ca- catch them in the act 
well we 're hardly ever at home 
so it 's kind of difficult 
yeah 
and you know you do n't want to you do n't want to spank it or scare it or anything like that 
so 
no 
y- no 
you do n't want to do that 
but uh 
yeah 
we we try to take it you know 
it gets it gets frustrating when you take it outside 
and you know and then it runs right inside 
d- d- does it just want to sniff around 
and it does it huh 
and does it just want to sniff around and play when it 's outside 
yeah 
a lot of times 
and you know it it wo n't it 's whole job outside 
yeah 
and it comes inside 
ha- have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside 
uh yeah 
we 've tried that 
and uh you know there 's certain spots in the house where he likes to go 
yeah 
so and he chews on plants and all that 
but you know that 's natural for a little puppy huh 
that 's nothing huh 
well it it it 'll it 'll catch on pretty soon i 'll i 'll i 'll betcha 
i i have a sixteen year old almost sixteen year old golden retriever 
and she 's gone the other way 
because she 's so old she does n't have much control so we 're battling with that problem and she still feels good 
oh really 
oh that 's sad 
uh she can n't hear worth a darn or see very well 
but she 's got a great appetite 
and she knows we 're there by smell 
huh how old is it 
she 'll be sixteen in may 
man that 's sad 
and yeah 
but we can n't bear to do anything because she 's been our friend for all these years 
oh of course not 
so we 're putting up with all her accidents 
i could n't 
and the la- 
two nights ago she had diarrhea 
and so that was a bad one 
but uh i think we 're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend 
that is really sad 
what what 's the deal 
w- we try to we 're trying to take it on walks now you know and we can n't because it 's not accustomed to being on a leash and so it i mean this dog really feels like it 's being killed or something when you try to you know tug on it to walk it 
um-hum 
yeah 
i mean it just goes like a mad dog 
i mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping 
and it 's you know i mean it 's not even close to even being trained on a leash 
does it oh 
uh-huh 
uh you know maybe you nee- you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes 
um-hum 
well we 've heard bad we 've heard some bad things about some of those you know 
they sometimes mis- misuse their license or whatever you know 
oh 
and they treat them bad 
well you know where we went we went to the junior college richland and we took 
oh really 
my my daughter was living at home then 
and she took our golden retriever or not the golden retriever the norwegian elk hound over there and it it it 's a pretty good class 
oh really 
and they did pretty good except this dog is 
she 's just pretty 
she 's not smart 
uh-huh 
so she did n't learn a lot 
but it i think it calmed her down a little bit 
and she 's used to being around other dogs now 
how long did it take 
i think it was like a six week program 
every what 
uh i think it was one night a week for like six weeks 
oh really 
and uh you know it was a group class outside 
it was fairly reasonable too 
well sheltie collies are you know timid 
and they do n't really 
unless they get used to something they 're really nervous 
and 
yeah 
they 're pr- they 're usually a high strung dog are n't they 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh if they 're not accustomed to something they they 're really scared 
so 
um our our friend has a 
all right 
um exercise huh 
yeah 
um as a matter fact i work out in the mornings 
i belong to presidents 
huh yeah uh-huh 
and uh i 've got a routine for every morning of the week 
and i do n't work out on saturday or sunday but uh i do a i do a combination of uh uh running and weight training 
uh-huh 
they set that up for you 
no 
i i actually i just you know joined on my own 
and i 've been thinking about getting with a uh one of their counselors just so see what uh what they might have to offer as far as you know alternatives 
uh-huh 
but i pretty much uh worked on my own routine 
and uh what kind of running do you do 
they 've got the track on the inside 
uh-huh 
and uh i run one mile on monday wednesdays and fridays 
and then on tuesdays and thursdays i run two miles 
um-hum 
and then after that i work out with weights 
is it just aerobic 
or 
uh and i work out with free weights 
no 
i mean the running 
oh uh yeah 
it 's really uh aerobic work out part 
you do it you do a mile in about eight minutes or less 
uh about seven minutes 
uh-huh 
and 
then you would n't then you do n't get um out of breath 
uh no 
i do 
oh 
yeah 
that 's that 's a pretty good pretty good clip 
and i 'll be i 'm pretty winded by the time i get done 
oh 
so 
but i mean he 's just not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that 
oh yeah 
i- i could i could probably go faster 
but then i 'd wear myself out 
yeah right 
and i would n't be able to work out anything else 
yeah uh-huh 
yeah 
how about you 
yeah 
i- i do n't run much any more 
i did when i was in school 
um-hum 
i right now i just lift um weights and and do push ups and sit ups and and i jump rope a little bit and that 's about it 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
and i do n't i do n't lift any heavy weights uh 
they 're about a third of my body weight 
oh i see 
so just uh 
just try and keep them uh i guess uh firm and 
yeah 
and um um i play the trumpet 
and uh the more upper body strength the easier it is to play 
yeah 
yeah that 's true 
you you have to do a you have to do a whole lot of sit ups 
and uh and then i- i hurt my neck uh about three years ago 
um-hum hm yeah 
so you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from um hurting yourself when you play high 
oh i see 
you have to you have to do it correctly it 's you know 
it 's like an exercise in itself 
but a lot of people uh strain themselves doing it 
i see um-hum oh i see 
uh so you 're in uh in part of a band 
um i play at church 
oh i see 
i see 
i used to play an instrument when i was in in high school 
but it was n't the trumpet 
and um-hum yeah well yeah 
so i was just wondering if that 's what it was or something 
i see 
so you you have any plans of maybe r- running more when the weather gets nicer 
well yeah 
well the weather 's nice except for when it rains you know i mean in dallas 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i keep thinking about it 
but that does n't that does n't get it done 
i- i- i mostly jump rope more 
um-hum 
you know 
yeah 
i used to do a little bit of jumping rope and uh when i was uh 
a while back i was more into basketball and uh i used to do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
and uh but it 's been a while since i 've done that 
yeah 
i- i do a toe lift and squats for that 
i see right 
but you know i it it does n't um it does n't um accustom your your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you 're running for a long time 
right 
they they tend to tighten up whenever you whenever you have to do something at a at a great length of time 
um-hum 
yeah 
i- i that 's true 
i 've noticed that uh 
and it also builds too much mass if you just you know 
um-hum 
so and it 's like i- i lift weights with about the the same curl weight as i do the squats with 
uh-huh 
and um then it does n't bother me very much 
yeah 
yeah 
huh that 's that 's interesting though 
i you know i 've been thinking of changing 
i 've done the same routine for almost two years now 
and i 'm thinking it of changing it up 
um-hum 
uh that 's why well you know i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and see what different exercises they could get me on to get out of the routine 
right 
because i 've heard that you know you get locked into routines and you 're going to hit this up point where you just stop developing 
um-hum 
so i 'm looking at changing things a little bit 
yeah 
that 's i- i started doing more push ups 
and it it 's helped a lot 
and then i add sets to it so that i do n't like you said wear it out 
um-hum 
i do n't try to push it to the end in one set 
yeah 
any vacations recently that you would highly recommend 
well that is like my favorite hobby 
oh really 
so yeah 
i travel everywhere 
and i 've been all over europe and a lot of the united states and hawaii 
oh wow 
and so when i can that 's what i do 
wow 
uh-huh 
uh what what has been your favorite trip do you think 
well i 'm not sure 
um i guess hawaii is one of my favorite places 
really 
yeah 
better than europe 
well no 
that 's exciting 
you know i 've been several times 
so after the first time it 's like anywhere 
oh 
you know it loses that newness 
but yeah 
i love it 
i love to go over to europe 
i do 
and mostly i 've traveled through germany and switzerland 
and we have good friends in england 
so i 've been there quite a bit 
um-hum 
and i just love it all 
i love to look at the different people and the different cultures and to see how different things are from the way we do them the most interesting part more than the museums and things like that 
um-hum sure 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so how about you 
yeah 
well uh i have never been i 've been to canada several times 
but uh that is about it for me 
i 'm i 'm from a denver and so uh growing up uh we would spend most of our vacations right there in colorado 
uh-huh 
uh my family is uh uh real into camping and four wheeling 
and so um several 
i- i think maybe uh four summers in a row uh we spent uh our vacation time in the summer uh four wheeling through uh portions of uh the southern half of of colorado 
uh and and uh every time uh my mother had uh uh 
i have two other sisters 
and my mother had us uh do some studying of the the area which we were going to visit 
and then we had to write uh uh reports reports about it during during our vaca- which which was really fun 
oh no 
it was really fun 
we we we each got to write little books 
uh and uh i- it had sparked an interest that uh uh of of mine that uh 
um-hum 
my fiancee is a is a um very very good photographer 
that 's what she had originally gone to school to do was photography and uh i i 'm close to receiving my english degree uh as as well as my my graduate degree 
um-hum 
so so i uh uh we 've thought very seriously of trying to to uh incorporate travel into wri- and and writing a book about uh uh some portion of travel uh 
so we 're hoping soon uh not soon maybe within the next ten years to get to take a trip over from uh over over to europe and take a trip from the northern portion of france uh down to the southern tip of spain uh and follow 
um-hum 
uh it there 's kind of a backward s shape uh trail that the pilgrims use to take uh in in uh back in the medieval times uh to see the relics uh in in southern spain and in italy 
uh-huh 
and so we would like to take pictures of the gothic uh and romanesque uh monasteries and uh just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it 
boy 
that would be quite a project 
yeah 
it would be it 's it 's our big dream 
yeah 
well it would be a lot fun 
you know there 's there 's good and there 's bad 
and my experience in italy was n't my favorite for sure 
but well i flew into milan 
oh su- really 
um-hum 
my daughter is uh a twirling champion and she had to perform over there and in turin 
um-hum 
and so we had to fly into milan 
and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the italians even if they speak english they do n't want to let you know and they gave us all the wrong directions and there were just two of us 
oh sure 
oh 
at the airport they put us on the wrong bus 
but finally we saw a policeman 
he put us on the subway 
uh-huh 
we sat there um 
we did n't know italian 
we looked at each other 
we said things like spaghetti 
uh-huh 
you know things like that 
and we finally followed some kids he told us where to get off 
we followed these kids with uh gym bags 
and we figured that must be the sports arena and we lucked out 
and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground 
i mean it was just it was kind of a nightmare 
wow 
but that was our experience 
and i guess all of italy is n't like that 
but where we were it certainly was 
and the hotel that we stayed in 
we stayed with our english friends their team in the hotel 
and it was beautiful 
it was very modern 
uh-huh 
but it was very far away on a bus 
right um-hum oh 
so you know it was it was really uh it was interesting 
you always learn something 
yeah 
yeah 
and you will always have a fun experience 
so it it 's great you know 
yeah you said you 've been to england several times 
uh-huh 
i wonder 
have you ever been to a uh a small town uh 
well it 's it 's actually about uh thirty minutes from salisbury 
it 's called uh bemerton 
no 
i have n't 
huh-uh 
okay 
our friends live like an hour outside of england like ash around there 
oh okay 
all right 
yeah 
so um-hum 
i- i- i the reason i 'm curious 
um i uh that 's the other place i would like to visit uh mo- 
we could talk about my favorite subject 
cooking and foods huh 
food 
what do you like to cook 
uh i do n't cook a lot actually 
i 've just started baking 
so i 'm kind of interested in cakes and muffins and stuff like that 
but i can n't seem to get them exactly right 
so just trying to perfect some things 
um-hum 
i do n't know i tried to make an apple sauce cake which i will never ever try to make again 
it was horrible 
oh dear 
i do n't know if the cake was horrible or if i made it horrible 
oh probably not 
i have uh a bread recipe that 's real easy that everyone always really does like that uh does n't require kneading the dough 
hum 
oh 
hey 
and it 's oh it is it 's wonderful 
it 's 
and what 's funny is that you use uh bran all bran and it looks like it 's a wheat bread 
um-hum 
hum 
but it 's actually all bran and flour and uh you know it 's regular 
um-hum 
types that you know you use and that sort of and you let it rise 
um-hum 
and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and you can punch it down and then uh make your rolls 
and they really are good and they 're so easy to do 
wow 
um-hum 
that it 
seems like every time that we have a dinner party or that uh we 're going some place where everybody 's supposed to bring something and they 've had my rolls before they always ask me to bring those rolls 
um-hum 
they request it 
i have n't gotten any requests yet 
actually i had a christmas party at uh my office 
and i made the tuna fish sandwiches 
and everyone i mean i 'm i think everyone knows how to make tuna fish 
so that 'd be easy for me to make 
and i can n't go wrong with it 
and so i made it 
and i used celery seed in my 
do you use celery seed in your tuna fish 
no 
i have n't 
uh and i- i just thought it was so strange 
because i 've never i thought that that 's what celery seed was for 
was for tuna fish 
oh how funny 
and so but everyone really really loved the tuna fish 
and they just could n't get over the fact that i used celery in it 
and it just surprised me 
celery and and onion and 
uh-huh well see i i 've always used cele- i mean i 've used celery before 
um-hum 
but i 've never used the celery seed in it 
oh 
yeah 
well what else do you put in it besides the celery seed 
it 's great uh just like um really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed 
and i used like uh miracle whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because i really do n't like may- the helman 's mayonnaise 
um-hum 
but if you use a salad dressing which is kind of uh you know kind of a i guess a tart taste then it comes out really good 
um-hum 
but i wa- uh it was the first time i 've i 've ever found out that that nobody else used celery seed 
i feel so silly 
but 
see i 've never put bell pepper in tuna fish either 
yeah 
is n't that funny 
i was brought up with tuna fish it was made where you put in uh oh chopped hard boiled eggs which it now with no no with cholesterol and uh you know chopped up uh dill pickles and that sort of thing 
i yeah that 's weird um-hum right 
uh-huh oh right 
the standard old tuna fish 
y- yeah 
i would i would put that too 
i just did n't have those things 
um-hum 
like i do n't think i had eggs that night or something 
but i would have put eggs 
i would have put in eggs in there also 
but is n't that interesting 
so you you use bell pepper and onion and celery seed 
but that 's strange 
and celery seed 
i 'll have to try that 
do you use a regular mayonnaise or the sa- the miracle whip 
sometimes i do 
sometimes i use miracle whip 
it depends on what i have 
yeah 
and sometimes if i 'm using like regular mayonnaise to spice it up a little bit i 'll use a little bit of mustard with it 
um-hum 
yeah 
i do that also 
um-hum 
um-hum just to put a little zing in it 
yeah 
but not a bunch 
or 
but enough to make it have a little bit more flavor 
something oh no wha- what else do i like i love barbecue 
anything barbecue i 'll eat 
um-hum i like uh barbecue baby back ribs 
um 
and uh and and they 're so easy to do if you uh have a good barbecue sauce and you just cook them very very slowly in the oven 
um um-hum 
um-hum 
and it 's not hard to cook like some meals are 
yeah 
and it 's not of course it 's messy to eat 
that 's the disadvantage 
hum yeah 
and uh i make lasagna from scratch 
and people really like my lasagna and and so um sometimes i 'm requested to make that 
yeah 
i like to make that too 
i make that once in a while 
or and tha- and that 's not too hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it 
hum it 's not really as long as you have all the ingredients it 's just the layering really and and not breaking the uh the the uh pasta 
um-hum 
yeah 
um-hum 
is the hardest part probably 
but um 
then i have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie 
it just takes forever but it 's uh when the strawberries are nice and big and fresh and yummy 
yeah um 
do you make a cheese cake 
um um-hum 
i do 
but this one is basically it 's like a normal pie crust 
hum um-hum 
but then you use this sort of uh 
it 's a cream cheese um uh layering 
but you use thin it out a little bit uh or make it a little fluffier 
um 
and you put uh line the whole pie crust with that and so it 's sort of like in a way uh using cheese cake 
um-hum 
um 
and you know but but it 's not a real cheese cake 
and then you 
yeah and you just put the strawberries 
okay 
yeah 
donna um you said you have three children 
what uh kinds of activities do you spend with them 
is it 
okay 
um we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old 
and um uh my husband let 's see he coaches basketball with brian um 
you know uh-huh 
so he spends time doing that with him planning and um practicing out side 
uh-huh 
um he 's a real sports kind of person 
so he plays tennis with with the kids 
we all kind of play tennis as a family 
except the baby plays on the play ground 
um-hum 
we take turns with her 
um uh let 's see 
we have a computer 
and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer 
um uh let 's see what else we do 
oh i suppose we watch a little tv together 
we really do n't watch i think as much tv as a lot of people 
um-hum 
we do n't have hbo 
we do get the disney channel for the kids 
uh-huh 
uh my kids have the nintendo which they play 
and my husband sometimes joins them with that 
um-hum 
uh my little girl jennifer likes to do crafty things 
and i 'll take some time and do that with her 
and of course we always read a bed time story at night 
and even the the older kids sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story 
um basically the story person because my husband does n't have 
uh-huh that 's neat 
he gets home from work late or whatever 
and and usually once in a while he 'll read the story to the little one 
but that 's basically my job 
yeah 
um 
so do you find it difficult to find time 
or is it pretty natural 
it is it is hard because you know at the end of your day you want time for yourself and and it 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and that 's kind of cutting into your your time 
yeah 
and with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late 
uh-huh 
but you know on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine 
they go upstairs at nine 
and um now this weekend we 'll have a baby sitter come 
and uh my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and um probably not too late 
um-hum 
may- maybe brian will still be up and spend some time with him 
but it is it 's really hard 
you have to be a very unselfish person to to spend a lot of time with your kids i think 
yeah 
yeah 
do you work during the day 
uh no 
i do n't work 
i last year um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities 
um-hum 
that was two days a week 
and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot 
i do n't know how 
i admire people that that can do it all 
yeah 
but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i i want it kept it is hard 
yeah 
i can imagine 
um 
yeah 
even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything 
um-hum 
and that 's another thing 
i 'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping um usually on the weekend 
and that 's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son 
and and they 'll be my helper 
and then they 'll get to pick out some of the favorite snacks that they get to pick out 
so try to do things like that 
um-hum yeah 
but it you know it 's it 's uh 
yeah 
and then of course they have a pretty um busy social calendar too 
uh-huh 
you fit it in with all that the that 
yeah 
so what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general you know in america 
i i think a lot of people a lot of people sit sit their kids in front of the tv and hbo and rent movies and and kind of leave them to their own means um 
um-hum 
yeah 
i think you know it 's very very easy to fall into that trap 
and i 'm not um totally innocent of that because there 's times when you just stay here watch a tape 
um-hum 
yeah 
but um um i think different parts of the country 
i think in plano and maybe this area in texas there 's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids 
people are real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and 
um-hum 
oh that 's good 
you know but um 
yeah 
yeah 
well families are facing a challenge 
i know that with 
what 
i 'm a newlywed 
and we 're you know thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years 
um-hum 
and 
um-hum 
and it 's it 's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it 's very hard to to cut back to one 
yeah 
and um um but you know if you have the type of job 
i have a friend that 's a nurse 
and she can pick her hours 
and that 's a a great career 
um-hum 
i i wish i would have gone into uh nursing 
yeah 
because she has such a flexible schedule 
but it 's very hard to uh spend time with the children and uh and your husband and do everything at once 
um-hum 
yeah 
but i do feel like it 's important that you make the time for children because 
well i think it 's a big it 's a big um responsibility 
you just do n't have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single 
yeah 
yeah 
when you have children you have to say now this is different 
and you do have to give things up 
i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um for the at least for the first two years of their lives i mean if you can possibly swing it 
um-hum 
yeah 
because they 
okay 
okay 
i was watching the soap opera awards 
oh 
um and and it 's it 's really making me want to exercise 
because every single woman in the audience is about ten pounds 
oh 
so um i started anchoring last up anchoring uh exercising last about last spring when i- i joined the president 's health club 
um-hum 
and i was really motivated and going 
and i went uh for a little while uh 
i went pretty regularly 
but it 's hard to go regularly for a long time 
um-hum 
and where i live in waco uh they do n't have anywhere here that is affiliated with president 's 
so now i do n't have a club 
and i 'm i do n't have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that 
so i 'm not exercising at the time at the moment 
um-hum 
so i wish i could 
i wish i did have the motivation to get out and do that 
but i just do n't like just running with no where to go 
and i just can n't do that 
so 
um-hum well i understand that 
i 've been trying to get myself motivated 
i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh 
she had injured her back and needed a walking partner 
and i thought that 'd be the time to get going 
um-hum 
and uh so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks 
and uh then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to new york 
and so she 's not around 
um 
and i just do n't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning and i do n't seem to find time in the day time 
yeah yeah 
yeah 
and of course it 's motivation that 's keeping me from really looking for that opportunity 
i think a lot of times if you have someone to uh work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation 
oh yeah 
and you can also i mean you can you know pretty much do it privately if you had your own private uh sort of contest you know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
and that would keep you going 
well more than weight 
course i could use uh lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds but i think more than that 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i also notice i just feel better when i exercise 
oh yeah 
and that 's something that i 'm motivated about now because i do need to get myself feeling better and just in better shape 
um-hum 
but i um all the same it 's connected to my attitude 
because i 'm not feeling as perky and good 
i 'm also 
it 's hard to get my attitude to to get myself out there 
that 's very true 
it seems like you walk quicker 
and you just 
perky is a good word for it when you when you exercise 
yeah 
yeah 
and i understand that walking is suppose to be like the best exercise 
better than running 
yeah 
yeah 
things like that 
because it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it it does n't yeah 
and you have l- less chance of of hurting yourself 
it does n't you know hurt you 
like i understand running hurts your shins or knees or something like that 
yeah 
so 
yeah the last time i tried running with my daughter because she 's supposed to be jogging in p e 
and it felt good 
but then i had pulled a muscle in my knee 
actually i hyper extended it or something 
and uh boy 
um-hum wow 
i was suffering for a good three weeks later 
wow 
so and i 'd never had that problem before but i guess age is starting to catch up to me 
yeah 
uh oh 
it 's showing up in the weirdest places 
huh i guess my f- my favorite exercise in the uh in the gym is the bikes 
oh is it 
to go 
yeah 
jus- with the the stationary bikes to just ride 
and if you 're watching television they usually have television in there or something or if you 're listening to a walkman it 's pretty it 's pretty okay 
again that 's sort of weird because you 're you 've not going anywhere 
and i- i- i used to play racquetball and i really loved that because though it to me it had a point 
yeah yeah uh-huh 
yeah 
you know it was there was points you could you you would make 
and you know there was a point to it 
but running and jogging and just not going anywhere it 's just 
because i do n't 
i just can n't understand that 
so i do n't do 
yeah 
well i 've got a dog now 
and and of course she needs walking and so that 's a little less try you kn- uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her 
it oh yeah 
um-hum 
and i do put on the earphones to have something to listen to 
and 
hum yeah 
i know a lot of people just to be safe 
like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning early in the morning um 
yeah 
you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls 
oh yeah 
you know like early in the mornings things like tha- 
i never tried that 
yeah 
i do n't know 
i 've i never really even thought about it really 
that 's kind of an idea 
uh we we have uh over here in plano a little recreation center that 's got a walking track 
that is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it anytime of the year 
but i find it very tedious because i 'm watching the clock constantly 
and it 's just nothing else to look at 
oh 
and i actually get more tired doing that than 
i could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good 
and there i could barely make a couple miles 
okay 
your family have reunions on any regular basis 
have you ever probably once every five years 
once every five years 
um-hum 
yeah 
um you have a pretty big family 
yeah 
and the hardest part about getting the fam- the stuff together 
is everyone 's spread out all over timbuktu 
oh yeah 
and you 
yeah 
we 've got a pretty big family 
but most of us 
l- well i 'm we- i 'm originally from west virginia 
um-hum 
most of the family is right in the west virginia a- uh what they call the tristate area uh northern west virginia eastern ohio and s- southwestern pennsylvania 
yeah 
most everybody is right in that area 
that makes it a lot easier 
a lot more convenient 
that 's why we only do it once every five or ten years 
yeah 
because it 's like that hard to get everyone together 
yeah 
they put one together for our family about once every june 
it was on my grandmother 's birthday 
but she 's she 's gone now 
yeah 
see that 's kind of what happened with ours 
that 's why we had n't had one in a long time 
yeah 
um 
so so to make one successful wh- i mean what do y 'all do 
oh 
do y 'all just start planning real far ahead of time 
shoot pardon 
d- y- um do y 'all start planning real far ahead of time 
well no 
there 's kind of a set pattern to it 
there 's uh 
so the day it happens is ninety eight percent of the planning usually 
oh really 
yeah 
oh the we get together at the the uh the park uh the uh park and playground area of the church i was raised in and uh everybody brings lots of food 
yeah 
and we 'll put up a volleyball net just sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat 
eat a lot 
oh goodness 
see it 's a lot harder for us because we 're like i say we 're spread out so they have to plan anywhere from six well really probably a year ahead of time so everyone can s- um their their vacation time 
yeah 
scheduled vacation time 
yeah 
we usually 
just sat- sat- uh sunday afternoon or may- sometimes it 's been like on saturday afternoon 
um-hum 
usually it 's like sunday afternoon 
and most people do n't have more than you know a couple hours drive tops to get there and back 
yeah 
now 
is that where you 're 
i mean is 
well where i 'm calling from is southern mississippi 
so we got a w- uh uh my wife and i have a bit longer ways to go than most 
but y 'all still manage to make them 
uh actually we 've only made one of them since we got married about four years ago one of the family reunions 
yeah 
but we 're both in school 
so it makes it kind of tough 
yeah 
they usually they been happening um just after the summer semester starts 
you can n't really get away 
so usually not 
we managed to get to one 
that was before i started to school 
and she took that summer off 
but uh 
well now that we 've been talking about it i 'm -onna i 'm kind of getting home sick now 
because it 's been over three years since i 've been home to see my grandparents 
oh ye- oh goodness 
or well my my grandfather 's the only one that 's still around 
yeah 
and see my grandmother was the one that used to plan the stuff basically 
yeah 
so unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together it 's kind of like 
she was like the glue 
so 
yeah 
i understand 
where is home for you 
originally um i was born in missouri 
yeah 
so and you know we have relatives scattered out all over louisiana mississippi um here in texas so it 's harder for everyone to get in get home 
yeah 
yeah 
-ell maybe this year you can find a more central location 
n- well but see the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters 
so it 's easier for us few stragglers to go home 
oh okay 
okay the majority of them are still in the missouri area 
yeah 
okay 
yeah our family right now or most th- th- there 's only l- few stragglers uh if any with any distance 
-eah some of u- -ere 's one cousin uh in colorado and uh some cousins over in phoenix uh 
i got a sister over in in uh washington state 
uh rest of them are within you know a couple hours drive 
we- we- um how do y 'all communicate like to plan it and everything 
do y 'all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we 're going to do it 
or do y 'all like mail out stuff 
that 's pretty much it 
yeah 
okay it 's going to be such and such a weekend 
and uh y 'all come 
yeah 
that 's about it 
i mean you know this is the standard pattern 
is the 
everybody brings their their favorite dish 
and somebody brings the volleyball net 
somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon 
and 
we- um i guess probably the last one i went to i met so many people that i had n't seen in probably ten over ten years 
it was like do n't you remember me 
and i 'm like no 
am i related to you 
yeah 
i know 
yeah 
i married your cousin 's brother 's uncle uh something like that 
do you 
i mean is that since 
y- i mean do you have them every year 
uh yeah 
they 're every year 
and and still you wind up meeting people y- y- you never knew you were related to let alone 
we- see it 's probably not that yeah 
we- i think that 's probably why our 's always so interesting is because we do n't have them that often and then when we do and everyone does finally get together 
yeah yeah down right amazing is n't it 
it 's like after the you know the just like yeah 
uh do you have kids 
oh yeah 
i got three 
how about yourself 
um we have two and another one on the way 
oh you 've got uh young children then 
well we ha- yeah 
we do 
we have a our si- a six year old 
he 's oldest 
and then um our baby will be a year on monday 
oh my goodness 
that 's great 
yeah 
what kind of mix do you have 
a boy and a girl 
yeah two boys 
or two boys 
two boys 
yeah 
you know what 's on the way yet 
are you i do n't blame you 
no 
i i 'm just about three months 
and um i do n't think we really even want to find out 
we like surprises 
so we 'll take either 
we- well well we got two boys and a girl al- 
well we got two boys and a girl 
and and d- does it 
are the two boys first 
well uh yes 
oh

so 
well our boys one is uh he 's in graduate school at a&m uh 
he 's in the navy 
he 's a lieutenant in the navy 
and the navy 's sending him for his master 's in ocean engineering an- we got another boy that 's uh out in maryland

he 's a wildlife biologist uh 
and our girl is thirteen 
she 's in uh seventh grade 
so we got still all sorts o- good activities with

you 've kind of got uh a span there huh 
oh well what do you do with your seventh grader 
with her well she 's into a little bit of everything 
she 's uh loves riding horses 
so she goes out riding as much as she can 
do do you have horses

she must really like them 
yeah 
and yeah she 's into oh

well uh yes 
but uh well they have 
what they well you probably know a pace group that uh they 're advanced type the they 're special uh classes for pace classes

oh that 's neat 
so yeah

i guarantee you 
yeah 
my husband 's going to take our six year old to the monster truck show tonight

he in fact he just goes right out here 
we 've got quite a bit of snow now 
and last week we got a lot 
well you 're welcome to keep that 
yeah 
you do n't like that huh 
well i grew up in wisconsin 
i- i had plenty of snow 
and when i was a kid 
oh 
and we 've lived here about seventeen years 
but we used to take all the kids tobogganing and ice skating and all that kind of stuff the boys and it 's a lot of fun really 
yeah 
it is fun 
as long as you do n't have to drive in it 
yeah 
i 
no 
i do n't like that 
i 
really i it makes me nervous 
yeah 
i had plenty of snow to last me forever 
i- i do n't care if i ever see any 
well i do n't care if i see it 
but -st keep it off of here 
yeah 
yeah 
oh i do n't mind it 
but uh us um the winter gets long 
yes 
you know i get ready if that 
come about this time of year i 'm kind of ready for it to start getting spring 
and it 's too early yet 
well you got you got you got five months before you 'll see that 
so yeah 
we do we do 
we 've had a few early springs though the last few years 
they have n't been too bad 
come about march it it gets you know a lot nicer and yeah 
oh yeah 
our our oldest son when uh 
okay 
what um 
do you watch much tv 
or you know 
um no 
i do n't watch much tv 
sometimes um usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news 
the news 
yeah 
but i do n't think of that every day even 
uh-huh 
um i think i get most of my current events 
well i get them from everywhere 
i sometimes watch tv if i- 
i guess i watch tv if i have n't read the paper that day 
we do n't get a paper 
but i work um at a 
i teach college class 
and uh there 's a 
oh uh-huh 
the library has a paper 
and so i often drop in on a break and and read it 
yeah 
and then i keep the radio on quite a bit when i 'm home 
um-hum 
and then i i figure if there 's big big news i 'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else you know 
yeah 
yeah 
now i also 
i get it from all over 
i watch the news every day 
and i ha- we have a news 
you know we get the newspaper and uh um magazines a- anything 
uh-huh 
you know i 'm 
i read a lot 
so i get 
um you know i 'm i 'm really up on uh current affairs 
i get you know the news and and everything 
uh-huh 
yeah 
what 's your favorite news 
do you do you get a news magazine 
or 
um well i 'm not getting an- 
no 
i 'm not getting any news magazines but um you know a- as i said i do 
uh-huh 
uh it 's uh it 's easy to keep up on current event- you know on cert- you know especially when you um you know you get a paper every day 
yeah 
yeah 
we 've got 
yeah 
yeah 
exactly 
and uh 
are you satisfied with the quality of coverage 
uh i do n't know 
is there anything missing 
i you know 
yeah 
it 's kind of hard to know 
i and i do n't know you know what what 's i mean what what are we supposed to uh compare it to you know i mean the quality uh 
is n't it uh-huh 
whatever they tell you 
you know i uh i guess i 'm uh i you know i 'm satisfied 
i mean i 
uh y- y- you know they 're they 're supposedly covering everything that happens 
so you know 
yeah 
yeah 
well i do feel like a little bit like 
being from california and wanting to hear like 
i 've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there 's been an earthquake or sliding or something 
and i do n't ever hear it in the news here 
oh really 
oh 
you know it 's um 
well uh sometimes it 's such a 
you know it 's it 's so um slight you know like the tremors are so slight that they do n't even bother putting it in the paper 
yeah 
yeah 
but most of the ti- the times i find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there uh you know there 'll be a small article in the paper about it 
yeah yeah 
but um 
yeah 
i sometimes feel like um the dallas paper and the dallas news um the top headlines are always a murder you know 
oh well that 's what sells papers 
and that 's because there 's a high crime rate 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's um that 's been like that since they the first newspaper you know 
yeah 
yeah 
i 'm sure 
you know but um i do n't know 
i- i guess i 'm satisfied 
i do n't uh 
uh-huh 
i mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really 
yeah 
really 
we do n't get a you know 
that 's true 
we certainly get enough coverage 
i mean we w- we can get news 
you know i mean there 's even the c n n channel where we can get world news twenty four hours a day 
oh yeah 
i was going to 
sure 
yeah 
sometimes you do n't even want to be bothered with the news because it 's all so bad 
so yeah 
it 's all so negative you know 
yeah 
often times 
but 
so yeah 
well we have to keep talking i guess 
well no 
i guess we can end 
oh 
yeah 
it 's just whenever we 're um 
oh is it really 
yeah 
have you always gone until the recording 
well yeah 
i do n't i do n't uh 
uh-huh 
oops i guess we 're not supposed to 
i do n't know 
we 're supp- i guess we 're supposed to wait 
or i do n't know 
yeah 
uh-huh 
ca- i 
you know like one well 
was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening uh and it was really funny 
uh-huh 
i i i mixed it made the call 
and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away 
oh really 
yeah 
and it was really 
we were laughing 
i mean but you know we do n't really do any gardening 
so like that took like a minute and then we just talked about you know whatever i mean 
it just uh-huh 
uh-huh 
interesting 
yeah 
you know i mean some topics 
really now you know now this topic this is i mean 
there really is n't much to say after you know you uh you you know you you tell a person what uh news their a you know where their where they find their sources of of information from 
um-hum 
yeah 
and then you know if if it 's uh if they 're satisfied 
and that 's about it really 
um-hum 
it 's hard to talk for five minutes on this 
yeah 
so um 
yeah 
well i guess i can just say i uh it bothers me that i hear a lot about um you know on the news that 
well it seems like i do n't know some things are sensationalized or some things are um 
you know you 'll hear one report 
and then you 'll hear that it you know they did n't um 
okay 
uh clothing at work 
um i work as a news reporter 
and a lot of 
oh 
i work in a since i work in a small station 
this is my first job and so i dress very variedly if that 's a word 
uh-huh 
um sometimes i 'm shooting and doing photography 
and so i 'll be in jeans one day 
and another day i 'll be on camera 
uh-huh 
and so i 'll be in a suit 
and another day i 'll come in 
and i wo n't know what i 'm doing 
so i 'll wear a pant suit in case i have to shoot 
yeah 
uh 
ah 
so it really varies 
i try to dress very comfortably 
i do n't really like dressing up at all 
oh me neither 
i do n't i do n't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that 
yeah 
i just 
i do n't know 
it just it takes too much time out of my day 
and i do n't i do n't know 
yeah 
same here 
i do n't mind not wearing any makeup 
yeah 
i do n't mind it at all i 
um i work at a bakery because i 'm a still a a college student um 
um-hum 
okay 
but we we have to wear white pants and um any color t shirt as long as it 's not like a bright color like a pastel 
white pants in a bakery 
yeah 
wow 
yeah 
the bakers wear all white 
okay 
and we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back 
and so 
what 's the name of the bakery 
oh italian i guess 
cullentini 's yeah 
it 's italian bakery 
and uh so i do n't mind having having to wear a uniform because i do n't have to buy you know yeah is n't that yeah many clothes 
new clothes and stu- 
yeah 
that 's one thing i would like is just to sort of have i 'd i really do n't like uniforms but just to have something where i do n't have to get up and decide what to wear 
oh yeah 
yeah 
because that just bugs me to death 
i know 
i do that every day for school 
oh oh yeah 
yeah 
but i- i like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things 
and sweats and 
things yeah 
when i was in school i was sweat monster 
yeah 
i mean that 's all i had was sweats 
and when it time to go out i did n't have anything to wear 
yeah 
i know 
i do n't have very many dress clothes 
but i do n't mind 
yeah 
i do n't need them yet 
yeah 
hum 
i hate shoes 
if i did n't have to have shoes i would n't have them 
oh really 
i just i do n't know my feet bother me 
and they 're just tedious to go find shoes for me it 's just 
oh 
i do n't know 
i wear a size nine and it i do n't know it 's just the shoes i get i r- either do n't like them or they do n't fit right 
oh 
and i just wish that i could just go without them 
hum 
oh wow i love shoes 
oh really 
i always buy shoes 
oh 
yeah 
just the opposite 
but um let 's see 
what else do i wear 
um if i were in a bigger market when i do get into a bigger market i 'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things and uh where i would n't have to shoot and do a lot of other things 
and i could then i would be able to dress more business like and things like that 
uh-huh 
but we 're all kind of just out of school at this station 
yeah 
and so we 're all you know still in sweats really 
oh 
so it 's pretty fun though 
i like the look the the like suit look professional like you know look 
but i i really do n't have much of a opportunity to wear it 
um-hum yeah 
um i 'm going to be a teacher 
i 
so i 'll probably just wear uh casual clothes maybe skirts and s- 
like 
yeah 
um-hum i like this the uh suits with the 
they come like with a mini type skirt you know and the jacket 
oh yeah 
i like that 
but but i 'm pretty short 
yeah 
that is cute 
i 'm five four 
and so that really does n't flatter me 
but i think it looks good on taller people 
yeah 
i 'm five three 
and 
are you 
yeah 
yeah 
anytime i go to the store 
i mean i i have like two pairs of pants because i can never find any that are short enough for me and it 's just oh ridiculous 
oh really 
pants too i could do without those 
oh 
pants and shoes 
i like the like stretch pants the cotton ones 
yeah 
those are nice 
they 're really comfortable 
those are nice 
with a baggy sweatshirt 
yeah 
yeah those are nice 
and tennis shoes 
my boyfriend 's got me these la gear 
they 're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes 
oh yeah 
and it it 's just like a chore to pick up my feet because i 'm used to wearing the little whi- ah white girl tennis shoes 
oh 
oh yeah i have a pair of those 
the little ones 
yeah 
yeah 
and i 'm used to those 
they 're just sort of you know 
like your feet and you do n't feel them 
yeah 
when you put these things on 
it 's it 's you know like exercise or something for your feet 
it 's like and i have to wear them because he gets upset if i do n't 
so so so how do people in wisconsin dress 
oh yeah 
warm this time this time of the year pretty warm 
warm 
sweaters and 
yeah yeah i grew up in new york 
and so i know what warm is 
-s like five pairs of socks and 
oh yeah 
yeah really

how long does it take you to make one 
duh uh if i would just work all day long making the clothes and everything probably about two and a half days 
oh really 
um-hum 
oh 
um so 
do you enjoy it 
yes i really do 
yeah 
uh-huh 
and then i also crochet 
and 
oh i- i- i can crochet and knit 
um actually i started an afghan 
but it 's been a a long time ago probably over a year ago 
yeah 
and it 's kept sitting in my closet half done right now 
but that it 's a knitting one 
and 
yeah 
i tried knitting first 
but i do n't know 
i- i did n't like it 
oh did n't you 
so then i went to crocheting 
but now i want to learn how to knit again 
oh 
i en- 
you know 
yeah 
i enjoy knitting 
i i kind of like that 
but i just i like i say i have n't done it for a while 
um-hum 
and i do like sewing sometimes 
i i 've made a few of the you know just the little valence curtains in my house and things like that 
um-hum 
but it it 's just finding the time for these things that you you enjoy 
yeah 
yeah 
but 
yeah 
i 'd in fact i just bought a serger in december 
oh i would love one of those 
yeah 
oh that 's neat 
i have n't done everything on it yet you know 
but just what little bit i have used it for i really like it 
oh those are wonderful are n't they 
you know especially making the seams and things like that you know it 's it 's got such a professional finish on them 
oh yeah 
that and that 's what i hate doing is the finishing stuff 
yeah 
it it 'd be nice to have that 
so i like that 
oh that 's neat 
and 
well do you have um uh 
i guess you 're kind of young 
i was going to say do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for 
well fifty seven 's not young 
but no 
my son 's n- ha- ha- has been married for almost ten years 
but they do n't have any children 
oh uh-huh 
so i just make clothes for my dolls 
oh well 
well how did you get involved in that 
just um you know just like sewing and stuff and decided t- to buy a pattern and try to make a doll 
you just so you did buy a pattern and then started from there 
and they it turned out really cute 
yeah 
you got to have a pattern for the body you know 
huh uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and uh 
ha- have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress 
yes 
yes 
yeah 
i 've i did make some clothes for one of those an- dress one of those 
are n't they cute 
yeah 
i have quite a few of them actually in my house 
i and most of them i have bought um already clothed 
but i did i did make the dress on one 
um-hum 
of them i kind of made the pattern up 
it 's not it 's probably not the best 
but 
um-hum no 
i i bought a bunny pattern one time 
but when i sewed it up the face of it looked like a mouse 
i oh it did 
um-hum 
oh 
s- it was too pointed 
oh 
so i tore it back apart again 
and i have n't tried another one 
you have n't sewn it back up huh 
no 
but i bought a little lamb pattern and the material and everything to make it out of 
but i have n't made it yet 
uh-huh 
uh do you do any kind of painting or anything 
no 
i do n't paint except i stenciled my wall 
uh-huh 
oh uh-huh 
i trie- i tried that 
i did i i ended up just stenciling a um a blind like a just a roller shade 
um-hum 
but i i can i had a hard time stenciling 
for some reason i just could n't do it 
oh really 
and people have told me it 's very easy 
oh yeah 
i my neighbor did it first 
and i seen her house 
and i saw how beautiful it looked 
so then i decided well i was going to do it 
and um it turned out really really good 
we- 
what design did you use 
uh mostly flowers you know 
oh uh-huh 
and what room 
i 've done it in all uh all my rooms 
have you 
i 've put it in the bedrooms in the bathroom 
um are you from this area 
i 'm from dallas 
oh okay 
i 'm in garland 
so 
yeah okay 
well i 'm in dallas right now 
but i 'm living in garland 
um-hum 
um well i do n't know if you know 
but garland has got a real big recycling center that in fact we went to yesterday 
you drive up 
and you take the stuff out of your trunk 
and they have different bins for the different materials like clear glass and colored glass and plastics 
and uh they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom 
that 's pretty neat 
my my daughter is four 
and she 's real interested in recycling 
um-hum 
so we 're we 're trying to promote that because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away 
but we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them 
uh does dallas have a curbside recycling program yet 
um well i do n't know if dallas 
is 
richardson does 
oh okay 
um they started with newspapers and uh of course aluminum cans and and bottles and plastic 
yeah 
i did n't know there were different types of plastic though 
hum yeah 
um like soda bottles are one kin- one type of plastic 
and milk jugs are one type of plastic 
you can te- 
it 's go- it 'll 
most of the recyclable containers have a little symbol on the bottom with little with the arrows around it that tells whether it 's a one or a two or a three 
um-hum 
oh 
it 's it 's just different kind of plastics 
like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic 
oh ok- 
know that 's what the different types are 
yeah 
yeah 
it seems to be made out of something different 
yeah 
yes i i know there 's a long scientific name 
uh um-hum yeah 
but it 's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff 
hum 
um i like i do n't know if if they do it all over 
but our kroger does a a newspaper recycling every saturday 
you can drive up 
and they have one of the clerks out there no the bag boys out there um that will take the papers newspaper out of your car 
and they 'll put it in their little bin 
and they do the recycling 
i mean they collect the newspapers and their pla- the plastic grocery bags which i think is pretty neat 
that 's something since we all ha- seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags 
that 's right 
yeah 
i know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things 
um-hum 
lunch bags 
yeah yeah 
in fact i have one today 
and ri- 
it 's um-hum the only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom 
yeah 
they did n't 
and it 's like whoops there goes my chips okay 
yeah 
fine 
um-hum 
now i 
in fact did you happen to see twenty twenty the other night 
uh no 
they did a program 
or the one of their articles was on recycling 
and or it was actually on a a town that has a dump that they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there 
they have made so much money from that that they built they bought a brand new fire engine 
and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house was n't big enough 
so they bought bought a new or built a new one paid for it in cash with the money that they 've earned from this landfill 
um-hum 
they have built up one mountain 
they call it mount trashmore 
oh yeah 
they built up one mountain covered it with grass and put ski lifts on it 
and in the winter they put snow on it 
and they charge to ski on it 
so the city gets the money from that 
they built a golf course at the bottom 
and they get the money from that 
wow 
it 's like 
that 's 
it 's a it 's riverview ohio or some place up there 
um-hum 
but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea 
they i mean their city hall looked better 
it was nicer than dallas 
and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city 
hum 
and they like the trash 
so 
i like well okay 
but i thought that was pretty neat 
it it would be nice if more communities could do that 
but you have to know from beginning 
and you have to have the space to do it 
and 
yeah 
they 'll run out of space before long 
yeah 
see that 's 
well they 're already planning a second mountain 
um-hum 
so they 're going to get going to be called the twin peaks 
i was like uh-huh go back to the tv shows 
this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling 
oh it 's 
we i know 
like i said i 've got a two year old and a four year old 
and that 's 
my daughter thinks that anytime she sees newspapers bundled up they 're being recycled 
um-hum 
so it 's like well no honey 
so that like 
so that was one reason we went to show her what people did with their their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well yeah you melt down the cans 
right 
and you make them into new things 
and you get the paper all wet 
and you make it into new paper 
and that 's fun trying to explain that to a four year old 
right 
yeah 
oh so do y 'all go ahead 
they do n't even know that paper comes from trees yet 
so 
and well yeah 
sh- 
that was the her next question was how do you grow paper 
how do you grow paper 
was like well from trees um that 's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees 
um-hum 
and how do you grow aluminum 
yeah 
exactly 
um 
um well let 's see um 
we really do n't 
but 
and then she was like well what do you do with the glass 
well you crunch it up real small 
and then you melt it down 
well what if it breaks 
well okay 
it it it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her 
right 
but at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing 
and she got our baby sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that 's all she talked about 
um-hum 
so i guess wha- 
okay 
you ready to discuss the the topic 
what 's the topic 
okay 
the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in america and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago 
okay 
are you ready for that 
you bet 
okay 
i 'll let you lead out 
pardon me 
i 'll let you lead out 
okay 
well uh there 's uh 
it 's kind of an in- interesting topic and one that i think is quite fascinating because uh couple of years ago i guess uh not very not m- not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the united states but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in a you know a very comfortable position so to say even though the the cold war was was in full swing 
you know you had the the russians against the americans the communists against the free world 
and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where uh couple of years ago we had uh america uh was a one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned 
and now we 're having a very tough time in a recessionary period 
we 're also have a very humongous trade deficit 
and uh and that 's kind of frightening 
also you know a couple of years ago ten fif- fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life 
and thirty years ago that was that was basically it whereas now we 're expected to have a career change every you know every couple years and possibly fi- four to five career changes throughout our lifetime 
and so i think uh you know things 
there 's been an awful lot of social change lately 
and a 
lo- and uh 
i think one of the things that 's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the they seem to be social they seem to be economically driven also 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so if you look at russia and what 's happened over there i think the change in communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing 
i think was i look at the economic problems in the united states right now 
one of the things you wonder is what 's that going to do to us 
true 
i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things 
i mean i think it 's great that you can have three or four different careers in your life 
um-hum 
i think it must 've been terribly boring to go through your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years 
yes 
yes 
so i think that opportunity for job change in the fact that that aspects changing 
true 
true 
and the uncertainty of whether you 're going to have a job is not as good 
but the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs 
um-hum 
well do you do you think that 's good or bad 
i think it 's great 
you think that 's great 
oh yeah 
that someth- 
yeah 
because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position 
they they 're very comfortable 
they lose the ability to learn 
and the in a sense become unteachable 
they think they know all there is to know in their area set path and you know come in and put my time in from nine to five 
and when that 's over with that 's that 's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular um education 
and and i think that 's an excellent opportunity for us to to expand ourselves also 
i think one of the problems with with education in as it relates to this though is that i do n't know that e- education is prepared to help people make those changes 
it still seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think 's going to be a hard thing for for people to face 
um-hum 
yes 
i agree with that 
i agree with that 
so i i believe that uh an individual should really learn how to to learn learn how to adapt learn how to grow in the in their college or whatever education they might take 
yeah 
so that that 's good 
that 's good 
there probably needs to be some training on how to to to to adjust to these changes as they come about 
i mean if you look at the the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations i do n't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them even ideas of how to make those changes now 
um-hum 
so it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we 're not well preparing people to make the changes with them 
yeah 
i i- i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress uh for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now 
um-hum 
that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place 
and it affect- 
well nancy what do you think um some of the changes in roles of women are in american society in the past generation or two 
well of course working 
um-hum 
that 's definitely got to be the biggest thing is that everybody 's out there working including me 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
well what do you think it is 
um yeah 
i agree 
yeah 
i also think that there are more um 
the people are 
women stay single longer it seems like 
yes 
they do 
yeah 
yeah 
they do 
i know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty and i waited until i was thirty two 
right 
so 
uh-huh 
yeah 
you know um i know that 
yeah 
that 's true 
it 's a big change 
i 'm an ob nurse 
and so i really do see what you 're saying there 
uh-huh 
it used to be that our list ran nineteen twenty twenty one for our patients ages 
and now our care plans look more like thirty two thirty three if we get somebody twenty one we go oh look how young 
uh-huh 
yeah 
so yeah 
you 're right there 's a big change 
and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties 
uh-huh 
so that 's true 
yeah 
but again i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers 
um-hum 
if they did n't have if they were n't out there working and having their careers they probably would be married and having their children 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
seems like there 
i guess it 's a combination 
uh-huh 
go ahead 
no 
go on 
oh it just seems like there are more single mothers too 
i mean that 's there 're a lot of either divorced or um you know never been married 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
there 's a lot of mixed up families 
that 's for sure 
yeah 
i agree 
well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so 
yeah well just that 
i think the families 
the the role in the family 
and the mother does n't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children um 
um-hum 
we do it all 
yeah 
i really think that 
and i know that there 's a lot more participation by the fathers 
but i still think the mothers have the major role 
um-hum 
i really do 
i think they 're just they 're not doing very much less i do n't think as far as the kids and and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see and and they 're contributing to the income besides 
yeah 
yeah 
uh-huh 
i think that we 're really really putting a lot of stress on ourselves 
um-hum 
yeah 
and it really it 's affecting the families you know for mothers not not to be home 
oh it is 
and yet you know um 
i mean i i do n't blame anybody when they have to work because um 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's it 's difficult 
and i think that 
i live in plano actually 
so it 's very wealthy town 
um-hum 
and we 're not part of that 
but i it is you know 
and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better and i really hate that you know 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i hate to see that 
an- and i 've been here for a very long time but um i do n't know 
um-hum 
now i 'm a single parent 
and i do n't have a choice anymore but i used to just work occasionally for extra money 
um-hum 
but now i have to work all the time and that 's really hard and and i do n't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and and leave the kids 
um-hum 
yeah 
in a way it 's good it 's very good to get out with adults 
and i think that 's a good thing if you can do it part time 
um-hum 
but to just go out there forty hours a week at least and and work and and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing i think that 's not very smart 
yeah 
i think that 's difficult on them 
um-hum 
so 
yeah 
well what do you think 's going to happen in the next generation 
you think it 'll continue 
well it 's going to be interesting 
yeah 
i yeah 
i think it will change 
but i 'm not sure how it 's going to because i see young people today and wonder how in the world they 'll ever afford to buy a home and and to raise a family 
um-hum 
i do n't know how they 're going to do it 
um-hum 
and so i do n't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again 
i do n't think that ever will go backwards but i do n't know what effect it 's going to have on these kids now when they grow up how they 're going to feel about it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
it you know it could lead to another woodstock type thing you know where where there 's just too much material things 
yeah 
and and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things and they might want to do without things rather than do that to their families 
um-hum 
yeah 
um-hum 
it 's hard to say 
yeah 
it is 
i think some 
i do n't know how many you know what percentage but some are will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children 
i guess i see that happening already some choosing it 
uh-huh 
and and they get you know 
there 're 
people chide them for it you know 
why are n't you out 
all right 
um serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it 
um 
well what do you think 
well i that 's funny because i just um quit my job to stay home with my kids 
oh 
and um i was a teacher for seven years in the public schools 
so i know a little bit about it not a whole great deal 
well tell me about it 
what are what are the problems with public education 
well um there there 's some 
there 's several 
it 's such a a broad you know topic that y- y- you need to boil it down 
uh-huh 
but um one that um i thought was a problem that it 's a it i thought it was a serious problem that i 'm not sure it 's being taken care of right now uh was like bilingual education for um different um minority groups and like asians and um uh mexican americans and and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they and in this area 
uh-huh 
and um as the school district i 'm not sure how to go about it because it 's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these language and so most of these children are put in um either special ed or a bilingual program and then for just a small amount of time 
right 
and then they 're into their regular classrooms the remaining of the part of the day 
and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they do n't read or speak english 
um-hum 
and so um a lot of the moneys is n't put into that 
and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner 
and um you know i- there 's only so long you can do that 
and to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts 
right 
and a lot of the teachers 
it n- it was not the teacher 's fault 
a lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children 
do you find that those parents um 
i 've seen the same thing and heard the same things 
and at the same time i 've heard that it 's even harder when both parents are required to work and can n't spend you know that that time you know typically the mother was at home with uh the children and and at least could kind of keep up on what 's going on 
yeah 
yeah 
and really society sort of dictates that uh you know both the parents work 
yeah 
a- and um i know i 've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the you know the second and third grade uh if the kids had you know proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that that would make a lot of difference 
yeah oh yeah 
oh definitely 
definitely 
and it and it teaches language too which is really good 
yeah 
um 
well i work at a university 
and and it 's really tough when we 're uh uh 
i i uh work at the university of texas at dallas 
and uh we have uh some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and you know there are some students who are in the top ten percent of their class even some who are maybe you know in the top ten uh of their class 
and their s a t scores are very low 
and a lot of it h- has to do with their uh their reading ability you know their their language 
yeah 
an- it uh makes it tough because whe- when you know when they come in with scores that low they may be uh good students 
oh definitely 
yeah 
but they just have n't achieved to their fullest potential 
and they 're going to fail unless some sort of remedial uh education is given to them 
so and then it then it comes into well who 's supposed to give it to them 
right 
right 
the colleges and universities 
or are they supposed to get that back in the high schools and the junior highs 
well i know richardson school district has a has a wonderful program in the remedial reading um where you know of course all the children are tested in some time at portion of the year 
and and uh some children who need extra help are put into this um reading program 
and it is just excellent 
it is 
yep 
i wish that all the children could be exposed to that program you know 
and then there i know that there are some parents that say how do i get my kids in that 
and yet they do n't qualify 
but unfortunate that they do n't qualify because i think everybody would benefit from these programs 
yeah 
it sounds like it 
it is excellent 
so 
so how many children do you have at home 
i have two little ones 
and that 's why i i quit my job 
oh 
uh you know i 've been teaching since they were gosh newborns 
and and it just was n't adding up 
and you know being a teacher and you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just you know do n't have the time time time time 
yeah 
it was kind of getting to me where well i 'm doing the same thing 
and so um you know my children are getting older 
and i was missing out on a lot 
so i just decided to stay home for a while 
i do n't know how long as lo- 
-ell that 's good what wh- 
okay um 
what kind of hobbies do you have lori 
um i guess uh i like to play golf 
uh-huh 
and um i also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts 
uh-huh 
where do you play golf or in this area 
well we live uh pretty close to the mesquite golf course 
uh-huh 
so we 'll play either out there or at firewheel 
that 's usually where we play 
but i 've played you know different courses in in the dallas area 
do you uh do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf 
uh both 
not at the same time 
i was going to say that could be difficult 
now sometimes we ride 
and sometimes um we pu- 
we like to to a lot of times just walk for the exercise 
but i find that when i ride in a cart i play better 
uh-huh 
and i think it 's because i do n't get as tired 
i think that might be true 
yeah 
i do n't like pulling a cart on firewh- golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path 
i know 
and that makes me so mad 
i you know it 's like it 's not going to do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently 
that 's the reason i do n't play over there 
yeah 
i like the course but i do n't play over there because you they do n't uh you know do n't allow you to pull a cart 
right 
and i do n't think a cart damages the turf 
right 
well the reason why we play over there is because since we 're a garland resident they give us a special deal where you can get um ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollar 
yeah 
a hundred dollars 
because it 's half price what the normal green fees are 
uh-huh 
so that 's why we you know play over there 
because we 've got our card 
well i guess i could use a car too 
i live uh very near very close to the firewheel golf course 
oh do you 
so you live in garland then 
yes 
i live in northwest garland 
right up there near the golf course 
okay 
well we 're in south garland 
but yeah next time you go um you know check into it 
they 've uh 
it 's just like uh a bus card 
and they just punch it you know 
it 's got one through ten on it 
and every time you go they just punch it for you 
in fact well in the last two years i have n't played very much golf because i 'm involved in boy scouts 
oh okay 
so i have uh i have children i have children boy scout age 
you must have a a son 
i have two boys that are boy scout age 
and so i 'm very active in boy scouts 
oh okay 
so i 'd have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and boy scouts is my hobby 
yeah 
but i -ke but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again 
oh well that sounds like fun too 
because my boys are still right at the beginning age 
and it 's going to probably be six to eight years before they go to college 
uh-huh 
well you need to teach them how to play take them out on the course with you 
so that 's right 
lessons are expensive though 
oh yeah 
well you can teach them 
well they probably would never make it then 
because i do n't i think 
i only took lessons for golf when i was in college 
uh-huh 
ah as a course for p e you know so i could graduate 
right 
right 
uh-huh 
but uh that 's the only time i think i 've ever really taken golf lessons 
and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual 
uh-huh 
right 
right 
i took one lesson one other time 
besides that um i just uh try to make the club hit the ball 
right 
yeah 
i know what you mean 
i do n't want to play strike out you know 
uh-huh 
but i have fun doing it 
some you know have some good shots and some bad shots 
oh yeah 
it 's it 's just nice to get outdoors and do something 
so you said you work uh in the gardens too 
do you have ah special flowers 
well flower gardens 
i like to have 
matter fact this past weekend i- i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs 
so those ought to be coming up around spring time 
my wife had uh just put in a bunch of i want to say they 're pansies 
uh-huh 
she put them in like two months ago because they 're winter plants 
right 
and they just bl- 
with a- even with all the cold weather weather we 've had they 've been blooming just fine 
oh they do great 
i put mine in probably in november 
that 's when she did i think 
yeah 
i think was november 
and i do n't do anything to mi- i do n't water mine or anything 
and they just 
they do really good 
and i even had i guess it was last year the year before i had some out 
and it froze 
and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later 
i did n't do anything to them 
so they 're um they 're they 're good to plant in the winter time 
because they last for a long time then 
so if you start putting them you know you can put them out in the spring too 
but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them because they can n't stand the hot weather 
um-hum 
do they survive longer if you put them in the winter time 
will they make it through the summer some 
no 
they wo n't make it through the summer because it gets too hot 
but they 'd make it through probably winter and spring 
so 
um-hum 
yeah 
i 've got some of those too 
i love flowers 
well oh that 's good 
yeah 
and i do some i try to do some arts and crafts 
and i love to go the to 
well what kind of music do you like 
well seeing as how i 'm a musician i like all kinds of music 
um-hum yeah 
all very very kinds 
we um-hum me too 
i mostly like classical and jazz 
uh-huh 
well i like everything from hard core country to you know wagner and mahler 
and i like new age stuff 
i- i basically have a wide range of musical likes 
do you um are you musical uh 
are you a musician at all 
um-hum yeah 
i play the trumpet 
do you 
uh-huh 
most of the trumpet music 's um um baroque and um um um romantic 
jazz 
baroque and romantic 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that 's not there there 's um things written for doc severinsen and a few other people 
but uh they 're just uh 
as far as solos and concertos are concerned 
but the rest of them are just parts 
right 
and all 
well i love baroque music 
so it 's one of my favorite periods 
um 
in fact i i sing with the texas baroque ensemble 
um-hum 
and and um-hum who are the trumpet players 
well we used to have um ralph dutchen 
in that uh-huh 
but now he 's in massachusetts 
he 's come back a couple of times 
then there 's a trumpet player at north texas the the teacher the main teacher yeah 
leonard 
and he 's played 
and the two of them have played natural trumpets 
and occasionally when she can n't get those people we 'll use you know just uh e flat trumpets with valves 
and like glen bell plays 
candelaria yeah 
and uh rick um bogart 's played too 
uh-huh 
so but actually i like i like trumpet and organ together 
it 's a nice combination 
um-hum yeah uh-huh um-hum yeah 
richard jung julio recorded an album at saint thomas aquinas 
did n't he 
yeah 
i think he did 
yeah 
with paul 
yeah 
he 's wonderful 
both of them are 
so do you like romantic music 
well that 's what that 's mostly the rest of good trumpet marks are romantic music mahler and ruckner and and strauss 
um-hum 
do you like opera 
uh i like i 'm liking it more and more now 
uh-huh 
getting used to it 
and mostly uh mostly mozart 
there 's a uh-huh 
i mean there 's n- there 's not any kind of trumpet parts 
but uh you know the i just like the melodies more and and and uh the libretto 
uh-huh 
you do n't like puccini 
um yeah 
well i like rossini better than puccini 
uh-huh 
i like more comic than 
uh-huh 
are you going to go see the elixir of love 
no 
do you ever go to the dallas opera 
uh no 
i 've never been to the dallas opera 
only the fort worth opera 
uh-huh 
and my trumpet teacher used to uh play in the fort worth opera 
who was your trumpet teacher 
uh john nelson 
uh-huh 
i know him 
i kind of know him 
uh-huh 
is he still around here 
yeah 
he played in the fort worth symphony in fort worth mostly 
because i do n't i 've not seen him playing anywhere lately 
but maybe it 's because he 's playing in fort worth 
yeah 
yeah 
well i 'm basically a church musician 
i do a church in plano 
uh 
and we do all kinds of music at my church 
and we hire lots of instrumentalists off and on for different things 
so i 'm always making music of one kind or another 
um-hum 
which church is it 
uh it 's at christ united methodist church in plano 
uh uh-huh it seems like a lot of churches are hiring more musicians now than they used to 
yeah 
most churches have the 
well there 's some of the few organizations that have the funds to you know to do like big big works uh 
but we hire you know we hire an orchestra at least twice a year and then different instrumentalists off and on throughout the year 
that we have 
you know john cuminado 
um-hum yes 
he plays at our church a lot 
in fact he is playing this sunday at our church 
but he plays pretty regularly 
uh-huh but he 's still teaching at brookhaven 
is n't he 
uh i think so 
he teaches a lot in plano at high schools but i think he teaches at brookhaven 
oh yeah 
yeah 
because i heard glen bell taught at plano as well 
yeah 
glen teaches here too 
uh-huh 
they 're the two of them are mainly pretty much the i think they 've cornered the market on trumpet students 
yeah 
okay 
so you enjoy camping 
oh yeah 
yeah 
i uh like like you i have n't done it in quite some time except for what i call living now which is which is very close to camping 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
is it 
uh-huh 
yeah 
you know i i camped in the boy scouts 
and uh you know my dad and i went out sometimes 
but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working i camped almost all the time because i was in construction 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
and it 's cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress 
yeah 
i mean you when you have to have it you got to have it 
um-hum 
and you know in uh in those those kinds of situations uh you know room rent was just outrageous 
um-hum 
yeah 
so my buddy and i we just camped 
uh-huh 
and we figured what the hell 
we did it when we were kids 
and we loved it 
uh-huh 
course we did n't really rough it that much 
when when i was in in high school 
uh he 's a couple of years older than me 
and uh he graduated and went off to college 
and and du- during summer we 'd camp out at the lake 
um-hum 
but it was was n't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove and 
oh well yeah 
you know i had a little uh boat house and floated it out on lake grapevine 
um-hum 
and uh well it was fantastic 
we 'd get up in the morning go skiing at 
that substituted for a shower you know and then we 'd go to work and uh come back to the you know to the boat house at night 
um-hum 
um-hum 
you know in in the afternoon you know it 's still four oclock 
you got four hours of day light good skiing left 
and uh it was great 
yeah 
but uh you know now my life is more like camping than not camping really 
um-hum 
do you have electricity out there 
oh yeah 
yeah 
you 've got a phone obviously 
well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago 
um-hum 
we did n't have a phone 
uh-huh 
and they did n't have phone lines 
i mean there was you just could n't get a phone 
yeah 
and uh we 're on the we 're third from the end on the electric string 
uh-huh 
so uh and we 're at the end of the mail route 
yeah 
like i said we are probably as far as you can get from a seven eleven and still be in texas 
yeah 
i guess so huh 
but uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and i is we got a a mobile home one of these twelve by forty eight 's that got repaid and uh i swapped them a cadillac for it and uh put it out here on the land figuring i 'd build a house some day you know 
um-hum 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
i 'm in construction 
and uh you know i just had this place you know to shower up while i was you know out here you know putting up fence and building driveway and drilling well and all that stuff that you have to do before you can even put a house in you know 
um-hum 
and uh i came home from work one friday afternoon 
and our truck was packed 
everything we had was in boxes 
and my wife said uh we 're moving 
um 
and i said where 
she said out to the trailer 
and i said oh 
no she said yep 
i said okay 
um-hum 
so we 've been uh roughing it out here about three years 
but it 's not bad 
i we got color tv and microwave i mean you know it 's not horrible 
but it 's it 's a lot like camping 
uh-huh 
yeah 
well i grew up in california in southern uh central california right in the valley 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
so it 's forty five minute drive to the mountains 
and um so my dad loved fishing and camping 
so we 'd go up 
first we went up just uh with a toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our um hot dogs by the fire or whatever 
sure 
but then later my mom and dad got a camper 
so uh we 've kind of moved up 
became civilized 
yeah 
a little bit in the world 
yep 
my mom goes camping you know 
she she takes her uh motor home 
you know she 's got one of these huge winnebago 's with a refrigerator and air conditioning color tv microwave oven you know 
yeah 
she just 
roughing it for me is you know going to the holiday inn and getting a shower you know 
yeah 
and but you know she has a lot of fun 
um-hum 
and mostly it 's just a way to 
she she goes to dog shows 
um-hum 
see she shows dogs 
and uh you can sneak a dog into a motel but you can n't sneak ten dogs into a motel 
um-hum 
no 
and so she you know takes the motor home 
and she made a deal with my dad that she 'd take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing 
um-hum 
and she 
but if he 'd buy her a motor home 
so he did 
yeah 
but as far as as camping my wife and i had plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the you know highway one there in in california uh as soon as we get this house finished 
um-hum 
yeah 
oh that 's a that 'll be pretty 
i 'm going to need a vacation 
that 's really pretty out there 
so a lot of nice places 
are you bob 
i am in plano 
where are you 
oh okay 
i am in waco 
is that right 
yeah 
oh okay 
right down the street 
oh credit cards 
my favorite subject 
you mean you use credit cards 
oh do i 
i bet you used them all up over christmas 
uh yeah 
mostly over christmas 
uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off and so then you have no money 
and then your are in debt 
so you use a credit card 
i understand that 
so yeah 
uh i probably have one of every credit card there is 
do you use them a lot 
well uh it kind of comes and goes uh 
i use uh citibank uh the advantage one pretty much because you get advantage points for every dollar you spend 
uh-huh 
and once a year i get a free airplane ride that way 
oh 
so as long as you pay it off every month it does n't cost you anything 
yeah 
yeah 
well that is a good idea 
that through a visa 
so that is what i 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
huh 
but uh i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use 
but uh if i can get away with paying them off every month it is alright 
uh-huh 
if i do n't then it gets expensive 
yeah 
yeah that is my problem 
i do n't try and pay them off 
i pay like the minimum 
well you should n't do that 
but i know 
so i have got myself 
you y- y- nev- y- y- you never get out of the hole that way 
exactly 
i have got that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now 
but i pay most of them on time and everything 
it is just the 
i always have them 
so it is kind of strange 
kind of like the federal government right 
oh yeah 
exactly like the government 
in in debt 
ne- never get out of debt 
and any time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right 
for yeah yeah 
have they put the cap on the interest rates 
so no no 
i did n't know if they actually did that or not 
i know they were i know they were considering it 
just the people who do n't need credit get the four and a half percent 
the rest of the uh and me we got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent 
uh-huh 
yeah 
funny how that works is n't it 
so th- thou who does n't need credit gets cheap credit 
i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety two as opposed to nineteen ninety one even nineteen ninety 
i think i think it be amazing how much how many more people use it 
well i think so 
because the 
because of the economy 
that 's right 
yeah 
right you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at 
exactly 
i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that 
i think that would be interesting 
yeah do you do you have any uh credit union or anything where you work or anything like that 
yeah 
i have a credit union 
do you we have a master card or visa too 
yeah 
they do 
uh-huh 
you got that one 
yes 
i do 
yes 
i do a matter of fact 
who who do you work for 
uh i work for channel six 
oh 
it 's it 's an nbc affiliate down here 
yeah i do a lot of work down in waco 
a lot of i call on a lot of my business is down there 
oh really 
oh okay 
where do you work 
what is your 
yeah i sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling 
oh okay 
and uh tyme and mercury and tempco and all those people down there 
oh okay 
gnk 
so you probably work with uh uh 
what is the boy from here 
you ever work with davis 
davis iron 
davis iron work 
yeah 
yes 
yep matter of fact i just saw them last week 
oh okay 
and uh what else 
yep a- are you in that part are you in the south part of town now 
yeah well i live actually in hewett 
oh yeah 
okay 
yeah 
right outside 
you know you know uh parker machine tool down there 
so that is where davis iron works is 
uh 
bobby parker 
i do n't think i have seen that one 
i am sure i pass by it or something 
but i am not sure 
there is a place in hewett called 
it is a new company called prime air 
that is in hewett just around the corner from davis iron works 
huh prime air 
yeah they make uh humidifiers and uh filters for air filtration stuff for you know hospitals homes something like that 
oh okay 
okay 
have you ever been to marlin 
it 's a new kin- uh yeah 
i think it is marlin or mart 
they have uh uh a place i guess that would be similar to prime air 
it is called h g h or something like k g h or 
oh really 
huh 
i can n't think of 
i can n't think of the name 
but 
i will have to stop in there 
i went i have gone through there uh 
my oldest son goes to a&m and 
uh-huh oh yeah 
he is working on his mas- 
the navy sent him there for his master 's mostly in engineering 
so once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty five 
uh-huh uh-huh yeah 
that is about the last time i have been through marlin and mart 
uh-huh 
oh i do n't like that drive 
i make that drive sometimes 
we have stories out there 
but 
there is always a state trooper down there 
huh 
you have got to drive careful 
oh really 
i know 
between mart and marlin they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour 
oh goodness 
they they are bad at hewett too on eighty four 
huh uh-huh 
they are real bad 
that is where i got my last ticket 
so of course i could n't pay that on a cre- 
okay 
i pressed the button 
okay 
let me tell you 
i have n't been too many places 
so you have n't been to too many places 
no 
no 
i have n't 
okay 
well i 've been to hawaii 
see now that 's where i want to go 
that 's where i 've always wanted to go 
i 've never been there 
oh it 's it 's beautiful 
i know 
ah is it is it um 
i had an aunt that lived there 
and she she could n't stand it anymore 
she moved out because she said the whole island was ta- you know being taken over by the japanese 
well there is there is a lot of japanese over there 
and they 're 
yeah 
and sh- and um she also told me that 
well not her uh necessarily other people that have been there said it 's it 's too commercialized 
um-hum 
is it 
ooh well yeah 
there 's it 's commercialized 
but there 's still a lot of beautiful places to go and see you know uh on all of the islands 
yeah 
sure 
you know now the island of of 
oahu naturally has got more people on it than the other islands 
uh-huh 
but but it 's still beautiful 
you 've got to see it at least once 
oh well i will eventually 
you know so 
wha- well what i- what 's the most uh you know the nicest island 
uh i like maui 
maui 
i think that 's usually what people uh say they did n't they like the best 
yeah 
i mean i like it because the beach is nice and white 
and you know it 's like um oahu 
you can go over there lay on the beach 
and it 's really nice 
uh-huh 
where the island of hawaii you really can n't lay on the beach over there 
yeah 
you know but um in kauai 
it 's and i mean their beaches are nice 
but i do n't know just not nice as maui 
yeah 
and then uh have you where have where have you been 
well i have been to california 
i 've been to san francisco 
oh you have 
i loved it 
i absolutely loved it 
oh 
yeah 
and um 
how long ago 
oh uh eighty six 
hm 
okay 
my sister lives out there 
my sister lives in piedmont 
oh yeah 
i know where that 's at 
yeah 
because i used to live in oakland 
uh-huh 
so 
oh well that 's right near piedmont 
yeah 
right 
right 
right yeah 
well yeah that 's like a suburb or something what 
yes 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
is that oh yeah 
okay 
well she lived in berkeley also 
and she let 's see i went when she was uh living 
um-hum 
wh- we- like when i went out there she was in um now i ca- oh lafayette 
she was living in lafayette 
oh yeah 
right 
and then they moved to piedmont 
um-hum 
so i uh i have n't seen uh you know her house in piedmont 
but but i love san francisco 
i 'd like to go back 
yeah 
did you go in the cable cars and everything 
oh yeah 
yeah 
is n't that fun 
went to alcatraz 
you know we did the whole bit 
and then we went to the wine country 
oh yeah 
up by napa 
yeah 
yeah 
oh beautiful 
yeah 
and uh we went to carmel 
um-hum 
you know and we took the eighteen mile drive 
is n't that pretty 
i love it down there 
oh it 's beautiful 
it 's really beautiful 
um-hum 
my girlfriend was down there a few months ago 
first time she 's been down there 
and they wanted to take that drive 
and they had closed the whole road because o- of fog 
oh what the weather 
yeah 
so th- sh- they never got to do that 
um 
well i have also been to the carribean 
oh i have n't been there either 
you name it i have n't been there 
well i 've i been there a couple of times 
i uh-huh 
i went on a cruise 
oh that 's nice 
the last time i went i went with my two sisters 
uh-huh 
and it was over christmas time 
yeah 
and we really had a good time 
uh-huh 
well they um had this cruise director dress up like santa claus 
and we went to the beach 
and they had put a christmas tree on the beach decorated it up 
um-hum uh-huh 
and it was it was a lot of fun 
well that 's nice 
so 
is is that cruise nicer than it if you just go on a regular you know to a hotel 
oh yeah 
or you know it is 
now i 've heard it is 
yeah 
yeah 
because you do n't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that you know 
you put your clothes in your room 
um-hum 
and oh you 'll have to go on one 
you do n't get seasick 
that 's what i 'm afraid of 
no 
no 
huh 
no i mean there was 
some people did um on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in but that 's unusual 
uh-huh 
yeah 
um one of my sisters got sick 
but the other one did n't 
and i did n't 
uh-huh 
you know but um it 's really nice 
and they just they just do so many things for you you know to make you enjoy the trip and everything 
right 
yeah 
so you 'll have to do that once 
i want to go on another one 
but i want to go to alaska 
oh yes 
now someone i know w- was on a cruise to alaska 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and uh was it alaska 
yeah 
i 'm pretty sure 
that 's right my hairdresser 
oh really 
she went last year 
she said she went on a cruise 
and i 'm thinking you know cruise i 'm thinking 
sun 
and she 's laying on the beach 
i said well you 're not very tan for someone who 's been on a crui- 
she says we went to alaska 
yeah 
right 
you know and uh that that 's uh i 'd like to go 
well hawaii wou- is my uh is my is number one 
i 'd also like to go to australia have you 
oh i i think i would like to too 
yeah 
i keep hoping to win the lotto for i can do all these things you know 
oh well see i i 'm just into the publisher 's clearing house and the reader 's digest because we do n't uh 
right now the lottery here 
okay 
have you painted something lately 
yes 
i have 
that room i showed you 
yeah 
and then since then we painted the bedroom 
oh yeah 
another bedroom 
yeah 
i showed you that one too did n't i 
the brown one 
hm yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
the one that looks like a fudgesicle 
oh yeah 
yeah 
oh heavens 
well i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom 
yeah 
but i get i have that trouble with the the ceiling you know the uh what is that blow the blow ceiling you know where you get around the edge 
oh yeah 
well i 've heard 
now i asked janice somebody recently about ho- how you do that oh uh when you paint the ceiling if you know when you got that textured stuff that they 'd have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you 'd paint that with 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
well how do you get the edge though 
how you get the edge 
the the straight edge 
you just have to be real careful 
oh i see 
we use a a two inch brush with uh on a slant and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but 
huh 
well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too 
well yeah 
i think i 'm going to do it this spring actually 
oh really 
there 're 
there 're six houses 
see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that we do as far as the the materials 
oh oh nice 
there 's three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses 
yeah 
so i 'm thinking i 'm going to change it to something you know 
the brick is multicolor with mostly earth tones 
uh-huh 
i think i 'm going to put something like a brown on it on the outside yeah and maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something someth- where it 'll stand out a little 
oh that 'd be nice 
hm 
what color 'd you paint 
or two tone or two tone you know 
wh- yeah 
there 's some columns that could be painted a different color too 
uh-huh 
what color did you paint your house 
well the white 
on the outs- 
but i have a problem 
i can n't get up high 
and we can n't paint the chimney 
well you got to get one of those ladders 
well we have one of those ladders 
we 're just not willing to get up that high 
oh yeah 
well a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he 's done his house 
and that 's what he 
i was out there last weekend 
he 's finished everything except the chimney 
well we did too 
we did it in the fall 
and it 's just it 's too high 
it 's really scary 
but and the only thing i would consider doing a professional is maybe doing that 
yeah 
but is 
other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional 
yeah yeah i know our house in new mexico it was stucco 
but we had all this trim to paint and a lots of it 
yeah 
and we did basically seventy five percent of the house 
and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff 
uh-huh 
so i hired this man to come in and do it 
young kid 
uh-huh 
and he came with with his own r- 
uh what do you call those things 
the blowers 
no 
those where you built like a rafter thing 
oh oh oh oh i know what you 're talking about 
um scaffolds 
yeah 
scaffolds 
that 's it 
yeah he came and did it that way 
and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up 
huh 
and literally i would n't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactuses and if he fell he was dead 
it 's 
yeah 
and he knew that 
so 
oh my 
so that was worth it getting a professional for that 
yeah 
plus he cleaned up my mess 
oh i think that 's what we might have to do with the chimney 
but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself 
yeah 
it was n't too bad 
i mean you save 
how much did it cost you to for the paint for the outside 
shoot maybe a hundred and fifty 
yeah 
you know since it 's a one story 
but we did uh like two heavy coats over it 
but in in in that way you know you 're assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it 
yeah 
that yeah that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to oh furrows i guess to buy his paint and yet he bought like seventeen gallons 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
my word 
and anyway he when he checked out they o- and and he was using his furrows charge card too they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something 
um-hum 
um-hum 
oh my word 
and he had he had the b- he had already carried a ladder outside and and told her that 
uh-huh 
and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint so she had to start all over again and he when he got outside he noticed his receipt was for like thirteen ninety nine or something 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
oh my word 
and he saw 
so that was really worth it painting his own house 
i- i guess yeah 
it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff 
oh my word 
oh my word 
well he really saved in that way 
yeah 
but yeah 
i think we 're going to to do uh another bathroom 
but uh i think i 'll probably just do it in a roller 
i want to do it about the same color and just be a little 
uh yeah rollers are so messy 
we never mess with them anymore 
oh i know 
but it 's that it 's the textured wall he can still 
well still a paintbrush 
okay um 
we 're guess we 're supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time 
um-hum 
um i basically read books 
uh-huh 
what 
i do 
sometimes when everybody 's off gone to bed my kids are in bed my husband in bed i just every once in a while i 'll just stay up and finish a book that i 'm 
i usually have about three books that i 'm going on 
i 'll work on one for a little bit you know and then on the next one 
but that 's kind of 
well that 's pretty impressive to have three books going 
not always 
just sometimes 
oh yeah 
and and what kind of books do you read 
um just really different ones 
um i had one that i was reading on um raising your children and another one on a on a biography and another one on a um um like a crime story 
oh yeah 
you know a truth crime story 
oh do you like those detective stories 
yeah 
but it this this is a true one 
it was this seemed a little different so 
i was reading that one last night 
oh well that 's interesting 
i- i actually like to read also 
but i usually fall into one of two categories either true science fiction or fantasy on one hand or highly technical 
yeah 
its like my husband 
yeah 
yeah 
kind of one or the other 
i 
you must uh work for ti 
i do 
yes 
yeah 
my husband does too 
yeah 
and i 'm a computer scientist 
yeah 
but i have a lot of other hobbies 
it gets uh-huh 
really 
i- i well yeah 
i- i i 'm kind of um i- i guess what you 'd call it a project person 
oh really 
yeah 
and i love 
i like i have a shop 
and when things break around the house i always try and fix them myself 
and so hobby 
i- i- it 's its funny uh 
from the one stand point it 's work 
but it 's a hobby too that that i enjoy to do 
yeah 
to find broken 
yeah 
like 
what kinds of things do you fix 
well essentially anything you 'd find in a house uh a a stove or an oven or a broken piece of porcelain or uh chipped tile on the floor i mean just anything 
oh 
and you have a shop 
well it 's it 's not anything elaborate 
it 's just a work bench with a gazillion tools 
yeah 
but enough that again for anything in the house i can probably 
yeah 
you can fix just about everything and anything 
right 
well that 's great 
and in the car 
i guess the car too 
yeah 
so that 's i- i think i would probably consider that a hobby although sometimes it gets to be excessive 
yeah 
yeah that 's that 's pretty much like my husband 
he 's he 's --- pretty uh mobile in that area too 
he he works on the cars 
we barely take them in he works on i- irons and all those tv 's and stuff too 
yeah 
i 
we rarely have to take those things in too 
right 
yeah 
i- i think it it it it not only can it be fun but it can certainly help your finances 
oh yeah 
yeah 
definitely 
so do you have any art- um i w- i guess i want to say creative or artistic hobbies 
um gosh not really 
i mean i during christmas i work on you know like um holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things 
oh yeah 
well that 's good 
but but um not really 
yeah 
well i do n't necessarily either 
i can plink out a song or two on a piano and i can um 
oh 
i- i do n't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art i guess graphics arts is that what that would be called it 
yeah 
yeah 
i can n't like do any of that 
but sweat shirts is certainly impressive 
uh-huh 
um i belong to this organization for um wi- if you have preschool children you know and uh every once and a while they 'll have a a craft um session for the moms and those are really neat 
um-hum 
oh yeah 
and we learned to do the um transfer pictures on the sweatshirts transfer photos and um those are really neat 
oh yeah 
uh-huh 
so we learn different crafts like that um 
i see 
well that 's neat 
yeah 
that 's a i guess i consider that a hobby 
do you do you cook for a hobby 
or do you 
no 
i cook dinner 
do you that 's something you 
and its not i do n't consider it a hobby 
i understand that 
but um you know i 
no 
i 'm not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately 
yeah 
i like to bake off and on 
and usually once a week i 'll bake something 
but its not anything elaborate you know 
uh right 
at least i do n't think it is 
yeah 
so 
but i think that still borders on hobby 
yeah 
probably the other thing i do which i 'm sure it 'll sound horrible to you but is i program for fun on my computer 
uh-huh 
so i 'll i have little projects little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies but drive my wife crazy 
uh-huh 
oh 
well good 
you have a computer at home 
i do 
yes 
oh good 
yeah 
in fact there 's actually several of them here right now 
oh really 
not not all of them being mine 
wow 
then you are busy 
yeah 
wow 
that 's really good 
so uh i wonder if you you could construe raising children as being a hobby 
well you know one of the books that i did r- that i was reading 
and i stopped because it 's so its the book is so detailed and you have to sometimes i have to go back and read the page over again because i did n't quite get it all 
um-hum 
and uh it is so detailed 
are you there 
um-hum 
okay 
now tell me your favorite team 
uh baseball 
yes 
well i 've been kind of been intrigued with the rangers uh more so with uh uh their management than anything else 
i 'd i do n't follow baseball that that closely 
but uh si- you know since i live here so close to arlington uh that 's the team that i 've been kind of following 
okay 
i think it 's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us 
where do you think they 're headed 
so we 'll have to talk about the future with the rangers 
um-hum 
right 
what are your thinkings on what they can do what they 'll be able to do 
well i think that uh you know with uh so much controversy over ruben sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it 's um you know i think 
i 'm not real sure about th- 
do you know anything about ruben sierra 's uh 
well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his 
yeah 
that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the rangers will go up a little bit yeah 
yes 
and the rangers go up a little bit 
um-hum 
but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty five mill- 
that 's a lot of money 
i think the entire baseball 
yeah 
they 're the ones that probably are paying the highest 
yeah 
they are 
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous 
um-hum 
no 
and i really think i really think that uh that they ought to 
i 'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money 
i think they should uh uh pay him what his salary 's going to be uh and let him 
because he 's got one more year before he turns into a a free agent 
that 's right 
and then uh who knows 
if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway 
but if he does n't then his market value will go down 
and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the si- you know the six million dollars a year this year 
what i saw on the news today that 
bue- buechele was back just to visit 
uh-huh 
i 'm awful sorry he 's not still 
oh yeah 
but you know what he 
that was a great deal for him 
oh i 'm sure it was 
yeah 
it was a great deal for him 
and and uh he just signed on uh 
i think it was like a five year deal with uh pittsburgh 
pittsburgh 
yeah 
so you know he 's real happy there 
as far as the rangers are concerned i think i think they need some definitely need some pitching 
yes sir 
uh and so i you know i 
well what do you think of howse who is the coach for the pitchers 
um the pitching coach 
yes 
well you know i was just looking at the news tonight 
and they showed a a a black guy that was go- was helping out uh his assistant 
his assistant 
um-hum 
and i think that 's a a great addition 
i mean he seemed to know what he was doing 
and and uh 
i really wish they could see fit to get rid of howse 
oh you do n't like howse huh 
no 
no 
i really do n't 
and i 'm not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that 
but i 'm not fond of howse 
and i 'm not fond of grieves 
oh tom grieve 
yeah 
yeah 
i 'm i 'm not sure that um that they 're ready to get rid of of uh tom grieve yet 
but howse might be a different uh situation 
and i think you 're probably right that they that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe 
and um 
well i 'm just gullible enough that i think bobby valentine is um uh doing all right 
and i 'm sure 
you do huh 
well 
that 's contrary to uh popular belief you know 
oh i know 
i know so 
but i would like so much for these rangers to get their act together and give um oh uh nolan ryan the support he needs 
oh i know 
you know it 's too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the rangers you know 
i understand 
they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead 
and and 
uh yeah 
well i just oh i have so many mixed emotions about all this 
but i think with their new stadium they should go and let 's us ha- 
i guess you heard our con- our topic for today was clothing 
right 
yeah i certainly did 
how you dress for work and season to season and everything 
uh uh-huh 
how do you dress for work 
well uh uh about the same i dress for school 
i uh i i 'm a gr- i 'm a graduate student 
so i do n't have to worry too much about uh what i wear too much of the time uh which is nice uh uh i 've uh although i do uh a lot of 
sure 
you bet 
i 'm a speech pathology major 
and so i do a lot of clinical work 
and when i do clinic work then i have to uh uh look my best 
look professional 
yeah 
unfortunately 
yeah 
i understand 
i 'm a 
i own my own company 
i 'm in the i 'm a manufactures rep sales organization 
and my office is a small office 
and i 'm very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt things like that but then when i travel it 's a little different situation 
um-hum 
um-hum yeah 
sure 
it 's uh suit and sports coat tie and the whole bit because you go to meetings and you 're required to look your best and look professional of course 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yeah 
uh d- uh do you find that uh on the average do people give uh more credibility or less credibility to a to a professional to p- professionally dressed individual 
yeah 
i think in today 's society uh there 's more credibility quite honest i 'll always remember 
um-hum 
i 'll tell this real quick story when i graduated college 
my first job years ago uh thirty years ago tw- twenty nine years ago in fact was selling uh agricultural fertilizer 
uh-huh 
i worked for the uh smith douglas division of borden chemical 
and i sold uh you know manure 
uh-huh 
and uh i would go out and call on farmers 
and i was always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that 
but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls 
uh-huh 
and so one day i got up and thought well i 'll just go casual 
and do you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls 
and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional and uh he sort of expected me to dress as a professional so uh it was sort of 
uh-huh 
oh really 
e- even the farmers 
was you bet even even back then 
oh wow 
so i 've sort a uh been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best 
um-hum 
but but here again i dress casual quite a bit 
so 
uh-huh 
yeah 
certainly 
it depends on who you call 
on in my business if i call on the the jc penney company here in dallas or say someone say sears and roebuck in chicago then i wear coat and tie 
if i call on just uh a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual 
uh-huh 
i call on oshman 's sporting goods again it may be casual 
or it may be coat and tie 
so it just it it depends 
uh-huh yeah 
it depends 
sure 
uh so you do n't you uh 
if you had the choice would you wear a tie or no 
um probably no 
uh-huh 
probably no because uh today i believe you can get away with 
um-hum 
it but then it depends on who you 're calling on who you 're it 'd 
be like your your minister standing up in front of you with no tie you just uh he 'd be missing something although he should n't be evaluated on that 
um-hum 
right 
right 
so it is it 's it 's just different 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that uh 
that 's uh if if you wanted to to uh really get into a hot issue uh 
well at least in some in some beliefs uh uh how people dress when they go to church is uh is uh sometimes a pretty pretty hot topic uh un- un- unfor- unfortunately 
yes 
it is 
i 'm uh lightly a catholic 
and the people uh that go to my church are you know 
the catholics dress very casual you 're liable to find 
um-hum 
people in jeans and and and whatever 
but yet the way i was raised 
i 'm a converted catholic 
the way i was raised 
i was raised a baptist 
and it seems like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time 
but i guess that has changed also 
uh-huh 
uh yeah 
i 'm i 'm a i- i go to the church of christ 
i 've been raised in church of christ 
and uh i- i uh too many times you you hear you hear a lot about wh- what you 're uh supposed you 're supposed to look your your sunday best and uh uh dress in proper attire 
right 
and uh and sometimes that really disappoints me uh in in uh when i see in other economic areas uh like in kentucky 
sure 
uh you know people just do n't have that 
and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because they do n't have the clothes to wear 
but 
at the ver- that 's a very good point 
i 'm from west virginia 
so i understand what you 're saying there and there it 's it 's just a very good point 
uh-huh 
yeah 
but uh you should n't what 's the old saying you should n't judge a book by its cover 
certainly 
and uh evaluation of of an individual of course i think it depends on the type of job responsibility you have 
i think you have to dress sort of accordingly 
um-hum 
but uh you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and uh or evaluate a person by that 
um-hum 
but what about season to season 
does 
i guess your dress changes 
um-hum um-hum uh yeah 
a little bit 
uh course in the summer if i can get away with it i wear uh uh a pair of shorts 
and that 's it 
run around barefoot no shirt or anything 
uh but uh 
well what kind of vacations do you like to take 
well we 've uh we 've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to europe 
so so i i guess those are the types i like 
are you uh-huh 
uh-huh 
we 've really enjoyed them 
yeah 
where have you gone there 
we 've gone to um germany switzerland austria ireland and england 
um-hum 
we 've been to germany twice 
uh-huh 
but um i guess my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland 
uh-huh 
yeah 
well i 've been over there too 
uh-huh 
where have you been 
i even 
let 's see um 
mostly germany and france 
uh-huh 
i lived in france for a year and a half 
so i was able 
oh how neat 
but i loved when i had a chance in france to go on vacation instead of traveling around france i went to germany because uh i 've got relatives there 
uh-huh 
and i just like it there 
oh that 's neat 
uh-huh 
so but um austria i found really pretty and switzerland 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and i i lived in the alps in france 
so i anything in the mountains over there i just love 
oh how neat 
oh yeah 
then i finally made it to england too um on my way home um 
so i lived in africa actually 
and on my way home from there 
you lived in africa 
yeah 
oh my goodness 
yeah 
wow 
so um and you always have to go out fly through or unless you fly from nairobi you have to fly through um uh europe on your way home 
uh-huh 
so i went to england 
and i really liked it there too 
it 's so expensive over there 
i know 
it 's true 
that 's the one thing 
it really is 
it just it 's it 's 
i love to go over there 
but it 's so darn expensive to go over 
yeah 
yeah 
actually now you can get some really good deals flying over 
but it 's once you 're there you still have to spend money 
yeah 
oh i know 
just 
unless you know people you know 
right 
and you can stay with them 
and yeah 
uh-huh 
an- that helps a lot 
yeah 
but 
you know there 's a lot of places in the states that we have n't even gone 
uh-huh 
you know i 'd like to go to hawaii sometime 
and and uh w- we made it 
yeah 
we 've we 've at least gone to the grand canyon and niagara falls 
so 
uh-huh 
yeah 
feel like we 've accomplished a little bit here 
i have n't 
i 've been i 've 
most of my vacationing in the us has been on the west coast or this summer i went to colorado and uh i 'd love to go to the east coast during the fall 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
the oh the 
it 's oh 
i 've always wanted to go there 
i 've seen pictures 
and and it looks gorgeous 
yeah 
we um we made a trip up the east coast 
it was uh in the summer and it really is pretty 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
it 's uh 
both coasts are really pretty but um i love the carolinas 
yeah 
it 's just gorgeous over there 
uh-huh 
i have n't been there anywhere on the east coast 
yeah 
i i think tennessee 's been the furthest east i 've been 
yeah uh-huh 
yeah 
well you 'll just have to plan a vacation sometime an- an- go over there 
yeah 
i guess so 
yeah 
but it 's you know there 's lots to see here but i just love going over to europe because it 's so their way of life is just so different than ours 
uh-huh 
yeah 
you know we 're so fast paced here 
and over there you know every time we 'd go and and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we always have to ask for the check you know they 're so leisurely over there and it 's kind of nice to to have that 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
so the type of vacation you 'd like i 
mean like would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week 
well usually a bunch of different places 
yeah 
main- mainly probably because you want to see everything 
right 
see as much as you can while you 're there 
and yeah 
yeah 
i know 
yeah 
how 
how did you like africa 
it is well i liked it 
um i was working in cameroon africa and it 's not a it 's not a place for tourists 
uh-huh 
i mean they 're not used to having tourists there 
so it 's 
uh-huh 
you 're kind of roughing it 
but um i liked it 
i liked it 
uh-huh 
the people there are just very very friendly 
and 
what type of work 
um i was working with an organization that does bible translation 
oh okay 
so i was doing linguistic work actually traveling around finding out about languages and uh what they call survey work 
oh uh-huh 
uh-huh 
find out where the languages are 
uh-huh 
so i traveled a lot a- around the country and met a lot of people 
yeah 
and um 
that 's neat 
yeah 
i enjoyed it 
so 
i 've i 've always um i 've talked to people who 've been to africa 
and they 
and then of course when that movie out of africa came out 
yeah 
um but i 've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there 
yeah 
my cousin came over while i was there 
and she came to cameroon 
then she went over to nairobi and took a safari around you know close to nairobi in kenya 
uh-huh 
oh how neat 
so she 'd always dreamed of doing that too 
yeah 
that 's great 
so yeah 
so is there anyplace you would try to talk me into going to 
um 
it sounds like we 've been to some of the same places but 
yeah 
it doe- 
okay 
it 's pressed 
are you still there 
i 'm ready 
okay 
so what 's uh things that you look for when you go out to dinner 
oh i just like a nice quiet nice atmosphere and of course good food 
um-hum 
that 's always that 's always a concern 
but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something just to relax you know because i do n't really go out to dinner that much 
um 
um that sounds pretty 
yeah 
so 
um-hum 
well we do n't go out to dinner that much either 
we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that 
uh-huh 
but i definitely want to go to a place that 's nice and clean you know 
right 
um i 've been to some that 's been terrible 
you know you see cockroaches crawling around and everything you know 
oh 
but i try to get one that 's nice and clean 
and then i like to you know good food and good service 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
where you do n't feel rushed you know and you can just relax and stay as long as you want 
yeah 
right 
right 
right 
so is there some nice places to go to eat in plano 
and well nearby 
we 're almost in dallas 
we 're just north of dallas 
um-hum 
so we have quite a bit between us and there 
it 's about ten miles and there is all kinds of restaurants 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and i had one that was a favorite for a long time 
and then it changed hands and doubled the prices 
and then it finally went out of business 
um 
so but it was really nice 
it had a fireplace 
um that sounds beautiful 
and yeah 
it was really nice 
they had entertainment sometimes 
and y- you could just really relax there and enjoy it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
well 
but it 's gone 
this is only a little small city 
um we have uh 
excuse me 
i did n't think my coughing would come back 
anyhow we have only like one uh restaurant that 's kind of nice 
you know they have prime rib on uh weekends and th- then they have a about six miles from here is called a little city called wesley 
uh-huh 
and they have a wesley hotel there that they serve food 
and the atmosphere there is really really nice 
oh that 's nice 
so and then if we really want to you know something different then we go to modesto which is like twenty minutes away 
uh-huh 
right 
but uh we do n't have any fast foods here in this small city 
that 's probably very fortunate for you 
do you have kids 
do i have kids 
yeah 
well i have a son 
but he 's grown up 
oh because i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night you know 
and now she 's graduated to two cheeseburgers 
um-hum 
so something 's happened here 
but but um you know mcdonald 's is definitely at the top of her list 
and i hate these places 
yeah 
all the kids seem to love mcdonald 's do n't they you know 
so uh-huh 
they do 
and i do n't think there 's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have 
no 
no 
i 'm sure there is n't 
so so we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around and it 's really it 's tempting when you come home from work and you 're tired 
um-hum 
and you know you just are tempted to give in to that 
and it costs a lot of money to do it too 
i know 
you know it adds up 
and it 's not healthy 
and i- i really got into that habit for a while 
but i got out of it again because i just felt like it was just too unhealthy 
it 's yeah 
yeah 
um-hum 
so 
well let 's see 
what else can we talk about 
well how 's california today 
oh it 's foggy and cold here 
is it 
that 's what i 've heard 
yeah 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
it 's 
yeah have you always lived there 
i came from iowa when i was sixteen so i 've lived out in california for a long long time 
oh 
and you like it 
yeah 
i like it real well 
yeah 
we 've been 
we used to live in oakland 
so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there you know 
oh yeah 
but uh then i quit work and everything 
and i mo- bought a house 
i had a condo in oakland so right in chinatown 
so we went to a lots of restaurants and chinese restaurants 
uh-huh oh that would be fun 
and they were really good 
i really miss them you know 
yeah 
do you miss living there 
uh no 
i really do n't miss living there 
no 
i just like to go in there and have a nice chinese dinner once in a while you know 
yeah 
yeah 
but um as far as missing living there no 
hum 
it 's close enough if i wanted to go there to san francisco for dinner or something why you know an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know have dinner and then come on back 
yeah 
but uh have you ever been to california 
uh-huh oh yeah 
i- i go all the time 
oh really 
yeah 
well i have a twenty one year old daughter in college there and she um is world champion twirler and her coach is in california 
um 
um-hum 
so she went there for six years 
um 
so i went out a lot with her 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and uh yeah 
i know california pretty well 
um-hum 
and i love it 
and we tug back and forth who 's going to move 
but i think he 's going to move because i 'm the person with more to lose here 
yeah i guess um-hum 
i have my twelve year old in school and she 's happy 
um-hum 
she 's always lived here in the south 
and i 've had my house 
so i 've too much to lo- 
um-hum 
well i was just wondering if you had had any experience with um the care of the elderly 
yes 
i have 
in fact uh just a little over just a little less than a year ago uh my mother went to be with the lord 
and we cared for her the last uh oh seventeen months of her life here in the at home aside from uh having to uh take her to the hospital 
uh-huh 
and uh you know those times well she was there in the the regular hospital 
right 
and then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer 
and so the doctor elected to have her uh finish out uh in the hospice program 
um-hum 
and uh i as far as i 'm concerned that is far and above any nursing home because uh she 's around her own fa- you know the the elderly parent in question is around their own family 
the uh hospice program provides a hospital type bed well it is a hospital bed and all the oxygen stuff and a uh and a visiting nurse at least every other day et cetera et cetera et cetera 
well that 's nice 
and it 's all taken care of by by uh medicare uh 
and uh it it 's it 's really neat uh 
and i you know i would n't i would n't banish uh my old loved one to a to a warehouse 
no 
and that 's that 's what i basically uh view a nursing home as a warehouse 
so that 's 
it 's really sad 
pardon me 
it 's really a sad situation 
uh-huh 
and uh i think a lot of people struggle with 
uh i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever you know the parent is does n't always want the in-law living in the house 
no oh 
um-hum 
is that right 
right 
well that 's really sad 
yeah 
i know 
but uh in this case uh spouse and i uh are uh we 're are are are uh united in this area because i guess her father her grandfather and grandmother both lived with uh her parents uh th- th- their golden years to 
um-hum 
so this is n't like uh uh just one one uh instance 
um-hum 
in fact uh her uh uh experiences were were invaluable to me 
um-hum 
uh in fact i do n't know if i could have uh held up uh you know without my wife uh helping in this this this case 
right 
yes 
well i know when the i remember being a child 
and my grandmother had had se- several strokes and things and that we had my parents tried to keep her in the house 
and they did for a long time i could n't tell you how long until she got uh where she had to have complete care 
uh-huh 
and j- they could n't you know keep her in the house anymore 
uh-huh 
and it was really hard on everyone 
that she had to have you know twenty four hour a day care 
and i do n't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and that um they put her there 
and we all went just constantly until she died 
oh okay 
but it was very hard on everyone to see w- you know grandmother be like that 
and i do n't know that you know i do n't being so young i do n't remember why you know what was why she had to go there 
um-hum 
well maybe uh uh well as as you say the the care of of grandmother or was was to such that such mom and dad could n't handle it 
um-hum 
well i do remember that she was you know totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way 
oh boy 
yeah 
and that that they could n't they found that they could not you know give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
well then then there 's almost then there 's almost no no uh uh choice left to her then 
no 
but like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though you know in the nursing home 
uh-huh 
i do remember the other patients there um being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother because they got some interaction with someone 
right 
in fact just to just to sit and chat with them for five minutes and and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is 
um-hum 
right 
right 
and i guess that 's hard on people to give give up their lives 
if they 're busy they do n't you know 
um-hum 
it 's easy to abandon people because we do have the nursing homes i guess 
right 
if you can afford them 
but anyway well i 'm glad it worked out good for your family 
and then and 
oh yeah 
it did 
and i was just pr- i just praised the lord that that we were able to uh have uh uh be 
did you hear our topic 
and it 's in regards to discussing homes 
homes 
yes sir 
um-hum 
what are are you settled in a place 
yeah 
i 'm settled in a place 
i 've been in it for twelve years since nineteen uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy eight 
in it 's in richardson texas which is north texas or north dallas 
right 
um-hum 
and we 've lived in two houses in richardson 
we moved here in seventy four and uh changed locations in seventy eight 
okay 
how about yourself 
well we uh left here in seventy six 
uh we were here for a few years 
then we uh have come back just this summer 
right now we 're looking for housing uh somewhere down in the duncanville and cedar hill area 
are you familiar that 
yes 
nice area 
yeah 
it is 
the kids are in school here in duncanville 
we 're in a temporary place right now 
and uh so they 've enjoyed the school 
so we 're kind of trying to stay here 
but 
are you finding it tough trying to find what you want 
or 
well what the problem we got is that we 've got five children and so uh we really want four or five bedroom house 
oh boy 
and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing 
r- right 
so we uh we look at the paper 
we look at our talk to our realtor 
and you can cut you know the listings uh in about a third and when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five 
sure 
are you looking 
or you settled 
i mean 
no 
we 're settled 
and uh we 're uh 
h- having 
i 'm probably older than you 
i 'm fifty two 
but anyway i my youngest is getting married this year and graduating college 
finished oh great 
so i can board up their rooms and look forward to retirement maybe 
that empty nest syndrome is going to set in i guess 
oh gosh 
so we 're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to florida or somewhere closer closer to our families 
great 
okay 
okay 
you are you from florida originally 
no 
i 'm from west virginia 
but everyone 's uh my wife 's parents are from the new york new jersey area so but everyone seems uh has seemed to relocated down that area 
yeah 
oh yeah 
seems like a nice place to go 
yeah 
yeah 
we 've got five 
and the oldest is uh ninth grade 
and the youngest is second grade 
and i think they 're going to be uh with us forever 
i do n't know if that 's true 
but it 's sure you know w- we 're not anywhere near looking to uh uh cut down in size 
we 're we 're trying to find 
oh i understand 
you need very minimum of four and probably five 
the oh yeah 
in fact six would be real good 
as far right 
my wife and i can share a bedroom 
it 's tough to find a five and six room bedroom house is n't it 
and 
there oh i do n't think it 's possible unless you you know multimillionaire something like that 
oh i know 
yeah 
seems like when you get in that category you 're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever 
and it 's that 's an awful lot you know 
oh yeah 
yeah 
it is 
yeah 
we- um we 're having 
actually if we find something for uh i 'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we 'll be doing all right you know 
right 
that 's uh 
but i think the thing 's out there 
it 's just a matter of uh you know looking you know finding the right place uh 
matter of looking 
right 
lot of people will buy a f- in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do or do something 
i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school 
and she had uh there were seven kids in her family 
wow 
and they converted the dining room and and did this and that 
they always seemed to get along fine you know 
oh yeah 
yeah 
i think once we get into a place it 'll be just fine 
but um you know it 's until then it 's uh oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing 
oh sure 
oh i know 
and it 's there 's nothing harder than that 
i always just sort of a assign my wife that chore 
then i would let her narrow it down to three or four 
then i 'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do 
that 's all oh yeah 
maybe that 's the case 
at least she 's got more opinions you know 
there 's uh seems like there 's more constraints more things that she thinks about you know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know 
yes 
why certainly 
i understand that 
so wha- what kind of business are you in 
i 'm in the uh sporting goods business 
i 'm a manufacturer 's rep 
i represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies 
oh yeah 
great 
wh- who are you with 
uh we 're with an organization called uh wycliffe bible translators 
uh-huh 
it 's a a missions organization and uh doing uh translation linguistics that sort of thing 
well great 
uh it 's got an office down here in uh it near duncanville 
and we just moved down to be on staff down here 
so 
how how was the uh 
you s- you say you lived in the denver area before 
it right 
how did that compare with this area as far as hous- housing prices 
uh we were uh really surprised to find that they 're higher here uh 
no kidding 
when we moved from louisiana to denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh i guess almost two or three times as high as we 'd expected 
and then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower 
and they 're not 
i guess um really prices for housing are just 
so i 've been concerned about crime lately 
um-hum 
um it 's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems 
um-hum 
i wondered i- you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood 
well i- i think we have a neighborhood watch 
uh-huh 
i think 
i 'm not real 
we do n't get real involved 
we 're never home 
so um uh well i know they were going to start one 
uh-huh 
but uh i have n't heard any more since 
so i do n't really know 
but as far as personally doing something no 
no hm 
how about you 
well we moved in when we moved in there there was n't any outside lights 
and so we 've been trying to install some um outside lights 
uh-huh 
and we put up a fence in the backyard 
uh-huh 
mostly you know not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in but that our children would be safe playing in the yard you know 
yeah 
yeah 
huh 
and i guess most of the crime that i 'm concerned about generally is against m- my kids 
it 's scary to send them off down the street a few houses 
oh i 'm sure it is 
to let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and so i have to spend a good deal of time watching them walk down the street and say call me before you leave and come back 
um-hum 
uh 
and 
i would too if i had kids 
we do n't have any 
we did install a um a uh motion detector light back in our driveway 
um-hum 
and that was mainly it was so when we pulled up the light would come on 
but also we have a boat back there and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief 
um-hum 
so we thought with that light you know it would maybe keep them from doing something to the boat 
oh no then that 's a good thought 
yeah 
so 
well we 've been real lucky that 
i do n't believe there 's been you know much trouble in our neighborhood 
but it but it does seem there that there is a lot more here in plano of um just bored teenagers 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's what it is 
vandalism 
we live in coppell 
and and that 's pretty much what it is is you know kids that are bored like you say 
um-hum 
but yeah 
and they do n't uh 
i know my sister-in-law who lives in our neighborhood they 've had their 
uh-huh 
they 've parked their car out on the street before 
and it 's been spray painted and a few things like that 
oh no 
and course you know 
i do n't know 
i 'm getting scared for the kids to get older because you do n't know if it 's someone their teenagers know who and or is it just random crime 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but um we 've been real lucky that no one in my family with the anywhere that they live has had been a victim of you know a serious crime 
yeah 
yeah 
but uh it 's really scary to know that y- you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it does n't mean you 'll be safe 
uh-huh 
and but i guess i take a lot of um little bit of um safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are like drug related or um things that places usually that i would n't be going and things i usually would n't be involved in 
uh-huh 
i know it 
hm um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah yeah 
and uh there 's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to 
huh yeah 
but it is scary 
yeah 
it is 
were you raised in this area 
it really is 
yeah 
i 'm originally from chicago 
but i 've been in this area in the louisville area for uh let 's see about twenty three years 
hm um-hum 
so has it been getting worse that you 've noticed or about the same 
oh definitely 
hm 
in the last few years i think 
and uh like i say 
now i do n't think necessarily in this area here 
but just dallas in general 
um-hum 
i do n't know 
i think back of when i was uh younger and in my party days some of those things i did you know 
i would n't be caught dead like being out that late at night in a dark parking lot 
right 
right 
take a lot of chances 
well i noticed that um that uh when 
we we moved here from houston not too long ago 
so uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and so of course we were interested in schools and um but the schools in houston all have big tall fences around them 
um-hum 
and they 're not really very safe and so it 's been interesting to come to the plano area where the schools do n't have fences at all around them 
uh-huh 
and it 's just a whole different idea that that at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school 
uh-huh 
and in houston that there was the mentality that they were n't safe at school 
huh 
and so that 's been something that 's been good for the you know in this area that you feel like um you know there 's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and i guess 
i do n't know how people live with that everyday 
um 
i do n't either 
pretty scary 
yeah hm hm 
but anyway well i guess i wo n't take up more of your ti- 
i uh spent four years as a university professor 
oh really 
and 
yeah 
i i 've spent three years 
um teaching in public schools and elementary school 
oh do you really 
uh-huh 
that 's great 
i taught in utah 
and uh did you teach in california 
no kidding 
w- 
i did 
uh-huh 
i did um 
you sound pretty young for a university professor 
well i was pretty young 
w- i was uh 
i had never intended to do it 
and i was uh uh given the opportunity after i 'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in uh uh one of the business schools in the california state university system 
uh-huh 
at any rate um the topic is fascinating because one of the things i 've done for the past few years is um research the problem from the point of view of uh uh what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically 
um-hum 
you may be familiar with cooperative learning 
have you ever 
well you can you can tell me a little bit more about it because i do n't think we did that in utah 
well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools 
and uh what what it involves basically is the use of peer groups 
and the uh teacher becomes a uh a sort of a consultant resource person to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives i guess they 're called 
uh-huh 
and there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh gain a competence with respect to the material 
uh-huh 
um i think that the combination of uh technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn 
uh i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster 
uh school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators and uh both teachers and parents uh complain about the uh uh the cost and ineffectiveness that results 
uh-huh 
so my feeling is that um the the problem is is uh significant 
there are plenty of good people uh available to um offer people educational experience 
but that we just have to re- reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it 
and uh i think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research um uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning 
uh-huh 
and my feeling is that uh those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually 
i do n't know what form it 'll ultimately take 
um uh but i think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we 're paying an enormous price for uh inferior quality when the people involved really are n't inferior 
so it must be the way we 're managing the process that uh 
yeah 
true um-hum um-hum yeah i see what you 're saying 
yeah 
i totally agree 
i- i do n't i do n't think it 's it 's a matter of of uh talented people to do it a- both as quote unquote students and as teachers 
but clearly what 's happened in this country is the school system 's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that were n't existent uh 
oh yeah 
uh-huh 
you must see kids with real significant problems um in some cases 
uh course iowa city 
i do n't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in iowa city 
is it is it uh deteriorated a lot 
do the people say 
or are they pretty happy with it 
or 
well i 've i have n't taught in iowa 
but i 've taught in utah 
and um people there were saying that the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to home where they taught their kids at home or you know anything but the public schools and the ones that did have you know the kids 
right 
even in utah 
yeah 
well well uh maybe it was the area i was in 
well utah 's a place where you would n't think that problem would be very severe 
but a lot of schools had lot of transient um families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side 
and 
yeah 
you s- you saw a fair number of troubled kids 
yeah 
and i mean like you said how they were the schools were doing more things for the kids they thought than they were thirty years ago 
i mean they were the school i was teaching at the the year i left they 're considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids 
yeah 
yeah 
as well as hot lunch 
and 
what are your favorite tv shows 
um i guess one of my favorite ones is cheers 
yeah 
i always liked that one 
they 're always so funny 
and i also like the cosby show 
yeah 
yeah 
those are probably my two favorites 
yeah 
i- i- i rather enjoy the cosby show 
my wife and i both like commish 
you know i 've watched that one time 
and it was really good 
but now that 's on what saturday night 
uh 
is it saturday 
it 's either friday night it 's either tonight or tomorrow night um around here at least 
uh-huh 
i guess it depends on what channel you 're getting you know what system you 're getting it through 
i can n't 
i can n't remember uh-huh 
yeah 
i yeah i saw it one time 
and i really liked it 
but i just have n't uh seen it you know watched it since 
uh we we always enjoyed it 
it it seems to be kind of halfway between um something like all in the family and uh hill street blues 
yeah 
uh i- i- i- it 's a good show 
yeah 
the episode that i watched um i liked him because even though he 's a law enforcement officer you know sometimes the laws are kind of ridiculous and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason 
you tend 
yeah 
yeah 
and he seems to do that sometimes 
h- he tenderhearted fellow 
yeah 
yeah 
i- i guess that 's what first drew us to him 
the uh the the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours 
uh-huh 
but uh 
yeah 
i thought it was a pretty good show 
yeah 
yeah um yeah um 
i also like i- i like to watch like sixty minutes and twenty twenty 
i do n't know we uh watch commish any chance we get 
uh-huh 
um used to be a big fan of star trek 
but that 's kind of 
th- th- it 's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against um anything spiritual 
uh-huh 
but uh anyway 
i 've never gotten into the star trek era 
yeah 
i- i used to be a used to be a real big fan of star trek 
used to be a trekkie huh 
um pretty much 
yeah 
uh-huh 
i always enjoyed the show anyway 
yeah 
and star trek 's in a s- 
the uh star wars set uh the one of the first star wars movie 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i think i watched it something like nineteen times 
oh my goodness 
you must have some of the lines memorized 
uh i did at one time 
anyway 
wow 
oh a pretty big fan of that sort of thing used to used to read a read a lot of science fiction work too 
yeah 
uh-huh 
but uh no 
it um 
we do n't do a whole lot of tv watching 
but that uh 
i do n't know if you heard him or not 
they got a twelve year old twelve week old baby 
twelve week oh 
i was going to say i hear a baby in the background 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that between that and school it 's not between him and school there 's not much time left for watching much tv 
i imagine that keeps you busy 
yeah 
well we 're we 're expecting our first in about three months 
so i know we wo n't be watching as much as we do now 
yeah 
this one here is our first 
a- and we 're both full time students 
so 
oh wow 
yeah 
that must be tough 
what are you hoping for 
a boy or a girl 
it does n't matter 
just a healthy baby 
that that 's that 's the best way 
y- you have n't found out yet or anything have you 
well we had a sonogram 
but we told him not to tell us 
so it 's going to be a surprise 
yeah 
that 's the best way 
yeah 
i mean it 's like finding out somewhere in july what you 're going to get for christmas 
i mean you know it 's it 's it 's not as much fun 
yeah 
it- it 's not quite the same 
oh 
yeah 
anyway 
i agree 
i 'm sure we 'll be watching more uh children oriented television shows 
yeah oh i 'm about half kid heart anyway 
oh i am too 
i- i well 
i still watch cartoons sometimes every once in a while when my sister comes to visit 
so 
the new cartoons do n't seem to be worth much 
but the uh 
well a couple of the uh ones disney 's doing are n't too bad 
but 
well you know it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be 
oh yeah 
you know i remember like the flintstones and the jetsons 
and those were just kind of good old cartoons 
yeah 
the the the worst of the violence in the flintstones was when somebody gave fred a poke in the snoot 
yeah 
but oh shoot 
i mean blowing up galaxies and and putting a curse on the whole planet or or or you know or on all the you know everything of this species you know just all kinds of crud 
yep 
yeah 
and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays 
yeah 
everything 's mutations and and and killing and 
yeah 
um-hum 
gone are the days of those things they use 
what was it i uh 
uh tn- uh turner broadcasting network used to used to uh do the saturday morning and sunday morning cartoons the old cartoons they used to put between the first and second feature feature at the theatre those old little ten minute jobs where the uh the real ballooned looking art work you know a- and 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
well i suppose we both have credit cards 
um-hum 
yeah 
they seem to be a part of life 
yeah 
yeah 
how do you use them 
well i do use them 
um-hum 
um i have a few favorites that i use more than others 
and uh i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable 
i- i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to 
um-hum 
um but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and uh they all can build up 
um-hum 
um-hum 
uh i think they 're handy 
i just get uh 
i do n't carry a lot of cash with me and uh i hate writing checks when you go shopping 
um-hum 
yeah 
um-hum 
well do you use credit cards 
yeah 
i use a few 
i um i watched my grandmother go into debt on them 
um-hum 
and so i 've 
and then i guess my mother 
your grandmother huh 
yeah 
so my mother learned from that 
and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them 
so basically um i just keep them 
i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know 
um-hum 
but otherwise um i generally 
and my husband it turns out 
i 've just been married seven months 
but he has the same habit 
and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something 
that 's good 
but we always pay it off right that month so that we do n't pay any service charge 
oh that 's that 's wonderful 
so that way we keep out of debt 
and we keep on top of what we 're spending 
well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you 're savings is bringing 
yeah 
it 's really i guess ridiculous to let them keep building 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's what i feel 
so 
but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand 
um-hum 
it 's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that 
i try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where i know that the bill 's going to come 
but sometimes i forget 
and so you know a bill will come in 
and i 'll think oh no i did n't know it was going to be that high 
um-hum 
um yeah 
but so far i 've been able to we 've been able to pay it off every time 
so 
well that 's good 
i 'm looking right now i 'm k- kind of looking for a visa that has a lower interest rate 
it seems that some of them have gotten higher and uh i saw on tv they had a program on uh credit cards 
uh-huh 
and they 're supposed to 
i do n't know if it was tennessee or arkansas or some some other state had a visa card that was the lowest one in the country 
and i did n't write it down at the time 
um-hum 
and then i went and looked and to see what my visa was 
and i think it 's eighteen percent or something so think i want to find something that has a lower rate 
um 
yeah 
have you ever used discover card 
no 
i have n't 
yeah 
i 'm not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off 
but you know 
is is that the one from sears 
um i think sears originally put it out 
okay 
but it 's um it 's pretty well taken all over the us now 
i mean uh i 've have n't found many places that do n't take discover 
and there 's no annual service fee which is good 
okay 
you know and then um they also give you they say cash back um like at the end of the year 
for the amount that i charge i get two dollars back or something but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back 
uh-huh 
oh oh they give you money back for using your credit card 
yeah 
basically 
oh i did n't know that 
that 's it 
and i think the service charge is pretty low too 
but i 'm not sure 
hum well you know sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards 
uh-huh 
i worked w- at sears for over ten years 
and uh it was only a sears card that they would take until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
so you know now they 'll take the discover 
but i still do n't know if sears will take visa or mastercard 
um-hum 
but uh i never did apply for a discover card 
yeah 
i just figure with the visa and american express i probably have an 
um-hum 
i can do enough damage with those two 
yeah 
i think it 's best to keep the number down that you have 
um-hum 
yeah 
so 
i 've got some that i you know i have n't even used at all uh past few years 
i probably would n't be able to use them 
um-hum 
but uh i- i do like my dillard 's 
i have to admit that 's one of my favorite places to shop 
uh-huh 
and i d- do use dillard 's probably as more than any of the other department stores 
um-hum 
but 
yeah 
well do you have anything else to say 
well 
yes no 
not too much more about credit cards 
or okay 
i do n't think i do either 
so 
okay 
well 
well it was good talking to you 
good talking to you beth 
okay 
good luck 
have a good evening 
you too 
bye-bye 
bye 
yeah as far as i 'm concerned and probably apt that your call 's at this time because we just got through watching uh reasonable doubts which had a you know capital case in it 
uh-huh 
and uh m- i personally have uh 
my own feelings about uh the capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony 
i do too 
mandatory i mean summary execution on the steps that day 
um-hum 
why is it you know i- i 'm i 'm in that same 
i think if it 's uh if it 's a con- if it 's a convicted uh felon on parole uh and he goes out and and commits another crime or kills somebody i you know i- i feel the same way 
um-hum 
i do n't think i think that person is is beyond uh rehabilitation 
and and he should be taken out 
well i- i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation 
uh-huh 
but i do know that some people almost all people usually die before that point 
um-hum 
they just get too old 
um-hum 
um as far as capital punishment on on it 's own merits i have the trouble with the way it 's applied 
i think it should be applied on a little bit more fair manner 
uh and i 've i 've said this very often 
and i believe it to be the a a very true axiom 
so i would be rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent because if you 're if you 're black and you kill a white guy you 're going to fry 
uh-huh 
right 
period they will kill you 
yeah 
if you 're black and you kill a black guy you know it 's you know two hundred hours of community service 
yeah 
you do n't hear you do n't hear too much of that of those cases 
yeah well it 's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship you know 
yeah 
yeah 
we 're the majority 
so we can do whatever the hell we want to do 
that 's right 
and you 're the minority 
and you 're stuck with it 
huh 
but uh you know we had this in the vietnam war you know 
we had you know 
population of blacks among military people in vietnam was about eighty percent 
right 
but the population of blacks in the military was about twenty two percent 
huh 
the handwriting 's on the wall there is n't it 
yep 
it sure is 
you know but that 's another issue altogether 
yeah 
it 's 
a- as far as capital punishment i think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment 
i think the guy should have ninety days 
and if he can n't produce evidence not argument but evidence 
um-hum 
see the only thing i do n't you know i do n't understand i guess i- i do n't understand our judicial system uh as it is right now 
because i you know if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of ex- execution 
i mean how you know is there 
well 
th- that goes back to when uh america was a a colony of england 
um-hum 
in england you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty you know the judge said he 's guilty kill him 
well th- there were some people that uh had a problem with that because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed 
uh-huh 
right 
and he 'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me 
yeah 
and uh or he 'll have somebody lie for him 
you know people lie 
it 's a strange thing 
yeah 
but they do that 
and to prevent that kind of misuse of power they wrote into the constitution a protection against judicial mishap 
um-hum 
hm 
and the judicial mishap in this event would be hey you got the wrong guy 
look at that guy uh at e systems 
yep 
they were g- t- they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit 
yeah 
he was too far away when it happened 
he had witnesses that were you know they were n't dope dealers they were n't drug fiends they were employees of a an establishment that had a very high level of security sensitivity and these were really responsible people 
hm 
you know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy 
you know they all look the same to me you know 
yeah 
big lips flat nose yep that was him 
yep 
what do you think about um uh convicted um 
and i have to admit that we just moved to plano recently and that i had n't voted in an election yet 
and although i did go down and register and i 
that 's the first time i 've ever done that 
ha- what 's been your voting experience 
my voting experience 
well do you feel like uh 
i mean i 
i- i well personally i 've been very diligent until recent years when i felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
yes 
for the issues that you know that i felt really strong for um i think apathy has set in to a lot of people because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run 
um-hum 
that 's really true 
that 's kind of the way that i have felt 
it i also feel guilty um not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates 
course we only have mostly the representation given in the media 
but um i have felt since i 've been here that i have n't known what the issues were and that i because it was a new community 
you really do have to study to get yourself um up to par with what is truly going on and that takes a lot of research 
um-hum 
and and people today are very busy 
it does 
and uh and that is an excuse because we are we are always uh invo- 
yeah 
i know i 'm heavenly involved in other things and and to take time out and uh study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and i do n't have the time to devote to that and uh you hopefully -ll find that you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard 
um-hum 
um-hum 
no 
um-hum 
and unfortunately they are not 
no 
and uh it 's really a dilemma uh that we find ourselves in i believe 
um so i kind of just have taken a back step away and uh hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that 's there 
right 
um-hum 
take it 
i- because it is a task that is to me kind of overwhelming 
yes 
and uh and uh i also feel especially in the presidential elections that uh since we 're back on the old system of electoral votes and or that and that you do n't necessarily your vote does n't necessarily elect a president 
right 
they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes 
right 
and it 's kind of it 's awful 
yeah 
and and it 's hard to feel like one person 
but i know that it 's important 
and i feel guilty that i have n't done that here have n't taken the time 
and i know that you know people can make a difference 
but it 's hard to to face the corruption like you say and uh and to know what you 're up against 
and it makes me feel bad that 
i 'm glad i mean i am thankful for the uh nineteenth amendment that it gives women the right to vote 
and uh i 'm glad that that happened and everything 
yes 
and i hope that i will become a better make a better difference in 
but i have n't done that so far 
well i know that when you 're in a smaller community 
i live in mesquite and uh when we have uh a local election say for our mayor and so forth they really uh give a lot of information in the local newspaper not in the not in the bigger city dallas newspaper 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i mean they they just give it a small portion of the newspaper 
but the local newspaper really goes into uh quite a bit of history about the candidate and uh and then they have they raise a they raise two sides 
um-hum 
and uh there 's a pro and a con side and uh you can really um feel comfortable in uh evaluating that uh candidate by uh that method 
um-hum 
um-hum 
uh i feel pretty confident about the way it 's put forth 
now i would n't say that about the larger cities though and the and the country uh like the presidential 
um-hum 
right 
uh i mean they 've got people that are running that are admitted uh criminals and admitted crooks 
right 
right 
you know i 'm sorry 
but i do n't believe in them turning a good uh uh a new leaf unless they have the lord that has done that to them 
um-hum 
right 
and uh without the lord they can n't do it 
yeah 
and it 's not very likely 
i mean it seems like th- 
oh so what would be the your favorite meal to cook 
none to cook 
i do n't like to cook 
do n't like to cook huh 
spaghetti i guess though 
i make a mean spaghetti 
make a mean spaghetti huh 
yeah 
uh got kids 
no 
m- married 
huh-uh 
just my husband and i and the two dogs 
yeah 
so what about yours 
well uh my wife and i 
we 've got a thirteen week old baby 
so do n't do much cooking for him yet 
uh-huh 
uh 
hm so i guess it 's supposed to be dinner party 
is that what they said 
uh uh yeah 
what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party 
and uh what kind of dishes you might have for it or some sort of thing like that 
uh-huh 
huh 
we do n't 
let 's see 
a good dinner party menu 
thank you 
i suppose it would just about depend on who was coming i guess 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i do n't know uh something light and easy 
if it was pretty in- informal about anything 
um-hum 
well sometimes we 'll have uh we 'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer 
roast chicken 
oh gosh 
yeah 
how do you usually cook your deer 
huh 
how do you usually cook your deer 
how do we usually 
yeah 
on the grill 
we 'll take the back strap and soak it in italian dressing for a couple of hours and throw it on the grill 
yeah 
and it is good 
i imagine 
real good 
i would imagine it is 
either that or hamburgers 
we really do n't have dinner parties 
yeah 
yeah 
i understand 
um-hum ooh 
we just had uh deer stew sort of uh d- deer steak stew 
uh-huh 
um what was it about a day day and a half in the crock pot um uh some deer steaks in kind of a mushroom gravy um some veggies and a 
ooh 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
did you kill the deer 
delicious 
no 
no 
no 
the times i 've been out deer hunting i- 
i- i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa 
uh-huh 
i mean i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon 
and suddenly there is n't a deer within fifty miles 
so no 
th- this was given to us by some friends 
uh-huh 
um guy was in a uh in a hunting club and you know 
um-hum 
but the whole group goes out hunting 
and then at the end of the day they split it and whoever brought it down gets the lion 's share 
um-hum 
and the rest of it 's split with the rest with everybody in the group 
oh well that 's nice 
well he wou- 
they they went out last year 
and almost everybody got it the limit so there 's everybody had deer coming out their ears 
uh-huh 
so 
yeah 
we still got some from last year 
yeah 
th- they gave us some deer 
and some of it 's still in the freezer 
and they was about eight months ago they gave it to us 
yeah 
no we we either crock pot deer 
or we 'll uh you know put it out on the grill so that so that the bulk of the uh tallow will dribble off of it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
we h- we usually have most of it made into uh hamburger meat though and cook you know spaghetti with it 
yeah 
yeah 
chili 
that is good 
so 
deer spaghetti is real good 
um-hum 
anyway um no 
i think if i was going to have a dinner party i 'd probably have uh sandwiches or something along those lines and then uh um you know just something light finger food sort of something or or maybe have something roasting out on a fire 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
oh well anyway um we do n't do much in the way of entertaining 
a hum 
but usually it 's one other couple come over for a dinner 
um-hum 
let 's see 
what did we have the last time we had guests over 
ah yeah we had a uh a turkey loaf 
oh 
was kind of taco turkey loaf 
uh it was good 
uh scalloped potatoes 
ooh 
and no 
it was mashed potatoes 
um-hum 
mashed potatoes with uh m- cheese melted over the top of them 
hm 
a couple things like that 
it was pretty good little dinner 
hm sounds good 
yeah 
usually the kind 
this is n't a good topic for me right now 
i 'm on a diet 
oh do n't you hate that 
yeah i 've got a i got a a few pounds to lose myself 
that 's okay 
i 've been fighting my weight since i was about ten years old 
yeah 
i have too 
i was real skinny till i was ten 
yeah 
yeah 
i w- was a left fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh gr- grade at two 
uh did you watch the bulls this morning 
you know what 
i watched a little bit of uh of the bulls game 
and i uh had to leave 
um in fact i- i think the bulls were ahead when i uh when i left 
who won the game 
they won in a squeaker 
they won by they won by two points 
is that right 
uh they were behind as they headed into each quarter 
and then they came back in the second half 
and at the end i think they were uh looked they looked like they were closing it out 
and then detroit kept coming back 
and uh isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end 
uh-huh 
and uh i think the bulls won by two 
wow they 've got the do n't they have the best record now 
i think they do as a matter of fact 
yeah 
one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace uh set an nba record for seventy wins in a season 
wow 
yeah 
they looked real good 
and 
they they do 
and they uh you know 
i think by uh by relieving some of the pressure off of uh of uh uh 
michael jordan really helped them out 
you know he does n't have they do n't have to rely on him to score ev- you know thirty or forty points at every at every game 
right 
so 
yeah 
well they they 're they 're balancing their attack 
and i think they look like uh they 'll repeat although uh here in the bay area people are real impressed with what don nelson 's done with the warriors 
oh i know 
i 'm 
yeah 
i saw the w- i saw the warriors uh just a little bit of the highlights of the warriors uh dallas game 
i saw the the second half of the game last night 
and they were impressive 
they look good 
billy owens looks like he was 
that was a good move for the warriors to trade for him 
yeah 
now i do n't uh i have n't kept up with what was going on with uh with the 
well they traded away uh mitch richmond 
or is it tim hardaway 
one of the two uh who along with uh chris mullin was you know 
though three were three of the best in the nba 
and and they made a heck of a threesome 
w- uh-huh 
and they traded either richmond or hardaway to sacramento for billy owens 
and uh 
good move 
yeah 
oh yeah 
he 's really worked out well 
they 've got the the warriors have got a team uh 
and uh i think that 'll be real interesting to see what they can do 
they 're ahead 
and the lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west 
and i do n't know 
yeah 
in the east i do n't know uh 
is it boston in uh first place 
uh i think boston 's in first 
um i you know i have n't kept up with any of the other uh teams 
uh i 'm so depressed with the dallas mavericks you know 
boy 
they 've had a hard time 
they said they 've lost a lot of squeakers 
oh man 
that 
well yeah 
but i mean just this whole year has been just disastrous for them 
and uh you know they 're going i- i think they 're going for an all time record of how many l- you know losses in a row they can they c- they can uh pull out 
yeah 
it 's unbelievable 
how do people in texas deal with dallas houston and san antonio 
do you for example like san antonio uh in dallas 
uh 
actually actually the the the dallas area here uh pulls for dallas 
uh san antonio pulls for san antonio 
and houston pulls for for the rockets 
so there is n't much crossover huh 
y- 
they 're really 
i mean not a whole lot you know 
i mean you find them they 're find them be to be pretty loyal uh you know w- with the local teams 
yeah 
um you know it 's kind of i guess it 's kind of like uh there in the bay area you know you do n't find a whole lot of uh uh of sacramento fans 
yeah 
it 's true 
because s- san antonio is n't that close to you are they 
really is n't 
huh-uh 
no 
it 's you know it 's it 's about the same uh same distance from here to s- to san antonio as it is from there to sacramento 
is it 
yeah 
so it 's not something you 'd drive 
so it 's yeah it 's not really a local you know 
yeah 
i was thinking maybe david robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing 
um he does a lot of local stuff there in san antonio 
and they i mean they have got a great club you know 
they 've done a good job 
i mean of course drafting a franchise like him certainly 
uh yeah 
yeah 
that always makes a big difference 
yeah 
i mean that 's i think the way it uh i think that 's the way it works now in basketball 
so 
you you know magic was a franchise for the lakers and you know uh bird for the for the uh celtics 
yeah 
and 
and you know uh you know i used to think that that one one player really does n't make the club 
but it really does you know 
well it 
you get somebody like magic 
and you can see the decline of that team 
it 's steve well yeah 
once he left you know i mean it 's it 's just not the same uh it 's not the same team 
there 's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for 
i well i think you 're right 
and i think isaiah thomas would fit in detroit 
and i think those things do make a difference 
and there are marquee players 
and i think i think jordan and the and the bulls have to be uh considered the likely favorites 
oh yeah 
i do n't know who would meet them in the west 
um i do n't know how good portland will turn out to be by the end of the year 
they were so disappointing 
who won that portland game 
you know i was n't i- i d- i watched only a few minutes of it 
and i was n't paying attention 
uh so i do n't know uh 
uh 
but phoenix you know phoenix and portland have both been very good clubs 
and 
i guess we 're ready to talk 
how you doing howard 
this is a a subject that i 'm not real well versed on 
but 
well let 's talk about air pollution 
okay 
what do you think causes air pollution in dallas 
or where are you from 
no 
maybe you 're not in dallas 
okay 
i 'm from the uh i 'm from dallas 
i 'm in richardson 
okay 
uh 
what do you think as far as air pollution in the dallas area 
well i have some small experience in this area 
the brown haze that you see if you look down central towards downtown a lot of that is uh tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish-gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates 
right 
but uh the one of the major problems that dallas has i- is oxides and nitrogen 
that 's because of all the equipment that 's being operated 
but at the same time uh because we do n't have we do n't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we do n't get a lot of particulates 
now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in dallas 
right 
uh power plants since many of our local power plants uh are natural gas most of the time uh the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide and nox 
there 's no particulates in natural gas of course 
and we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products 
we 're burning fuel oil and a few other things 
but gasoline of course now that lead 's out at least theoretically uh 
uh i guess you could say we 're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur 
that 's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter there 's a little sulphur 
oh really 
yes 
and that 's uh course hydrogen sulfide which is 
when you burn gasoline you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur 
sure 
and you under the right condition you get h2s 
but anyway uh 
well you are you are well versed on the subject i tell you 
well i do n't know 
this is not one of my better ones 
i guess i guess i notice it the most just uh in driving around dallas with all the the highway equipment that 's working on the on six thirty five and seventy five just with the cars in general 
but um-hum 
that 's where i see most of it 
ro- uh ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because of the way the pollution is 
right 
and when they run rich they they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons 
and that 's another part of the problem 
the gas is not being burned completely 
but um i- hopefully if we ever get our road system fixed up this will get a lot better 
oh i do n't know 
i 've lived here since seventy four howard 
and i d- i think i think they been working on the highways around here since i 've been here 
and i think they 'll i think they 'll be working on them long after my wife and i are gone 
well i- i guess 
i not trying to top you 
but i grew up in dallas county 
and i can remember when they built the north part of north central which was built after the south part of of central 
h- right 
and uh i can remember coming over the hill down there long about um i do n't know little bit north of mock- mockingbird on up in over those hills 
and i said i wonder if they 'll ever need this road 
course it was designed for most of us to go about forty five miles an hour because the short on ramps and off off ramps 
but gosh seems like uh those ramps might kill us yet 
i 
hopefully the new ones will be a lot better 
i understand 
i sure hope so 
i tell you 
you know you get out on the uh interstate highways versus 
i travel quite a bit 
and traveling from like dallas to austin to san antonio it 's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles in the in the stalled traffic 
and the busy highways you know you 're at your best 
and i guess when you 're out on the interstate heading north or south and you 're just cruising right along and there 's no build up of cars and 
um-hum yeah 
ron have you noticed when you 're driving south on thirty five i guess towards waxahachie hillsborough on down to austin you hit a point down there about i think where they call bear creek exit right just this side of the county line right along in there somewhere suddenly the air feels cleaner 
yes 
have you noticed that 
i tell you what 
i- i do n't think i really have 
but i 'm going that way tuesday 
and i 'm going to make it a point to 
well sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing but uh i also travel a little bit 
sure 
and uh i do n't know 
it just seems like there 's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier 
it may be all in my mind 
oh i know 
i know going to uh uh 
i detest going to houston because it 's such a l- 
well michael what do you think about um funding for aids research 
do you 
well um uh that 's something i 've never thought a lot about 
oops um-hum 
um i 've i work in a hospital 
uh-huh 
and i 've worked in the hospital for about fifteen years 
and i 've taken care of a few aids patients 
uh-huh 
um when they asked us did did we want to um keep it the same or uh spend more or spend less i think uh i think right now w- what they 're spending is adequate uh my for my personal opinion um because i think it 's something that 's going to take them a while to come up with a uh vaccine for 
yeah 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
i do n't think it 's going to be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know 
yeah 
uh-huh 
and um so i do n't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now 
i think they 're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know 
uh-huh 
and uh what about you 
well i guess i 'm not too aware of how much they 're spending right now 
i 'm not either 
you know 
i 'm definitely not aware of how much 
yeah 
uh it 's something i 've never really kept up with at all 
uh-huh 
yeah 
um i do n't kn- i 'm not sure uh 
i mean i 
go ahead 
i know uh i 've always thought more about the disease rather than the research 
you know what i mean 
um-hum uh-huh 
yeah 
and uh that sort of thing 
um if if we were talking about the money um i 'd just have to say what they 're spending is probably enough simply because i do n't know that much about it you know 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean i- i can see that research is needed 
and you know 
oh yeah 
definitely 
i think so 
i think so 
i mean it 's becoming a major problem 
yeah 
but uh i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them focus on uh preventing it uh in more you know 
yeah 
yeah 
well that 's true 
that 's true because um it 's a such an easily preventable disease 
right 
and i- i feel like just saying uh safe sex is not the answer 
um 
it 's it 's uh abstinence in certain cases 
no 
it 's definitely not 
and 
that 's true 
that 's true 
yeah 
um 
and knowing you know 
myself um um i 'm just recently or about to get a divorce and uh course i 'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything 
uh-huh 
yeah 
but it 's sort of scary to find yourself single again you know 
um-hum 
and um because you never know what 's going to happen 
you do n't know who you 're going to come across you know 
yeah 
course it 's it 's not that i 'm wanting to i 'm not going to wanting to go and have sex with everybody i see 
uh-huh 
but it 's something you got to think about these days 
yeah 
a single person you know 
um-hum 
and um i mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry 
yeah 
yeah 
and um 
i think for a lot of people it has 
certainly 
so 
yeah 
so 
but um uh i know that uh in some of these larger cities they 're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts wo n't be getting dirty needles and everything 
uh-huh 
drug addicts 
um-hum 
yeah 
and uh i do n't know 
i do n't think that 's a bad idea 
uh-huh 
i know it uh sort of does n't address the problem of drug addiction 
yeah 
it just sort of keeps that going 
yeah 
but um i do n't know 
at least drug addiction can be treated whereas aids so far can not be you know 
uh-huh 
so i do n't know 
that i think that 's 
i 'm not t- too much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself 
um-hum 
i do n't know 
what do you think about that 
well yeah 
boy th- that 's a hard issue 
it 's it really is 
it really is 
it really is 
they gave us a hard topic 
yeah 
i mean i- i definitely think that it 's the drug problem that needs to be addressed 
but as you say um people i mean in the meantime 
well someone who 's not ready to give up drugs um you know 
um-hum 
that 's true 
that 's true 
if they 're per- perpetrating the aids problem passing that on to each other then you know 
yeah 
you know i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction an aids aids would have to have come first i guess as far as something to uh to do about it 
yeah 
yeah 
uh-huh 
so so i do n't know 
um course there 's so many things in the world where if you solve one problem you may be creating another you know 
yeah 
and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse and which is the most important to solve at the time 
yeah 
and 
uh-huh 
i do n't know 
yeah 
but um but i 've never looked into how much money they 're spending 
i have i have no idea 
um-hum 
and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that 
yeah 
but uh i really have never looked into it 
i have no idea 
yeah 
i have n't either 
i 've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying we 're not spending enough 
um yeah 
yeah 
and mostly that 's what i 've heard 
right 
sure 
so i do n't know 
yeah 
and yet i know it 's um it sounds like big money to me 
yeah i think it is 
but it probably takes a lot 
i think it is 
yeah 
it does every 
so 
it seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do 
it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would you know 
um-hum 
yeah 
but uh 
did you have any fear working in the hospital with that 
uh that 's one thing i 've never really feared 
uh-huh 
um uh i 
a lot of the my family you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions 
but um uh i do n't fear it at all 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
um i work in in the operating room a lot and um and of course when we 
um-hum 
well got any problems on mockingbird with crime 
or is that a crime free zone you 're in 
no 
i do n't think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer 
i 'm afraid you 're right 
uh uh one evening i decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought oh well something 's happens on mockingbird and then heard yells and screams 
and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house 
oh my 
and they had stopped a uh a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge 
oh boy 
and then the other one was on the roof in the back 
by your house 
b- on my house 
oh my goodness 
ah aye aye 
so i 'm very much aware of uh crime in the cities and the and the concern about it 
oh my 
that 's that 's got to be a frightening way to s- spend an evening 
it was 
i uh i kept hearing noises 
and so i i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage 
so i got a g- my gun and walked to the you know through the house into the garage 
there was no one there 
but i wanted to be sure 
oh boy 
is plano beginning to experience the the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan you know in the urban area 
unfortunately yes 
that 's too bad 
yes 
i think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get the hoods and the riffraff riffraff and everybody else in there 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and i think 
uh you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on spring creek 
but uh we 've been we 've lived here sixteen years 
and now you you know you -an tell the change for sure 
um-hum 
well i was thinking if you 've been there that long you 've seen plano grow from what was really a a small town to a city 
yes 
well with all the uh central expressway uh with all the stores and the uh restaurants and the uh convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it 's just prime pickings for people driving by 
um-hum 
yeah 
you know and 
well i was appalled to read the other day about the uh uh shooting on the tollway 
that 's that could n't be too far from you neither 
uh well it 's further west of me 
uh okay 
i live over near white rock lake 
oh yes 
okay 
but uh 
uh it was really frightening to think that uh it 's not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth 
uh i never thought about someone robbing those 
but apparently they do 
i do n't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody 
but 
yeah 
it just does n't seem possible does it 
it 's kind of kind of stupid is n't it 
um-hum 
but i guess when people do those things they do n't really give a thought of the consequences at the time 
it 's looks like easy pickings 
no 
and away you go right 
yeah 
and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in um the theft and the the violence that we see 
i think you 're right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too 
it it is convenient is n't it 
right 
i did n't know what i was doing 
right 
that kind 
right 
just like the old alcohol idea 
and i think people uh i think when you have haves and have nots you 're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it 's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money 
of um-hum 
um-hum 
well yes 
and i work in south dallas for the dallas school system 
oh boy 
and uh uh 
where do you work 
uh do you know where oakland and hatcher are 
uh yes 
i think i do 
that uh is that amelia earhart -hart school there 
uh no 
this is over near lincoln high school uh just not far off south central expressway 
okay 
that 's a pretty rough area there is n't it 
it is a pretty rough area 
we 're over by fair park 
um my goodness 
and uh you know you watch the people 
there are marvelous bmw 's and mercedes and cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns 
huh 
and the kids see that 
and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where uh you know running for uh drug dealers if 
definitely that area that that 's big time 
um-hum 
big time there sure is 
it surely is 
i do n't think i 'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself 
well i 'm careful 
in that area gee 
that 's the worst neighborhood in the whole c- area 
yeah 
it 's uh a little scary sometimes 
and uh i manage the 
mike i 'm calling from dallas from richardson 
oh okay great 
i 'm in addison here 
okay 
well good 
you know our subject is on boating and sailing and quite honestly with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat i have never really got into sailing or boating 
right 
i do uh quite a bit of sailing 
i own a sailboat that i keep parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop 
oh do you 
well great 
and we take it out 
and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts 
but i have n't really been taking it out recreationally too much lately 
well that 's neat 
since it 's i do n't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore 
right 
so it 's hard for me to get it somewhere 
but 
i 've seen some nice nice sailboats 
the guy that used to live next to us in richardson before we moved twelve years ago or whatever he had a sailboat used to park it right in the uh driveway 
and it seemed 
i think it held probably uh 
it must have slept four people anyway 
yeah 
this one is not that big 
it 's a day sailer 
it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you could n't really sleep in there unless you sort of stuck your body out the whole it back into the main part of the sailboat 
right 
i i understand 
but but it 's there they can be black holes to throw money into 
i 'll tell you 
boats are kind of expensive to maintain 
it 's oh they are 
and you know we have a swimming pool at our house 
and i think of all the time now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever that i put in there 
i just could not imagine a boat because i know it 's a lot of maintenance 
especially a bigger one 
oh gosh yeah 
the bigger they are if you get a big cabin cruiser or a big ski boat power boat then there 's always uh stuff to go wrong with it 
you bet 
the sailboat at least does n't have an engine to mess up 
but you still have to worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging uh everything that 's in it 
sure 
it takes a a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up 
but 
you bet 
i know 
my wife and i were first married her 
aunt and uncle un- aunt and uncle up in new york they kept a boat on jamaica bay 
and we used to go out with them 
and back then they had bought an older chris craft 
and we were involved every weekend in just uh as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping him redo this and refinish that 
we just worked all the time 
but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen 
it was sort of neat 
we but i think that was the last time we were really involved 
in that was twenty years ago or twenty five years ago 
well it 's a lot of fun i think um just from the standpoint of getting away from the dodge here 
it is a lot of fun 
and when you work hard and you 're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation uh to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it 
you bet 
an- but it 's uh 
i visited my cousin a couple of years ago my wife and i and our daughter 
and he had a place on the lake of the ozarks 
and he had a boat 
and uh i never seen so many boats in all my life 
people actually park their car when they get to their place they 're staying an- townhouse or condominium whatever they own 
and they they go boats 
use the boat for transportation 
i mean they go 
if they want to go to a lounge to have a cocktail they use the boat 
they just go across the boat and get a an- tie it up and go in huh 
and that was sort of neat 
yeah th- that 's that 's true 
that 's exactly how they do it 
they go to dinner that way go to all the restaurants 
that was sort of a neat setup 
i enjoyed that 
we spent a week with them 
i enjoyed that 
but i 'm envious i 'm envious of people that have the big boats and uh 
yeah that would be fun 
i 've just never i 've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat 
um once i get my son into and through with college 
he 's going to be starting uh rice next year 
so he 's going off 
but um once i get to that stage where i 'm not paying for something else and uh i- i do n't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where i 've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it uh i might do something differently 
you bet 
i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them keep it and maybe consider getting a a better one for me 
uh 
thi- you think you 'd really enjoy it 
yeah 
i think i would 
uh i the sailing part of it i like uh because it 's so quiet 
yes 
and if you get a big enough one then you 've got a little motor on it also where if it 's light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun 
oh that 's 
or if or if the wind dies you 're not stuck in the middle of the lake 
i 've with my little one i 've been out there many times on a calm summer day where all of a sudden the wind stops 
yeah 
that 's great 
and you 're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in 
and and that gets hot and and wearisome doing that 
oh i know 
and if you ha- if you 're ha- big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in 
and putt putt 
sure 
well that 's neat 
but it 's fun 
where do you work 
who are you with 
i own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance uh out in addison 
well good 
and uh i 'm a scout leader though 
so i 'm i 'm out wi- 
hi 
what do you think about gun control 
well uh sort of mixed feelings about it i guess uh uh 
i i s- i lean more towards the control side than than towards you know just the the free free arming 
um on the other hand i it 's it 's sort of an issue of of uh 
uh i 'm not i 'm not a great fan of of government control in general 
and so it 's it 's kind of a tough issue 
what about yourself 
well i guess that i would like to to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or um have a legitimate use for the the the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the the problems in dc come home very quickly 
um-hum 
i 'm i 'm sure 
yeah 
um so you would take a position where somebody without without a uh um specific use 
in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home uh you would n't you would n't like them to be able to do that 
is that 
well i 'm not so sure about that 
but i think somehow uh safety courses 
or i do n't know whether this could be something that was done in school 
but somehow people 
i 'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were whether they followed them or not 
you know at least there 's the moral issue that they they knew better which is sort of you know flaky 
huh 
but still 
yeah 
i i have i- i have the impression that that the the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not a- are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway 
um that may be wrong 
um you know i mean certainly there there are cases of of you know the children who find their parents gun or something and and shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided 
and that 's that 's certainly within the channels 
right 
um-hum 
but um a lot of the the crime i think that goes on i i do n't know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or they 're illegal guns 
yeah 
i do n't know 
this morning in our paper it there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in virginia because all you have to do is get a driver 's license 
so he went over there and got a driver 's license the same day bought three guns and went up to new york and sold them for you know very high markups 
now in a sense that 's a legal way of getting the guns 
uh-huh 
but certainly the the purpose is not very legal 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i i mean i think uh some sta- 
or i i i do n't know if anybody actually has implemented 
i think so um 
at least there 's been talk about doing uh you know like waiting periods and and things like that 
um-hum 
um and and uh you know i i think stuff like that is perfectly good 
i mean basically if you if you do n't intend to do anything stra- you know if you if you 're buying it for legitimate purposes waiting ten days should n't be a problem you know and and things 
right 
i do n't know 
i 've you know 
i uh i do n't own a gun and and do n't really want one 
and i 'd just as soon a lot fewer people did 
um-hum 
um but on the other hand you know uh like i say i kind of kind of against government control in general 
uh 
right 
and i suppose com- uh you know c- total ban would lead to more illegal weapons 
yeah 
and i you know 
something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that it they 're not going to disappear anytime soon 
um and they 're already 
i know there 's a ready market for them you know in the s- 
the stolen stolen guns can be sold 
i mean their first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun 
um-hum 
um-hum 
right 
because uh because they they can be so easily sold 
and you know their their 
i do n't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country 
but um it 's not like they 're going to disappear all of a sudden um even if you do do a total ban on them 
uh-huh it 's a real tough problem 
right 
i i do n't know 
i do n't know where i really come down on it 
i mean i i grew up 
my father was a hunter 
right 
and that 's and that 's sort of almost a separate issue 
i think we 've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing right 
um-hum 
you know and 
but that 's true 
i mean some people grew up with guns in the house 
we never had any in the house so to me the you know the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing 
uh-huh 
hm yeah 
and i 'm not sure that 's good either 
well we you know we i grew up with them 
i never really took to hunting 
i mean i did some of it 
but uh you know we did n't have any we never had any handguns or anything like that 
we had you know had shotguns for for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that 
um-hum 
and you know it was a whole different thing 
and and gun safety was taken very seriously 
and it was you know 
i mean before we go hunting we we took safety courses 
but it you know that 's that seems to me just to be a whole another issue 
um-hum 
um you know the the thing 
that the i 
yeah 
i 'm not certain that people are are are terribly concerned about other people 
okay 
cindy you there 
yeah 
okay 
what kind of dinner parties have you had 
yeah well i 've had them uh where i 've served up to twelve to sixteen people 
um-hum 
um and i had help with them 
um and part of them i did were like a buffet and uh it 
uh-huh 
i had uh just different uh side dishes and appetizers 
and one of them that that i 'd remembered was uh some uh sausage hors doeuvres 
and uh anyhow uh you take uh a couple of uh cups of bisquick and uh sausage oh like a a owens mild 
uh-huh 
you can i guess you could use the hot if you wanted to 
whatever you like huh 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh you put that in 
and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and m- make it all doughy 
um-hum 
and then like i just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes and they are so good 
hm 
oh that sounds delicious 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's making me hungry for them right now 
yeah 
you know i 've made like little swedish meatballs 
but they 're just made out of the beef you know and uh with spices and things in them but never anything mixed with bisquick 
have you 
yeah 
uh-huh 
i i 've used that quite a bit 
and it and it seems to work real well 
um-hum 
um 
hm 
and uh um when i 've had so many people uh t- to feed like i 'd try to do a ham an a turkey 
and and 
yeah 
that 's my that 's my parties mostly is at christmas time and thanksgiving time 
yeah 
you know i 've uh i had an open house party here once when after we moved in here uh which i had uh things like that 
but i always cooked them ahead of time 
and then i just sliced them you know and had macaroni salad with uh shrimp in it 
um-hum 
have you ever had that 
no 
what 
get some fresh little fresh shrimp 
and it 's in your macaroni salad that you make 
uh-huh 
the shrimp just gives it a really good flavor 
oh i 'll bet 
yeah 
i do n't like the can but the fresh 
yeah 
you know 
i 'll have to try that 
yeah 
that was really good 
i like things that are easy and and uh nutritious 
yeah 
right 
right 
but uh at uh christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner you know which is kind of hard because you got so many people 
uh-huh 
and then by time you pass everything around 
it seems like everything on your plate 's cold 
i know 
i know 
so 
well 
but anyhow i 
thank god for microwaves you know 
yeah 
you can always take your plate and just heat it up you know 
yeah 
but uh other than that i- i do n't have t- too many parties 
uh you know i have like maybe just a cou- another couple over for dinner 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but uh other than than than that i do n't have you know a whole bunch of people like except except at christmas 
yeah 
and i have my family 
right 
well i do n't anymore 
yeah it 's been a few years 
and and uh i do n't have you know over a couple either 
and and uh i try to uh have everything all ready 
um-hum 
and and it it just makes it a lot nicer where i do n't s- spend all my time in the kitchen 
yeah 
right 
and uh spaghetti 
right 
and 
yeah 
that 's easy 
i always like to have that too 
you 
yeah 
know everybody seems to like that too 
i know 
i do n't think i 've ever met anyone that did n't 
no 
everybody likes that 
yeah 
and then uh if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there you know especially if a pork roast 
oh yeah 
that 's what i love with my 
i like it too 
i do too 
and um other than that in fact i 'm just thinking of what g- next weekend when the super bowl 's on i 've asked a couple people to come over 
um-hum 
and i just uh had been thinking what to have for that 
yeah 
well have you had any good ideas yet 
no not yet 
oh okay 
no 
and i you know i do n't want to have to come away from the tv 
i want something that i can just take them and serve them while they 're sitting in front of the tv 
yeah 
you know so i 'll think of something just th- that we can munch on over there you know 
yeah 
and they can just f- fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down 
and that 's the way to do it too 
yeah 
yeah 
i think it 's you know what 's i think is so nice is that in this day and time that we can have good food that 's good for you 
and you do n't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen 
yeah 
and and it makes an awful lot of difference does n't it 
preparing it 
right 
oh it sure does 
well 
well when i was brought up you know we did n't 
um go ahead 
tell me what you think 
do we get our money 's worth 
hey listen if i had my way i would n't pay my taxes 
not with the not with some of the things that i hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things 
yeah 
did you see sixty minutes last night 
no 
i did not 
i 
well they did a thing on the the thirty five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we do n't need 
and uh it 's staggering 
was well how does this grab you how does this grab you 
um this 
i- i mean i 'm i 'm a lady 
but this i heard this on a christian program 
and it was uh about the nea 
and that 's the national endowment for arts 
and they fund they funded this thing this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money 
well there are a lot of things that people i think generally 
and then it just frosts me terribly 
well i think it 's interesting to look at um where the money goes 
and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go 
and and i do n't think generally i think what 's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government 
absolutely 
and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with 
i believe that 's true 
yes 
and that what i think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it 
i mean we are going to have to change the people who represent us 
that 's correct 
i mean and i think it 's going to be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh 
heavy involvement from the public 
yeah 
right that 's y- i think that 's the only thing that 's going to change it 
um-hum 
yeah 
heavy involvement from the public 
a- o- our anger is going to have to to give rise to to more activity on our part 
yeah 
um i 've i 've said for years that there 's full employment for the politically active 
and in our society uh there 's very little full employment 
most people in this country are getting worse off not better off 
absolutely 
eighty percent of the public according to bill moyer 's uh 
recent uh 
piece for uh 
public broadcasting which by the way is a very good use of government money i think pbs is wonderful 
but this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes 
and thus standards of living decline 
and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve 
that 's not a formula for a better society 
no 
it is not 
it 's lopsided very much 
so 
and the government really plays a role in this 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
they pull the strings 
i mean w- well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful inter- 
right 
the 
yeah 
you know and it 's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting 
but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others do n't 
and they think it 's unfair 
and when they recognize it 's their tax money they 're going to do more about it 
i th- i 'll tell you one quick uh one thing very interesting 
cbs after the state of the union address is going to open up a telephone line an eight hundred number 
and people can call in and say what they think about what 's going on in this country 
um-hum 
they expect opening it for one hour that they 'll get three hundred thousand telephone calls 
i 'm sure they will 
and i 've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to p- create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
i think that 's coming 
and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change 
until then i think you know it 's going to be really painful 
so the question is how soon are we going to start to get our money 's worth 
and as you said it 's how soon we get involved 
and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look do it this way not that way or i like this or i do n't like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i do n't think is art 
yes 
i understand that 
but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it 
well that 's the good thing about what is happening because i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it is telling us m- you know about the problems 
so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we 've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country 
oh absolutely 
over a very long period of time 
right 
absolutely 
um and uh 
we only see the tip of the iceberg it 's only 
right 
you know there 's so much of it going on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture 
yeah 
well you may be right 
what i think is really going to be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it 
and i and i think it is what you say it 's it 's a 
okay 
you 're probably uh more up on this subject than i am 
but the roles that women have played the last coup- couple of year in our are couple of generations 
that 
right 
well they 've entered the work force more uh you know since world war two is when they started 
you bet 
and uh i think that that is you know very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women 
you bet 
you know where i 've noticed it more i think is 
i 'm a traveling salesperson 
and i have traveled most of my life 
and i know just especially in the last oh ten years and really since 
the in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling 
right 
you know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers 
i sell sporting goods 
and even in our industry uh there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell 
and even in the last f- five or six years boy you see more and more women being involved 
and you know it 's a it 's a credit to them as far as how they 're doing things 
yeah 
the 
you see more of that you see more of them uh leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too 
you bet 
you know i- i go to a i have a club that i belong to altrusa that 
you know one of the girls travels quite extensively 
and she said well my children have two parents 
you know why not 
you bet 
that 's sort of neat 
so that that 's a i think that 's a change 
and i think that 's a change you 're going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father 's going to take more active role in child rearing 
sure 
i think uh it 's the a- age old thing 
every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you 'll see it on tv or something where the discussion comes out that you know women are paid less than men 
and they 're and they 're doing the same uh or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i that 's a very true statement 
right 
and it should n't uh it should n't be that way and 
no 
that that i think should change will change in the near future also 
i think so hope so 
an- 
it 's been changing 
it 's been evolving 
but there 's still a an an inequality in the work force in certain jobs 
abs- 
it 's you know 
you know i 've 
and you hear some people say you know 
well he 's a man 
he he he needs that salary 
right 
yeah 
they forget 
also i think uh a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know 
if if a 
a woman congressman i 'm sure makes as much as a man congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever 
right 
so they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way 
but i guess just the most significant th- change for me again as i mentioned it was just in traveling 
you see uh more and more ladies all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going 
and going 
yeah 
um-hum 
and i expect you 're right in regards to having two parents now 
that 's a good a good statement 
and i think if 
in the future it 's even going to be uh more noticeable and more significant 
right 
yeah 
i- i think it will be 
i think i well 
an- another thing i read too the other day 
this is not just for working women 
but how much they 're out there i guess is 
that car designers um are starting to design cars with women in mind um because in the past the male bought the cars 
but now they 're showing that fifty five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases and that they are looking for um different things in the car 
wow 
the man is looking for the e- in the engine 
and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel uh can her makeup come off the upholstery 
you bet 
good point 
and if they 're out there buying that many cars then there 's that many out there that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working 
right now i 'm self employed 
and and my wife 's always worked 
she 's a schoolteacher 
but for 
she started working 
and then when i first started my business uh 
she was selling real estate at the time 
and hers was the only income we had for three or four months 
so 
right 
you know she certainly did her part in help getting me established in my business 
and she still works everyday 
so 
yeah 
we all do 
you bet 
i 'm just happen to be off today 
uh-oh 
so i work too 
enj- enjoying it 
what kind of work do you do 
i 'm a nurse 
well good 
and i work at medical treatment center um which is at garl- uh jupiter and arapaho 
right 
married 
no 
yeah 
w- well trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject 
i do n't know 
i 'm kind of out of out of things 
you see the old uh cigarette ads you know about you 've come a long way 
you 've come a long way baby 
baby 
right 
and uh 
right 
you think about this when you coming to a when it comes to a subject like that 
and it 's really true 
women have come a long way 
and you know 
why do n't you tell me about your choir 
oh 
okay 
well we uh are a group of uh musicians that just kind of have you know formed out of a desire to sing 
and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say 
um-hum 
lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh 
others have 
there 's one gal that 's in the uh plano community orchestra uh 
just you know different backgrounds 
it 's been really kind of interesting 
great 
so 
um i play the piano and uh i have a four year old who who has started to play the piano 
um 
he does that uh musically listens 
and then he can play which is kind of interesting 
oh yeah 
i think it 's because he 's always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby 
um-hum 
uh my husband and my other son who 's eleven just got through singing in a musical here in in the community at music man 
oh they did 
yeah 
and it was lots of fun 
how did how did they get involved in that 
um basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions 
it was the plano repertory theatre 
um-hum 
and so they went and tried out 
and my husband played harold hill from the music man 
and my son played one of the children in a band 
oh how fun 
so yeah 
it was really fun 
and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school 
and my daughter takes piano lessons too 
yeah um-hum 
but uh we just really like music 
it 's a i- i especially like it as an outlet when the tv goes off 
we get the tv off and and just have some nice quiet music 
um-hum um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's nice 
you say have your four year old taking lessons already 
um-hum 
and uh who do you have her or him take it from 
um i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches suzuki which is an auditory type learning experience 
uh-huh 
you listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear- by hearing the intervals and things like that 
um-hum 
i teach uh like what is traditionally taught you know 
you look at the note on the page 
and you play what 's on the piano 
but he can n't learn like that 
he 's a delayed child 
he 's only about i guess he 's about two and a half in his real understanding of things 
oh 
and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it uh with his right hand 
we went wow we better have him do s- do something you know educationally 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
so that was really fun 
well because my 
my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown though 
pardon me 
so my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into dallas 
um-hum 
um-hum 
well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who 's taken piano lessons since the started out at the age of just turning five because she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much 
um 
and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play 
and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally 
she just 
oh i think that 's great 
so i was n't sure when to start her 
i did n't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene 
that 's really hard i think because especially if you start them 
and then they get pretty good 
and then they get close ten you know eleven or something 
and they go i do n't want to do this anymore 
and you 're like g- i really want you to do it 
um-hum 
yeah 
you know 
yeah 
so sometimes it 's hard to to know exactly when 
but i do n't know 
if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
i think she 'd like to 
i just do n't know if it 's really 
knowing from what my daughter has gone through she 's she learned a lot 
and it course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it 
uh-huh 
it was something easily forgotten 
so um i do n't know if she 's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight 
or or should i say seven 
i mean she 's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she 's going to excel just naturally 
she does have to really work at it 
but um so 
that 's like me 
yeah 
uh so i 'm kind of you know just playing with it 
but at this point we 're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway 
but 
well it can get expensive that 's for sure 
yeah 
yeah 
i my friend is is very generous in in letting us have my children uh do the suzuki method without paying a lot out 
um-hum 
oh that 's good 
yeah 
so it 's been good for our family 
well as a piano teacher do you have any feelings from kids who come from a suzuki method 
have you had any former suzuki students 
i do n't have any suzuki students um 
i was wondering how th- 
something happening to me at christmas time that that verified to me that i will al- 
so you have a child two years old in child care right now 
yeah 
we 
have a two year old daughter in child care 
and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh pretty reasonable price we think 
um-hum 
uh 
how about you 
do you have any children 
yes 
our first 
and he just turned three months 
oh boy 
so we 're just starting into hunting for child care 
yeah 
right now both of us are students 
are you 
where are you student 
uh 
uh university of southern mississippi 
no kidding 
um she 's 
i was a professor in a university here in california for a while 
yeah 
yeah 
uh are you going to uh put your son in child care in a a year or two 
uh probably um 
actually spring semester a year from now he 's going to have to be in child care fo- uh five days a week more than likely uh depending on how my class schedule runs 
yeah 
because my wife will be doing her internship that semester 
yeah uh-huh 
it 'll be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing 
yeah 
so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four si- anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care by that point 
right now we 're trying to avoid it 
but we just a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him 
uh i get out of class at certain time 
and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class y- know 
once a day this overlap happens where we can n't one of us be home 
yeah 
yeah 
so for about twenty min- twenty thirty minutes a day we got a babysitter comes in 
well that 's a good experience i think 
and uh there are a lot of things to think about 
and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good 
and they kind of boil down to uh 
any other important decision you really have to explore the alternatives and what we found um to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were going to be loving and uh that 's more important than anything else 
um-hum 
um-hum yeah 
we could have sent uh her to a fancier um facility 
um-hum 
um she goes to a home 
this is a um a couple uh emigrated from china early in in their lives 
um-hum 
they 've been here probably thirty forty years 
yeah 
they 've got three daughters 
um and they have a loving home 
and uh they 're both there 
and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon 
um-hum 
and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends 
yeah 
so it 's a good experience 
uh that makes a big difference 
i th- 
if it 's good 
i think it 's very good for the child 
yes 
and if it 's a loving environment i think it 's very good 
and and that 's really what we 've learned about it 
she 'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of a preschool in a year but um we feel real fortunate 
yeah 
and we were able to uh just uh choose in the marketplace 
i do n't know what it 's like around uh hattiesburg 
there 's a lot of child care available but invariably there 's waiting lists 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the uh okay the university uh university 's uh uh department of um uh w- their home ec- department um they uh they have a subbranch uh american family counseling 
yeah 
i 'll bet they 're involved 
yeah 
and their people staff this this uh the child care center just off campus 
but uh they have a pretty good size waiting list 
yeah 
so 
well that 's uh 
i know it 's it 's a real uh hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities 
uh um-hum 
out here at stanford they have a you know a a a real good facility 
and there uh is is quite a waiting list to get into that 
yeah 
so it 's uh you know it 's a it 's a it 's an important decision 
it 's an industry that 's still a cottage industry and i think that it it really is buyer beware 
yeah 
w- it 's best 
yeah 
a cottage industry 's the best way to do it really 
well it is the best way to do it interestingly 
because if you over 
i think that um my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that 's a good sign and that um private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
because i think what we 're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market 
as a matter of fact my future is banked on that uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care 
um-hum 
primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life 
yes 
it 's amazing how much good things like uh sesame street will do is uh 
it 's it 's phenomenal 
it 's phenomenal the the programming the human operating system is my are- 
do you um have a family budget 
or how do you work your budgeting 
well for many many years uh my wife and i did have a budget 
uh we were both working at the time and so forth 
and um that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and and other big bills taken care of 
um-hum 
uh we have a a budget 
but not as strict now as we used to because we do n't have quite such a tight financial situation 
yeah 
so it it 's uh it 's been helpful 
i mean yes 
having a budget is very very important 
and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things were taken care of 
and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we do n't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before 
so we 're we do n't have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did 
oh well we do n't have a real strict budget 
um we have a a low budget to work on 
but we um you know 
for like groceries we saved up this much per week 
and then w- we just spend about so much 
sure 
uh-huh 
we do n't i- i do n't know of a a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything 
but i know that when i go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there 
um-hum 
a certain amount 
i think i 've i do that automatically myself 
yeah 
i mean i unconsciously uh you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i- i have enough food already stored here that i do n't have to make any large purchase at any one time 
oh 
all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there 
as the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that 
wow 
that 's great 
yeah 
we have two freezers 
and course we had a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff 
and we freeze a lot of that 
so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own per- personal storage 
oh 
oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient 
well we we keep a little note pad on a on our wall 
wh- 
if anything is absolutely out make a note of it 
and then uh the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up 
hm 
so it 's it 's worked very well that way 
at least that way we you know if each of us finds something is missing uh we put it up 
uh the other person might not know about it 
yeah 
that way we can keep up to date 
well that 's a good idea 
let 's see 
the the other thing there the topic was talking about was if you if i 
do n't all i can think of is if you do n't keep a real real tight budget how do you control expenses 
but um one 
another thing that we do is we always fly back to california and washington each christmas 
well not fly back 
but somehow we get back there 
uh-huh 
and um this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive 
and 
well actually it 's more interesting too if you 've got the time 
huh 
oh yeah 
and um you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare 
yeah 
and so um we find that if we 're careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and entertainment things like that then um somewhere in out in the wash it 'll come out that we have enough to get back there you know 
sure 
well i think we unconsciously do the same thing 
excuse me 
my throat 's not as clear today as it should be 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
uh we are uh going to be traveling to europe with a choral 
we sing with this so called pennsylvania choral and we make a two weeks tour of of uh foreign countries 
uh-huh 
and of course that costs money 
so we uh each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that that we gather together over a period a time enough money to to make this trip 
so th- that is another way of uh budgeting and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
we uh just live a normal life 
but we do n't throw any money away particularly 
we save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice 
yeah 
well whenever i do n't know if this is part of the topic but whenever i find you know a dime or something on the ground i will i 'll probably pick it up 
i do the same thing 
i have a whole pile of those things that i have found by parking meter 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i have a special little jar that i keep all the money i found in 
count it up at the end of the year something 
yeah 
yeah 
but yeah 
well let 's face it 
then 
when we talking budget it is important to to have a budget 
and uh i- i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my ch- checking account 
and i have a money market account also 
uh-huh 
and uh i keep those levels up above a certain minimum 
and i 'm always trying to 
well are you in the market for a new car 
uh well yeah 
i am as a matter of fact 
well act- actually i 'm looking for another car 
but uh uh new probably not 
oh 
what sort of requirements to you have for your car 
uh sports car 
uh-huh 
uh usually either black or red 
um 
a- and electric windows and power locks 
i see 
no 
top of top of the line 
well uh not so much that as it is 
i 've had so many times when uh uh you know i- i 'll have a friend next to me or i see somebody uh guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window 
oh 
it is just a real pain 
or you know if i 'm driving along and there 's somebody next to me and uh somebody that i know and you try to talk to them it 's real difficult to drive r- reach over and try to roll down the window 
um-hum 
right 
right 
and uh so power locks and power windows are just just things that uh uh just really help a lot 
um-hum 
um-hum 
what about you 
well i guess i 'm um more traditional in that i do n't like p- power windows or power locks because the people that i know h- who have them always seem to have trouble with them 
oh 
and um so i do n't i just do n't like anything that i can n't figure out why it does n't work 
sure 
and then i want you know good uh gas mileage 
and i want an air bag 
and uh i guess 
have you ever had a car with an air bag 
a good no 
i have n't 
have you 
no 
somehow i just think you know i like the idea 
well it it see- sure seems to save lives 
and uh yeah 
right 
i actually i like the antilock brakes 
right 
that 's a good idea 
and i 've never had a chance to 
i have been in cars that have had them 
but i 've never tromped on the brakes to see uh you know on ice or water just to see if they did n't lock up 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but uh you think you 'd buy uh an american car or a european or japanese 
well i actually i do n't know a lot about different brands 
i tend to have you know my requirements 
like the last time i bought a car i- i guess i did sort of prefer american 
and my requirements were basically you know good repair record good mileage um 
and i needed air-conditioning 
and um can n't remember what my 
oh i wanted uh stickshift 
and so i did n't have a whole lot of choice 
there was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that you know was sort of a medium priced car with a stickshift in it 
what was that 
it it turned out to be a a chrysler um lancer 
huh 
stick shift huh 
yeah 
did it have what a three speed or a four speed 
no 
a five speed 
and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and had n't picked up 
and so it had been on the lot three months 
and they were really eager to sell it 
wow 
so i guess in this area at least you know if it 's not automatic it does n't move 
well actually i much prefer a stick shift 
and what i 'm i 'm curious 
i- i know why i love a stick shift 
why do you why did you want one 
well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one 
and i thought it would be more reliable 
um-hum 
um 
it 's hard to find stick shift cars anymore 
i found that out 
i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when you went in to and they asked and said that was the requirement 
so 
huh 
yeah 
yeah 
no 
i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift 
well i 'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area 
huh 
not that i was looking for sports cars 
but now the people i 've talked to do n't seem to have stick shift 
huh 
and so why do you like stick shift 
um i guess i- i grew up on it 
and it 's fun 
it 's it 's an enjoyable part of driving 
i do feel like i have uh more control over the car 
um-hum 
and i- it to me it gives me more a lot more control in the snow and ice and slick conditions 
um-hum 
right 
uh i- i- it does uh 
i do n't know 
it it 's really more fun than anything else 
as long as you 're not stuck in heavy traffic it 's fun 
right 
um-hum right and actually it 's probably safer on you know uh long trips because it keeps you more active 
yeah 
yeah 
so 
yeah uh 
of course i like gadgets and and uh fun things on on the cars which are all the things course the c- 
well credit cards 
yeah 
i 'll tell you what i i can n't say a whole lot about credit cards because i uh tore mine up 
is that right 
i i know pe- i know some other people that have done that 
yeah 
uh i got in some problems with uh financial problems because of credit cards 
so i uh basically just got rid of all of them 
um 
i i have a a couple 
i have a uh gas card that i that i use just for gas and you know uh one that i use just for emergencies 
uh-huh 
but 
yeah 
i h- i have we have some some friends that did the exactly the same thing 
they uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed 
and finally they realized that they were they were abusing them and were n't going to get out of the hole 
and they just cut them all up except for for one they kept for emergencies 
and they 're still paying away to get out of debt 
yeah 
i know it 
but no 
i did just the opposite 
i i guess i i sort of followed in my uh parents footsteps 
i have quite a few of them 
i use them continually 
uh-huh 
but i uh i basically never charge anything i do n't have the money in the bank to pay for 
and uh and i always pay them off totally every month 
oh is that right 
yeah 
that 's a that 's a good policy 
yeah 
and it you know i mean they they 're just a convenience for me 
i do n't have to get cash out of the bank 
and i do n't have to to be writing checks 
and and uh 
yeah 
yeah 
uh sometimes i wish i had them 
but in most cases i 'm glad i do n't because i you know unfortunately i i- i do n't have the control you have 
uh-huh 
i wish i did 
but but i do n't 
yeah 
uh and it you know it 
i just do n't want to get into that situation again 
so we 'll 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i mean it it 's easy 
i mean y- you know you do n't have anything transferring just a little signature 
so what you know 
oh that 's it 
see and that 's 
even with my gas card you know i find that i 'll go in to get some gas 
uh-huh 
and i 'll end up buying you know candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever 
right 
and then at the end of the month i you know i get a bill 
and i 'm thinking what did i get that costs so much 
surprising 
yeah 
and 
well you know but the 
i mean there are sort some inherent limits there 
you 're not going to you 're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that 
right 
yeah 
that that 's true 
but i can i can under- certainly understand where 
now i 
you know 
w- 
the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know not so much discipline 
i mean well i mean you have sort of a discipline in general about finances 
but but i hate their their rates so badly i mean their interest rates so badly that i 
oh yeah 
is n't it 
that 's unbelievable 
how 
let me ask you this 
how how old are you 
i 'm uh thirty three 
thirty two 
excuse me 
thirty three 
okay 
you 'll be thirty three this year 
yeah 
you want to be thirty two as long as you can huh 
it 's coming 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i i know what you mean about the interest rates it 's uh it 's unbelievable 
you know i just that just irritates me so much that that i refuse to pay them interest 
and and my wife recently uh decided she had to go to brazil and was going to take off 
and she 's from there and and uh did n't really have the money 
uh-huh 
but you know she could pay it off 
and so i sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards 
but she 's paying it 
and uh i just wo n't do it 
i mean she 's paying i do n't know i do n't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest and i just you know i just refuse to give it to them 
oh jeez 
if i need to borrow that kind of money i 'll go to the bank 
and uh 
yeah 
and then you bet 
that 's 
uh yeah 
i in fact i 've i 've even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less uh rates and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know 
oh yeah 
right 
right 
yeah 
and i i guess there 's some there 's uh uh some negotiating there too 
because i heard uh 
on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh call you know 
if you 've got a pretty good rating uh credit rating you can call your in you know your your card uh wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees or i 'll just go to somewhere else 
right 
huh 
well i might 
you know and if you 've got if you 've got a pretty good uh uh history with them they 're more than willing to do that 
um 
right 
hum i might try that because i i have one card that i 've had for about uh i do n't know nine or ten years 
yeah 
in fact that 's that 's what this guy 
you know he wrote a book on it 
and he says that 's you know he 's tried it sev- with several of his cards and he 's just told them you know i i can get this card from this bank at this rate 
uh-huh 
and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent 
right 
it does not make sense for me to do that 
and if you wo n't drop my rates i 'll just go ahead and send you back your card 
and i 'll go somewhere else and get it 
yeah 
for me the big thing you know is the uh uh is the uh the annual fee 
and i just refuse 
i wo n't get any card now 
i 've i 've got a good rating 
and i 've got you know 
uh-huh 
and i 'm not going i 'm not going to pay an annual fee 
the only one i actually pay on is this one that i that the very first 
well this is an unusual topic 
what do you think about it 
yeah 
i at first i 
it took eight times to find y- you 
so i told my husband um you know 
what should i say 
and then he reminded me 
but um um hi- in his family uh what they usually do on his dad 's side his mom or um the aunts will send out little postcards like two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the where to meet and you know just to bring anything 
and so they just notify everyone by mail 
and then they just meet at like a park or something to have like a a short um or a small um dinner type thing 
well that sounds great ellen 
how far away do they come from 
um they come from well they all meet in portland 
and they come as far as oh seattle 
and and sometimes we 've gone 
and we were f- we were living in utah at the time 
right oh okay 
and um but his his dad 's family is all around the area 
and his mom 's side of the family they all uh have their family reunions in southern utah 
and people would come from seattle to there and um let 's see nevada and in that area washington and nevada to southern utah 
and they would um assign a different person each time they had a reunion they 'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody 
oh okay 
that makes sense 
nobody 's out of a lot of trouble more than once 
yeah 
yeah 
and the people who are down there like they 'll assign one person in the utah area one person in the washington area 
and that person can call you know beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too 
um-hum 
and then they just sort of do like a little program or you know something like that so that everyone 's sort of involved 
yeah 
that 's interesting 
you sound like you 've had a lot of experience with this then 
oh well that 's my husband 's side and my mom 's my mom 's or my f- family uh 
w- we all live in southern california 
so we just have to either call or give a formal invite 
and we 're all there 
so 
southern california 's still pretty large 
yeah 
well i mean la orange county area 
i mean everyone 's you know mostly not farther than an hour away 
i see 
and yeah 
well my experience um has been limited pretty much lately to my mother 's side of the family 
uh-huh 
uh years ago there was a big dispute on my dad 's side 
and uh they have n't had a reunion since then 
they just show up at funerals and weddings 
oh 
it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that 
wow 
but anyway my mother 's side we had our our first real reunion that i 've ever gone to last summer 
and they had people come in from out of town 
and they took s- some rooms down at a holiday inn 
and uh they had some activity 
they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff 
and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree 
and you know a lot of that sort of thing 
since it was the first one that we 'd had the y- you could do that once 
now next time we have one 
we 'll have to think of something more creative to do 
well you know that 's interesting because one thing that always brings to my uh husband 's mother 's side together is um they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time 
and ever- inevitably everyone is just very interested 
and and they always have you know two or three new ones to add to the list you know someone 's been born or someone passed away or you know something like that 
oh 
and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever 
well have have you do you have an interest in genealogy 
um uh i do but not to very much compared to my mother-in-law 
not a passion huh 
um i suspect we 'll do quite a bit more genealogy 
and i- i suspect we will do more of it 
um i found out some about some of the relatives i did n't you know i- i did n't even know their names some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles 
oh 
and uh there 's a lot of things there you have to stop 
they 're really kind of fascinating 
i found out my grandmother was one of a twin 
oh 
and we do n't even know where the twin 
we have virtually no no background on on her on the twin 
really 
is that your your grandma 's own sibling 
and she 
uh my grandmother 's uh sister who would be somewhere in in west virginia 
i 'm sure she 's you know dead now because my grandmother died in about twenty years ago 
oh i see 
oh so 
i 'm i 'm quite a bit i 'm probably a lot older than you are um 
well maybe um they just moved away and then just sort of lost contact and 
i do n't know 
so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in america today 
well i 'm think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the time than they 're given by the court system 
yeah 
but i do n't know 
with the economy the way it is i think crime can n't do much but go up 
that 's no 
i have to i have to agree with you 
i had an occasion a couple years ago to hear the r- chief of police of richardson texas speak 
and you know it 's a shame a a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things 
and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it 
and then when he gets caught he 'll be sentenced something like five to seven years 
but he gets five days credit for every day he serves 
i mean it 's like a bonus to go to jail 
right 
so subsequently a five year sentence means he 's going be out in uh a year on probation 
i mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to a s- stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate 
and uh when he u- s- uses up all that and spends all that money then he uh starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing 
well there was an article in our paper sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in north carolina the average serves six weeks 
now see that 's a you talk about that 's a crime right there 
well w- see we do n't have any room in our prisons 
so they shu- they shuttle them in and shuttle them out 
well we do n't either in texas 
and they get them get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks 
and then they 're they 're paroled uh to make room for the newest criminals 
and it just it it 's just really absurd 
well it it certainly is 
and uh that would be a huge concern 
you know i do n't think the general public really realizes this as far what goes on with our criminal system our judi- -ciary system and everything else 
it 's just uh it 's terrible the way it is right now 
i think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now so many different things coming in so many different directions that they 've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there 's absol- or they think that there 's absolutely nothing they can do about it 
yeah 
as far as steps to reduce crime if it 's uh crimes like we 're just been discussing obviously we we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to uh take them off the streets 
uh yeah 
but i do n't think that 's going to happen because just like you said 
and our state 's a good example 
your state 's a good example 
and it 's just not going to happen 
as far as the murderers and people that commit rape and things like that i 'm not sure what 's right 
but i know that i- it 's not right to put him in there and l- let him live for years and years and years years before you do execute him or whatever because it 's has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him 
yep 
and you know to i 'm sure he gets to watch a lot of tv 
and i 'm sure they have uh exercise facilities and movies and and everything else you know they can have a good time in 
well i do n't know what the answer is 
but i know that asking the question over and over and over again is n't working 
so 
no 
it really is n't 
it 's a big it 's a big problem 
and hopefully something will come out of it 
so i do n't know 
i hope so 
i 'm uh i 'm pretty much of a hard person 
uh i believe in capital punishment 
i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone 
i mean you know if it 's just downright outright 
i do n't oh i definitely believe in capital punishment 
oh 
you bet 
i mean that 's the only way to 
it 's when they it 's when they 're in on death row for nineteen years that i do n't i 'm kind of c- curious about 
oh yeah 
and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to uh take care of them and all you know 
it 's just unbelievable 
w- yeah 
you can appeal now in north carolina for a- almost a period of twenty years 
can you really 
yeah 
you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you 
i think the i think it 's uh the average is eight to ten years to get it to the north carolina supreme court and then uh after that it goes to the supreme court of the united states 
gosh 
and that usually takes another four to six years 
oh i know 
so it 's 
see meanwhile you 're living in a country club situation perhaps you know 
they 're hoping 
i guess they 're what they 're h- they 're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did 
yes 
but it just uh 
we have a serious problem 
in we have so many problems in this state right now 
and and the the thing is the the fun- the fundamental problem is the l- is 
the drug problems that 's another one 
hello 
hello 
how you doing 
fine 
i 'm lee with uh uh 
i 'm over here in plano texas 
okay 
let me ask you something can i run a minute and shut my radio off 
oh sure 
okay 
oh 
okay 
where are you calling from 
or where are you at 
arlington 
arlington texas 
arlington 
yes 
well there 's a lot of stuff going on in arlington these days 
yes 
not all good stuff 
are you involved in any of that 
no 
no 
no 
i 'm not not personally 
well uh what benefits uh d- 
now do you work 
i 'm going to school right now 
oh you are 
i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband 's or what i think 
okay 
yeah 
i 've got a lot of 
because i- i work for myself and so uh uh there 's a lot that i that i guess i do miss uh a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation 
uh-huh 
i miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come 
yes 
right 
yes 
but uh 
yes 
i 've been in my own business mary kay in fact 
i 'm selling it out now to go to school for a 
turn and i enjoyed the freedom of having that you know 
oh is that right 
go to work when i wanted to and not but you know the benefits were n't there 
uh-huh 
yeah 
so 
i uh i own part of a roofing company 
oh do you 
in the in the dallas fort worth area 
yeah uh-huh 
and uh y- you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger company and they uh you know we we had all the benefits there 
uh-huh 
and and i do miss that you know 
yeah 
but uh on the other hand i i uh i enjoy having the the time that i have with my family and being able to you know work when i want 
right 
yep 
um-hum 
and 
i think today the thing that i uh would appreciate the most 
uh because my husband gets his medical through his company 
but we have to pay for mine 
uh-huh 
and we 're the only one that i 'm the only one that 's being insured 
and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children have i mean 
oh is that right 
so it 's kind of 
yeah 
and i would 
i really 
and the way medical expenses are i think that 's probably one of the biggest benefits to ha- you need to have 
it 's 
a yeah 
it r- p- it 
p- yeah 
i 'll tell you what 
that is the single most uh benefit that i that i enjoyed and i do miss 
right 
because i looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just 
and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it 
it 's out of sight 
right 
it 's out of sight 
and uh yeah 
even at a group rate i could n't believe how much is our 
oh yeah even at a group rate 
uh it 's it 's unbelievable 
and uh the amount that you have to pay for you know for kids 
and and if you want to add dental to it i mean that 's that eats even more 
right 
it goes up 
right 
so yeah 
i guess what the other benefits that uh that i uh that i miss i guess is uh you know some of the bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company you know 
um-hum 
and course these days you can n't count on that because uh you know i feel bad for the people that are involved in that uh gm deal there in in arlington 
right 
right 
and i 'm i 'm sure it 'll be you know quite a few people are affected by that 
so 
right 
it 's going to hurt the city 
although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank 
and i would see the gm people come in when they were they would shut down to retool 
uh-huh 
they were paid that whole time 
and i do n't know if you 're aware of this ri- 
oh really 
yes 
they come in there 
just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and every friday and go to the safety deposit box 
and i 'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know 
and they had all these gr- 
is that right 
i- i really believe they have done this to themselves in a way because of the unions being so strong 
the union 
yeah 
and right now anybody that 's laid off from gm will have a full year 's paycheck 
i just read this in the paper the other day 
is that right 
plus probably an additional six months through the the worker 's stuff that they have at at uh through the company 
so i 'm so- you know i 'm sorry it 's happening because it 's going to hurt 
yeah 
but i do n't feel as sorry for them 
well really the 
if my husband were laid off tomorrow we 'd get one more check 
and that would be it 
yeah 
really the ones it 's going to hurt is is actually the the businesses around in that area 
yes 
oh yeah 
that 's already hurting 
you know that 's the ones that that that 's going to hurt because they depend on that uh 
yeah but i think there 's a case where benefits have gotten 
they voted them in 
and they got so good i mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know and it made the prices of cars go up 
oh yeah 
yeah 
and and you know the 
um-hum 
i we i believe in unions 
but they went too far 
well i tell you i i 've had my fill of unions 
i mean i can n't make eighteen dollars an hour 
i 
i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour 
u- oh ye- 
okay 
well if you 're from iowa you must be very artsy-craftsy 
everyone i 've ever known from the midwest can do everything with their hands 
oh well actually i 'm from california 
and before then i was from utah 
so 
i did n't know anyone ever moved from california to kan- iowa 
well i grew up in california 
and then i went to school in utah 
and i got married there 
and we stayed there for a while 
and then now we 're in u- iowa 
i 'm teasing only because i 'm from indiana 
oh really 
i really liked i like the midwest 
oh 
but i married a texan 
and they have a way of dragging you back home 
anyway we 're supposed to be talking about crafts 
do you um do you have any hobbies that that you do things with your hands like knitting or 
um 
well i crochet 
and i do water color 
and i um sew 
and i do fabric painting 
oh you do a lot then 
do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching 
um i 've done some cross stitching 
i have n't tried any needlepoint yet 
how about you 
um actually i i 'm pretty untalented 
oh right 
i used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting um 
but i- i do n't know 
somehow i- i do n't have the time anymore 
but i have all these friends that wherever you go they they sit down and the next thing you know they pull out of their um bags some their most recent uh needle craft and in december everyone was doing stockings you know these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings 
oh really 
uh-huh 
oh god 
oh yeah 
well those take a lot of time 
yes 
i only can do things that are pretty fast because we just um got our baby last year 
and i just do n't have the patience to jus- you know be some 
is this your first baby 
uh-huh 
have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets 
um i crocheted an afghan for our bed 
that 's the only thing 
and and i did a quilt 
let 's see i 've done a quilt for our baby 
and i 've done a quilt for our bed 
but i mean 
did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself 
or h- how did you make a quilt 
um 
um our baby 's quilt it was a pre like the design 
i just went around the design in the quilt 
uh-huh 
i did n't piece it or anything like that 
but uh 
but you actually hand quilted it yourself 
uh-huh 
and 
did did you need a loom 
or were you a- 
was it small enough that you could just hold it 
j- um i put it on the frame the quilting frame 
have you are you familiar with that 
uh-huh 
yeah 
okay 
but um my again my mother back in indiana 
we had a quilting frame in our basement 
and she would she would quilt whole quilts by herself 
oh my god 
um yes 
which 
i was always amazed 
i have one of them um 
but uh you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it 's a tremendous amount of work 
well i have n't done tons of them 
but um i used to do more before um before i had before we got our baby 
but 
have you think children 
you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children 
uh-huh 
i think when babies 
i think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and are are wonderful 
and and they 'll wear them 
yeah 
exactly 
once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear your 
well one thing that i like about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a t-shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then um cut out a little pattern from the material from some material like flowers or something and make um a design or you know a little arrangement or something on the shirt and you know fuse it on with heat and bond or whatever and then paint around it 
and i usually sew sew around the flower whatever first 
and then i paint around it 
so you can n't see the stitching as much 
doe- does that make sense to you 
so 
oh yes 
i think it 's very clever 
it 's uh funny that you said 
that for christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for ours a beautiful christmas design 
oh 
and they were matching 
and they were lovely 
but when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out i really did n't do anything else and truly everything fell off or most of it 
oh sure 
uh-huh 
oh really 
so i ha- i went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back 
and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges and and it was salvageable 
oh 
and i 
but it 's 
so i 'm familiar with that 
but i think you 're very clever to um sew around the edges 
i think gluing alone certainly would if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges 
well 
yeah 
someone told me that that it that they had done it both ways 
and i 've always after hearing that i always sewed it on even even with the uh a loose zigzag even helps 
and um 
our topic today 
uh yeah 
something about the school system here 
right 
and now i 'm sort of 
do n't know if this an advantage or disadvantage 
my wife 's a school teacher 
so 
well then i 'll uh i 'll walk softly 
no 
you go right ahead because i have a lot of strong opinions on it too 
my wife teaches seventh grade 
and you know there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system 
i think the 
i do n't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly 
yeah 
but uh for example my wife she has kids that are on drugs 
and course like everyone she has kids that get pregnant even even in the seventh grade 
what school system does she teach in 
plano school system 
oh wow 
but but to give you an example uh you know one of her kids will come in and he 's you could tell he 's just bombed out on drugs 
and uh she sends him to the principal 's office 
and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says hey your problem 
you take care of it 
you 're not allowed to send them home 
you know if you do that then your allocation 's cut from the state or the feds or whatever 
your you 
you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day 
and just it 's it 's a numbers game 
i do n't think that 's right if they 're especially if they 're interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning 
well i think it 's more of a 
there 's a bigger problem here than uh than discipline in the schools 
i think it gets back to the uh parental uh participation into the program 
yes 
um to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the garland school district 
and it 's a public system 
however you 'd think that it was a private school because they 've taken it the best teachers and the best students 
they 've taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district and uh put them in this academy system 
and to get into the system 's very difficult 
but once you 're in uh they have they have self-paced programs 
and so you have students that want to learn 
and uh you have teachers that want to teach 
and you have parents that are really interested in the children 
and basically uh there 's probably some discrimination if you want to say that uh because most of the people that are in the academy system uh are caucasian and because you have to test into the system 
sure 
sure 
and most of 
that 's not all true 
but i 'm saying a large percentage of them are 
and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about of these kids uh have college degrees at least one parent does 
and so there 's 
i think that uh that 's my justification for saying that the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they do n't know what their children are learning they 're they 're saying do your homework 
let me see it 
do n't get in trouble at school 
or we 're going to be all over you 
oh yeah 
my son had such a tough time in uh the school he went to 
but there was through 
it was n't all the school 's fault 
it was his fault also 
but we put him in a private school in richardson 
and that that cost more 
that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters 
that was more than his college tuition was but uh had to be done 
yeah 
at least it took care of him and uh threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and uh want to learn something 
but i 'll tell you what 
there 's a there there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today 
yeah 
i think what we 've done is um um especially looking at um the south dallas area is that we 're trying to bring the education level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed 
yeah 
i think we have that problem dealing in most areas which is unfortunate 
and um that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you 're not do n't have the proper education uh including uh exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can n't use a computer today and do word processing and do uh database management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you can n't function you know 
you bet 
you bet 
so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world 
and the business world then says we 're not going to pay you unless you have the education 
and then educ- and then then we what we 've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself 
we- it 's diff- sure 
well teachers you know they have a a tough row to hoe so to speak 
they just are always fighting the system 
i do n't know if it 's better than any you know 
we came down to texas from the uh new york area 
we were only there for a short time 
but my wife is from new york 
and she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything 
and i think you know the schools in the east are really a lot better than the schools in the south 
i do n't care where you 're from 
and they they i do n't know if they learn more 
but they certainly uh they have a tendency to learn more 
and in that part of the country there is all nationalities 
well what do you think about your everyday occurrences that are that are an invasion of your privacy 
uh well the uh 
what i really i do n't like is the c- the constant calls people selling things people telling me i won things you know people trying to solicit for different you know organizations 
oh 
right 
now that 's what i really 
yeah 
i think that that 's the only thing i wrote down also 
because that 's just a it 's terrible today 
i mean my wife and i it seems like i get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and and it rings up until ten an- eleven oclock sometimes 
never stops ringing 
right 
that 's right 
well you know the the great uh things of that its a is is an answering machine 
yes 
i know 
-at 's true 
i mean this is this is the one of the best inventions ever you know 
you just switch that thing on 
and uh 
yeah 
that 's true 
yeah 
but you know people 
it 's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls i mean i must get at least i probably average at least a call a day 
and and a lot a days i 'll get to and three calls from from people selling insurance you know to the small business man and uh you know i think dunn and bradstreet puts your according to what i 've understand dunn and bradstreet puts your names your name out to people also 
hum even in an office 
uh-huh 
right 
as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in new york 
and uh california always trying to sell something oil oil investments or stock investments or whatever 
um-hum 
right 
right 
and now i getting the same calls at at the house 
um-hum 
i know 
and they get you- and they get your name from dunn and bradstreet 
and uh credit card companies they sell your name 
oh yeah 
uh well you know these people they sell your names 
i mean you know i 
i know yes 
that 's also an invasion of privacy 
i think if the whole thing is a 
american express does that by the way 
oh they do 
yeah 
i understand they sell thei- you know they sell names because it 's quite profitable to them 
well sure it is 
and uh that is an invasion of privacy 
you 're right 
that 's right 
well you know if you 've ever gotten anything you know in your life your your name is somewhere 
i know 
that 's true 
i mean one magazine and boom they got your name forever 
exactly 
magazine companies uh from from subscriptions do the same thing it 's the way they make additional money 
um-hum 
that 's right 
but it 's uh you know i guess it uh 
you have to be a certain income holder to uh have an american express card 
so your name is valuable to i guess x amount of solicitors calling 
yeah 
that 's right 
so i do n't know 
whe- where do you where you from 
but oh i 'm from texas 
oh okay 
well so 
yeah 
we live in the dallas area richardson 
oh w- we 're in plano 
okay 
well you know the only call i really got that well was out of state 
i got one from oklahoma city and one from california 
laughter did you 
and that was uh california 
i was thrilled to death because that 's the you know the furthest i 'd gotten any call from you know 
and um 
yeah 
i 've got i talked to people in utah people in new york and a lot of times i 'll call eight or nine oclock in the morning 
oh really 
and i 'll get people you know from out of the uh out of the state 
oh 
yeah 
see well that 's uh tha- there was another call on saturd- saturday that was also from uh that was the one from california 
i do n't know why i guess people on the weekends from out of state 
-ill uh i do n't know you know 
but 
i 'll be darn 
where you from 
not from texas 
uh originally from new jersey 
new jersey 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah my wife 's from new jersey 
oh really 
what part 
yeah 
from uh saddle river 
oh that 's nice over there 
she 
yeah 
we 're from more uh from a sort of towards the shore central new jersey you know 
okay 
we 're like uh 
well that 's nice too 
yeah 
oh yeah 
it was beautiful 
that 's why i- i really miss it 
i- i do n't really like it here at all 
really 
ye- 
my wife 's been away si- we 've been married twenty five years 
so she she 's been away for quite a while 
uh-huh 
her dad was from little rock arkansas 
and her mother was from new york 
so they just they officed over there in new jersey 
yeah 
so their 
yeah 
so but anyway yeah this topic is it 's a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy 
but that 's the the biggest one i can think of is just all the solicitors calling 
well yeah 
i mean 
yeah 
yeah 
and and y- kn- of course they call you know 
before i got the answering machine it was ridiculous you know i said this is absurd 
i know 
i the you know i the the minute i get home the phone would be ringing 
that 's a that 's a good suggestion 
i might start using the answering machine more because you know it 's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings 
uh oh it 's great 
i mean 
well you know in fact i 've been missing calls from the ti switchboard 
because i- i i always have it on you know 
right 
and i 'll get that tha- that message that says uh t- uh to uh um uh you know uh end this call press three and i assumed i was you know was from the switchboard 
sure 
you know 
you yeah 
you 're probably right 
yeah 
it is because one day i listened you know and it was you know 
but um i- i just got totally disgusted 
and and you know people asking for for money for everything you know 
i mean i- exactly 
i understand 
i mean i 
it 's hard to believe there 's that many deputy sheriff 's association 
and 
and you know the policeman 's association 
and i know 
they call you one time to send three kids to the carn- carnival or circus 
an- oh i used to do that 
and 
yeah 
i used to do that 
i 'd s- or three kids to the movies or something 
then right 
there 's always a diff- 
and and i my my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night 
-ay i pushed it 
okay 
so what do you do in your lawn 
do you do it yourself 
or do you hire someone to do it 
uh no 
we 've been doing it ourselves for most of the time uh find that it 's really a little more economical 
and we have or i found that i have the time 
and i kind of enjoyed it over here in texas 
i used to live in arizona 
and it was very conf- very frustrating because i did n't have the watering system 
and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
but over here we get enough water automa- you know naturally as well as have the automatic sprinklers 
and so it 's a lot more rewarding so 
yeah 
right 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
well we do our own out here of there you know mow it ourselves and everything 
but um our water supply right now is bad 
we need rain badly 
oh that 's right 
uh we can water here and patterson i can water on tuesdays thursdays saturday and sunday four days a week 
um-hum 
so 
is is that enough during the hotter times of the year 
it was this last summer 
yeah 
um-hum 
uh now if it we do n't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know but um yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
we do our law- our you know mowing ourselves and everything 
and i do our planting of bulbs and things for i can have some spring flowers and uh 
um-hum 
yeah 
i- i find that i 've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before an- and it 's been real enjoyable although i did n't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold um they 'd freeze down 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and by the time they the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting 
oh 
so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of uh more of a problem than it was rewarding 
so um i 'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that you know feels 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
we have quite a few roses 
i just uh we in fact we just pruned them uh way down 
and i uh just uh uh had to replace on of them 
so i just bought that yesterday 
and uh probably go outside today and plant that 
um-hum 
but um i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long 
yeah 
those are enjoyable 
i even had uh roses on my table for christmas dinner which was really pretty you know 
oh did you 
um-hum 
but um other than the roses i do n't have too many flowers 
i plant gladiolas and those are always pretty 
um those are nice 
but they get so tall 
and they they bend over so fast you know 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yeah 
i have n't done much in in bulbs 
in fact i received as a christmas present a a a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water at any time and and after it started to sprout put in sunny window 
and it 's it just grew like crazy 
um-hum 
but i do n't have any flowers on it 
i do n't know how long that takes or if there 's anything i need to do differently 
hum 
but it 's just nice and green right now 
um-hum 
well is it that one of those amaryllis 
uh no i 'm thinking white narcissus or something like a pap- white paper flower or something 
no 
huh 
oh okay 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and uh 
do you have a big yard 
so i do n't know no 
not really 
and in plano and most of the newer areas of texas uh they have just the the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard 
we have a pool in our backyard 
and we did plan it to where we had some some play yard last over 
um-hum 
but it 's it 's um you know very small 
um-hum 
but most of the houses here if you have a pool you do n't have anything else in the backyard that 's that 's about the size of most of them 
yeah 
right 
right 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so um i guess we 're kind of fortunate 
um 
everyone looks at that with our yar- at our yard with kind of a sense of awe like wow you really got you know some grass back there 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and 
well that makes it nice 
yeah 
well it 's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool 
but we do n't have one you know 
um-hum 
but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know but we just we just have dogs and um and grass and uh you know the cement work and a little place that we made for a garden 
yeah 
yeah 
uh-huh 
uh yeah 
yeah 
so we do have a garden you know 
it 's just a small one you know 
but we had a lots of tomatoes and uh zucchini uh it 's a- it 's amazing what you can get out of a little you know it 's probably about twenty by i do n't know twenty by six something like that 
um-hum oh do you oh 
uh-huh 
and it 's amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there but it was nice 
yeah 
yeah 
a few cucumbers 
that 's one part of gardening i have n't tried yet 
and i do n't think this yard is a very 
um-hum 
um-hum 
okay 
so what are your favorite shows 
um i like watching colombo and um matlock and quantum leap 
oh really 
yeah 
quantum leap 
uh-huh 
did you see it the other ni- 
um uh-huh 
that was a that was pretty good 
yeah 
that one was 
what is 
when he 
with the psychic and everything 
that uh-huh 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
i like uh i like northern exposure and uh home improvement 
oh i well i have n't seen either of those 
you 've never seen northern exposure 
huh-uh 
oh it 's a great show 
um i also like to watch star trek 
but it 's on so late here that i do n't always get to see it 
really 
yeah 
we like it too 
have you seen the movie 
uh i have n't seen any of the movies because i just barely just like in the last year or so got interested in it 
and they 're you know already out with number six by now 
but so i have n't seen any of the movies yet 
but i 
oh you have n't seen any of them 
no 
oh well they 're good 
they 're real good 
they 're uh they 're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though 
uh-huh 
which ones are you watching the new ones 
yeah 
i 've seen uh quite a few of the older ones 
i have n't seen really the new generation that much 
oh okay 
yeah 
is there one you prefer better the older one or the youn- the newer one 
well they 're they 're a lot different 
but i like i like the older ones because at that time you know they were really futuristic you know 
oh yeah 
and the newer ones are i guess the newer ones are real futuristic too 
but i like i like both of them 
yeah 
i do too 
i have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot 
i mean he almost hates the new ones 
really 
yeah 
because he he thinks the newer one is like a soap opera and the other one is n't or something 
but whatever 
no 
it 's not really 
it 's not really like a soap opera 
oh i think 
yeah 
but but it 's 
but that 's true 
i mean you you learn more about the the characters and stuff 
but that 's the way all shows are now 
yeah 
sure 
well let 's see 
um i like to watch colombo because it 's like a mystery thing 
yeah 
and that 's sort of how matlock is 
but colombo is way tricky i mean he does n't even try to let the person know he 's getting onto them 
yeah 
well the it seems they always show colombo the same ones over and over though you know what i 'm saying like that one where he goes to college 
uh did you see the one 
um 
or those is there a series on 
d- um yeah 
there 's like one on 
well we see it thursdays at seven 
and it was 
okay 
this last time it was about this um movie director 
did you ha- did you see that 
yeah 
i saw that one 
see that was a rerun 
one really 
oh i guess i 've nev- 
yeah 
i 'm wondering if that 's see i do n't know if that 's the the movie of the week or or what 
huh 
but it seems like there 's only about four or five different ones 
and then and they keep showing them over and over 
oh i guess i 've i have n't seen it before 
he was a movie director 
and he had that gal killed 
yeah yeah 
okay 
on the set or something 
that was pretty good though 
yeah 
it was 
but i yeah 
i like colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things 
um-hum 
but um there 's no never anything good on saturdays though 
no kidding 
i do n't think so 
well star trek 's on at five 
but i 'm never home 
so 
what is it that 
there 's something i watch something i watch on saturdays 
and i can n't remember what it is 
now i used to watch twin peaks 
oh 
you never saw that 
i 've heard of it a lot 
i 've heard of 
a lot of people somehow or something 
they 'll say so and so from twin peaks or something you know 
yeah 
yeah 
that was a definite soap opera 
oh 
but it was it was a different type of show 
uh-huh 
i did n't like the way it ended though 
oh did they end the whole series 
yeah 
oh 
yeah 
they did n't they only did it for i think two years 
oh 
but it 's all over now 
oh another show i like to watch is mash 
okay ron 
okay 
welcome to the net 
and uh what did you do about your last auto repair 
oh and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth 
well larry my last one unfortunately was a an expensive one because i had a brand new lincoln town car 
and and a couple of ladies ran a stop light 
um 
the lights were n't working properly 
it was n't their fault 
but we they did n't run it 
we both had green 
and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car 
so 
my goodness gracious that 's 
that was a huge repair bill 
well that 's still not enough for a total is it 
i know 
i hated that 
to get it 's a very expensive automobile 
so it was n't enough to total it 
but that 's my that 's been my most uh expensive repair probably in the last year with the except of just service work because i buy a new car every two years 
and 
oh and do you buy one every two years 
well i travel a lot 
so you know uh this last one i leased 
uh-huh 
so i do n't know 
and i leased it on a twenty four month program 
it 's the first time i 've ever done that 
but i 'll probably go back to buying them because i do n't care to lease them 
did this car have one of these expanding balloons 
or just are there normal safety belts in it that you had 
no 
it has the expanding balloons 
did that help you 
uh it 
they did n't go off 
they did n't go off 
no 
i guess we were n't going 
that sort of upset me 
we were n't going fast enough acco- 
when i called the dealership about it and called ford motor about it 
but no sir 
did n't go off uh 
we were it was a bad rainy dark dreary day 
and and the street lights 
well wha- but you were hit in the side were n't you 
yes 
that may be the problem 
you you m- you may need to be hit from something the leaning towards the forward to uh activate it 
yes 
took off my whole front fender and hood and everything 
i tell you just took it all off 
my goodness 
it was uh uh 
my my doors were okay front and back and but it did uh right eleven thousand dollars in damage 
um-hum 
it was a expen- 
then i get it back 
and two weeks after that i 'm driving it in front of the local high school 
and some young man just was n't paying any attention and runs in the back of me 
that 's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage 
my goodness 
so so i 'm going to get 
r- my twenty four months is up on this car i 'm getting rid of this car 
i would think so 
that does n't sound like you 've got very good luck with that one 
my golly 
how about you larry 
well i 'm relatively fortunate about that 
uh here we somehow do n't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season uh students move into town who are from big cities 
and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks 
then they finally settle down and realize that they do n't have to drive that way here 
i understand 
and uh that takes the strain out off of everyone that uh is driving a vehicle 
and i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to uh take care of us in the winter time 
i understand 
uh i have a sixty nine cougar and a seventy seven pontiac so forth 
and i have to 
uh and i drive a honda most of the time 
and i have to make sure that uh salt and so forth are kept off of it 
and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it 's rusted away 
sure 
we- i understand that because i 'm from west virginia 
and we had the same thing up there c- continuously salting the roads for snow 
uh-huh 
well i just i di- i had this cougar totally uh the body of it totally rebuilt uh to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders uh done and then it all repainted 
sure 
and then winter got here 
and so i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off 
so i have n't had a chance to drive it very much 
but anyhow uh uh now are you going to buy this next car 
or you going rent it a lease again 
no 
i 'm going to i 'm going to buy it larry 
i do n't like the rental 
i think 
i 'm getting ready to retire myself 
and i 'm going to i 'm going to be you know driving a car for longer 
are you 
so i usually drive a car for three years 
and and anyway and so but last couple cars i 've only driven for two years 
um-hum 
so i 'd leased this one for two years 
so i 'll probably go back and buy one 
and uh this next car -ll probably be my retirement car 
well that 's an awfully big one that uh that one that you had the lincoln uh 
is n't it too large for normal town driving finding parking places and getting in and out the doors 
we- no sir 
not really 
not really uh no problem at all 
uh-huh 
my wife and daughter 
we have uh two toyotas in the family one nissan 
and we have the lincoln 
and uh the not really 
ah yeah 
no problem there at all as fin- as far as finding parking places 
it 's it 's convenient in that in that regard 
w- well that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips i 'm i 'm very much aware of that 
yes 
it is 
and i 'm and i travel 
i 'm like a traveling salesman 
do n't travel a lot any more 
but uh when i do take it it is very comfortable to drive 
um-hum yes 
i 'm sure it is 
because that 's the way that i enjoy this pontiac that i have 
yes 
it only has thirty eight thousand miles on it 
but it 's very quiet and very smooth riding machine 
is that right 
-ll my wife 's toyota is soon to be four years old 
it only has does n't even have thirty mil- thirty thousand miles on it 
so gosh been much in such good shape that 'll probably be an eight or ten year car 
um-hum 
do you do you feel that uh 
yeah i pushed in 
okay 
so how do you use your credit cards 
oh we use them for paying our gas for paying uh just about anything because um we do n't like to pay for our checks 
so we use it quite a bit but we we pay off every month though 
um-hum 
so we never have to pay interest 
and we always we never get the the credit cards if there 's a monthly or a yearly charge 
we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it 's free 
so we never have to pay anything extra 
yeah 
that 's me 
i wo n't use one that i have to pay an annual fee you know and um i 'm uh like you i i use it well to buy my gas with 
yeah 
we just do n't think it 's worth it 
so 
my sh- my shell credit card i use that 
and then like my emporium card and uh weinstocks card i use that 
but i 'm like you 
i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill 
why i do n't just write a check i do n't know 
uh-huh see well you i do n't do it either 
you know it 's just really weird 
but i i do n't carry a lot of cash with me because i 'm always afraid that someone 's going to steal my purse 
yeah 
yes 
exactly 
that 's how i f- 
i mean it 's a rare day when i even have seventy five cents in my purse 
yeah 
you know enough for a phone call 
and that 's about all 
yeah 
but uh other than that that 's the that 's the way i use them 
i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they 've got they c- they can n't charge any more you know 
and i think that 's terrible 
yeah 
because it 's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something 
oh yeah 
yeah 
because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit 
why it really does help 
yeah 
and i think it 's more convenient too in a lot of cases 
like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our visa or our mastercard or whatever 
yeah 
and then um you know we really do n't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
we come out a l- even a little bit ahead because we 've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later 
uh-huh 
uh-huh uh-huh 
yeah 
well i think it 's better to use credit cards too like i say because y- there 's so many people around any more that 's watching what you 're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket they 're going to hit you over the head 
oh yeah 
yeah 
even if it 's five bucks even 
i know 
it just uh you know it just seems like they 're somebody 's always watching 
so i just do n't i do n't carry money 
i 'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know 
yeah 
and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it 's twenty four hours you can report it in 
and i he said the most you 'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had 
and and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt you 'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it 
right 
and then you know you can have your card back with pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
right 
and you know some of those stores do n't even seem to check your signature or anything you know 
i know 
i do n't know why they do n't unless you have to spend a certain amou- 
i do n't know 
but i notice that some of them do n't even look you know 
they just slide it in there and pass it back to you you know 
yeah 
exactly 
so i do n't think that 's right 
i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know 
yeah 
sure 
i mean it 's just a precaution for everybody 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
so 
well let 's see 
what else can i say about credit cards 
um 
um 
oh i also use like to use discover when i can because uh you know they give you some money back every year 
yeah 
i do n't i do n't uh 
that that that 's that sears discovery card 
is that what that 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
now i do n't have that one you know 
well we just started doing that 
and you know what 
uh-huh 
it comes in handy is for when you 're buying things like um tickets for the train or um airplanes because they 'll give you some money back you know 
uh-huh 
and it 's only a little bit 
but i mean it 's still something 
we got two fifty last year and so it 's you know it helps out here and there 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
so 
oh you mean uh for for you using your credit card you get like a rebate or something 
yeah 
they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which does n't sound like a thing 
but when you you know when you add up everything you 've you 've charged up on the discover card for a year and they give you a half percent of that 
uh-huh 
and that adds up to you know two fifty or something 
oh i see 
and so that 's what 
and i know we 're going to get back more this year because they you know we spent a little bit more probably 
uh-huh 
and they do it for how long you 've been a member i think too and they increase the percentage a little bit 
um i see 
yeah 
well i 'll 
hello 
hello 
hi 
my name is dolphene 
i live in texas 
hi 
my name is pat johnson 
and i live in texas texas too 
okay

and how do you feel about putting someone in a nursing home 
well i do n't think that uh any of my relatives would really like to go there 
i- i believe that if i am in a position uh like when my mother gets to th- to a point where she needs special care that i 'll be able to just bring her into my home and my father also and um or have someone go into their home you know and um and look after them 
um-hum 
that way 
yes 
i would find it very difficult uh to place ei- my father or my stepmother ah in a place like that particularly since i know how they feel about it 
um-hum 
you right 
it 's it 's basically it 's more how they feel about it 
yes 
because it 's like they have feel they feel like they 're they 're um m- the way my mother would put it like somebody had throwed them away 
yes 
you know 
i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for you know if you 're faced with placing someone um in a place like that uh you know aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that 's offered and such 
right 
um-hum 
but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference 
and i have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home an- have no family who could c- you know care for her 
um-hum 
and uh i know that uh the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about uh her situation 
um-hum 
and a- another thing to think about um on the positive side of the nursing homes there 
i used to work uh in one of the offices in a nursing home and i got to see a lot of the things that that they did they um they had a lot of crafts and they had a lot of games 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yes 
and uh they get together and they just do they they do all sorts of things 
and then there 's 
some o- some of the uh the people that are that are in there are real n- you know very very nice and friendly to everybody and uh then there are others that are 
um-hum 
it 's a just just a job 
and they just you know want to go in and do what they have to do and get out and go home 
yeah 
um-hum 
um the the attitude of the staff as you said i- is is really uh very very important 
um-hum 
i think it would matter too uh the kinds of uh disabilities that the nursing home accepts because there are some uh who poor things you know do n't have uh any real grasp on reality any longer 
right 
right 
and they may be ambulatory 
but they tend to behave like children small children and that would be very difficult i think for an adult who was n't in that situation to ha- to have to deal with on a daily basis 
yeah 
um yeah 
ooh 
well it 's like we- the one that i worked in um you would see some of them uh just like in wheelchairs all day 
they 'd just ro- roll themselves around all over the place 
and and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities 
and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group 
and they they just did n't like participate together with the others because they they had some some uh i guess s- a slight mental disabilities and things like um 
um-hum 
yes 
what what do you call alzheimer disease and stuff like that they just do n't do n't um they were n't really together with the rest of them when they got together for such activities 
um-hum um-hum yes 
yeah alzheimer 's 
yes 
yes 
and that can 
okay lee 
tell me about your ideas on this uh the us government supporting health insurance and so forth 
well i think it 's inevitable that we are going to see national health care 
and the reason is because the market place does n't seem to have performed adequately uh 
the invisible hand that which adam smith wrote has uh provided some very good health care and uh much i think inadequate health care 
uh and in some cases the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces 
and i think um it 's inevitable 
it is just a matter of uh time and mistakes 
and they 're both inevitable 
well what is this going to do to the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing uh a good job 
well it 's going to make it tough for them 
and it 's it 's going to be a difficult transition 
i do n't know uh how it 's going to uh play out in terms of the particulars 
but i do n't think s- society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long 
our uh physical mental and spiritual health uh it 's really very costly 
yes 
uh and uh as a society we are paying a staggering price for this 
well this is what 's bothering me lee 
my 
another question 
do you think that there should be some control uh innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ri- ridiculously over priced things 
we realize that for the individual person some things are very important 
uh matter of fact in some respects their life might depend on it 
right 
but by the same token some of these charges they make for w- well minor endeavors shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
there are abuses of they 're abusive of privilege 
there should be some control of that 
yes 
and that 's what 's giving the local um insurance companies hard times 
that 's the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals 
and you get something done 
and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it 
right 
well this i think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten or twenty or thirty years will address 
because i know this is addressed by uh in canada 
i- i have a a good friend who is uh a physician practicing in canada 
and they made the transition uh 
and i think that the uh for example duplication of magnetic resonance imagers uh 
yes 
we 've had several of them 
my wife and i both have had that recent 
i 've i had one myself 
and uh they 're wonderful technologies 
but cities have uh three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need 
so i think that what the marketplace does n't do because of the way the system has worked 
and it does n't allocate resources optimally because there is a tendency uh at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills 
what 's begun to change all of that 
the people paying the bills uh employers ultimately have begun to squawk because they 've seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years 
yes 
so i think the evolution will be interesting 
uh hawaii has a system that is apparently working 
and uh it 'll be interesting to see how how uh much more attention we pay to that 
i do think though that it 's inevitable primarily because of the pain uh that people are feeling uh under the circumstances 
and i believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care 
whether it 's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers uh i do n't know 
i like that idea 
i tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very well 
uh i we would be a lot better off if we if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste 
see that that bothers me about the government 
see uh my 
that 's that 's that 's the problem with government uh uh administration of these programs 
and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with 
government is going to have to change in this regard 
do you think that the- that these insurance things should be covered on a state basis or us government basis 
you know that 's really a tough one for me to answer 
i do n't uh uh i would like to see the greatest improvement in management 
my my f- my field is the cognitive sciences 
and i recognize that a lot of these things that are done are done um as a function of the operating systems in place 
and those operating systems have to change 
and and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we 're going to develop more efficient human operating systems 
and so a state or federal application uh could work 
uh it all depends upon the way we structure the environment 
we may have to do 
okay 
so wh- now what are your opinions on recycling 
well i definitely think we need to start recycling 
i think it has got to be an individual responsibility until 
i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it 's going to be too late you know 
yeah 
i 've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand 
yeah 
i 've heard that too 
and that 's not too far away 
but i do n't know how it is there 
it 's very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much 
i take my pap- 
i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them 
um-hum 
and there 's some fire stations i can take newspapers to 
and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait -til i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile 
well see i had started saving newspapers 
and i have save a ton of them and uh th- i can n't remember where i went to take them 
um-hum 
but they wou- they would n't take them 
yeah 
it 's very hard to find a spot 
and then i do n't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible 
bottles that ca- glass 
oh i know 
that can not be it could be recycled 
but there is no place to 
there 's no really recycling facilities 
no 
we have a pilot program in arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they 're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out 
i think that 's a good idea 
and i think that 's what it is going to have to come to where we 're just forced to 
besides well like a law or whatever 
and that 's how it is in new york or is n't it 
yeah 
i think so 
it 's just because they have to you know 
um-hum 
you get ticketed if you do n't do it right 
right 
uh-huh 
and i think it 's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the 
it 's a it 's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it 
yeah 
but 
plus you have to have a place to store all of it and see i live in an apartment 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's very difficult 
like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers 
and so i do n't know 
i think there needs to be more places 
i also have a real strong opinion 
in iowa the state i 'm from uh i believe it 's gone up to a dollar now 
um-hum 
everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it 's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store 
yeah 
and you get it back 
uh so that way that kind of forces you to recycle 
you 're forced to 
and uh you also do n't see the litter there 
people just 
yeah 
that 's true 
it makes it worthwhile to take it back 
and i 've just started drinking a new water called clearly canadian 
i do n't know if you 've tried it and they have on the ba- it 's five cents okay it 's still five cents and it even shows the states that 
yeah 
i 've seen them 
um-hum 
that take them back 
yeah 
well wh- some of them are five some are ten cents 
i am looking at it right now 
is texas one of them 
texas is not one of them see 
so i have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass 
yeah 
no 
i do n't think that there 's enough being done 
now i work at jc penney at their corporate headquarters 
so uh-huh 
and we have a paper recycling program that 's um company wide 
and i do the recycling for that 
okay do they save like the paper the- they use like the office paper 
yeah 
good 
because there is a lot of waste there is n't there 
yeah 
i know there 's a lot of computer paper though that you can n't use 
right 
right 
but um we use to have uh 
i mean i- i do n't even remember how much money that they 've um m- i mean the money that they 've made from the recycling program 
they 've donated it to charities 
right 
but i mean they 've made a substantial amount of money from it 
yeah 
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage 
like i 've decided downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton you add water 
yeah 
i 'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later 
but i am going to stick with downy because they were first 
yeah 
you know i want them to have my business 
and i think packaging could be done much better 
there is so much plastic 
that 
well now 
you see some of this stuff 
and you 're and then when they come out with the new things you are like uh well why did n't you think of that before 
yeah 
yeah 
and i think it 's just people have got to be aware 
unfortunately there are a lot of people that just do n't care 
and they do n't want to think about it 
yeah 
that 's true 
and uh i just look at it as i do n't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why did n't you do something 
you know i want to feel like i at least tried 
yeah 
and i do n't know 
it just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it 
then we 'll be forced to 
it may be too late 
do they not ever i mean i do n't know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like 
very little 
that 's another thing and 
if you 've ever know 
then that 's pollution 
like i know amway 
i only use a couple things form amway that it says this is burnable material 
well that does n't do me any good because i do n't have any place to burn it 
yeah 
i know 
i guess you run into the pollution factor 
yeah 
and then just like the glass bottles th- that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in texas 
yeah 
and there 's no place i can take glass to 
truly 
so i still throw away a lot of glass 
sad 
yeah 
and then the packaging really grips me 
you buy something 
it 's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plas- 
-kay 
so how 'd you just figure 
well you know it depends upon our weather here you know 
today was a beautiful day 
it was like uh uh summer day 
it was seventy degrees 
so so i dressed in um uh a light weight skirt 
wow 
it 's a uh ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan over it 
uh-huh 
because i had some appointments at the office today some interviews 
and so i had to dress up anyway 
and then i wore heels you know 
uh-huh 
but when it rains a lot which it has been doing here a lot lately uh very often you know wear uh pants and boots you know 
oh 
so how do you dress 
huh uh well um i 'm going to talk about when i was working as a teacher and when i was um what i 'm what i 'm doing now 
okay 
um when i was a teacher um in utah i would generally wear um dresses and heels and things like that 
um-hum 
and even when it um rained and snowed i just braved it 
and i wore heels anyways 
yeah 
because and 
i c- i can see 
i i 've been a teacher so has my daughter 
and i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that it was tiring 
i know 
it might kill you to go and walk up to the door 
that 's right 
but you 're going to look nice for the kids 
that 's right 
and it always makes you feel like you 're a bigger person than the kids right 
oh oh yeah 
well i need all the height i can get 
yeah 
i do too 
so to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades uh older grades i had to wear heels 
oh yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
me too um 
if it was real- it looked really dangerous then i would wear boots 
but then i would change um into heels as soon as i got to my desk 
um-hum 
so um 
well of course we wear uh an unlined boot you know 
it it has a heel on it 
that 's the kind of boots that i wear to work 
and we wear them you know 
they 're a leather boot that you wear 
as i said they have a regular heel on them high heel 
oh 
and they wear them we wear them a lot with shirts and things 
uh it 's kind of a 
well i guess a custom down here in texas that you wear these boots 
they 're not a cowboy boot 
but they 're just a real pretty boot 
but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain 
oh 
as i have a private high school that i run here and so when i 'm interviewing a parent of course i feel like i need to wear heels you know and look like i 'm a business person you know because the children will tease about where 's your motorcycle if you wear boots too often you know 
sure 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah oh 
huh oh well um 
of course you probably wear coats a lot 
yeah um 
the first two years i was in a room where they did n't heat it 
so i did 
oh my goodness 
so then you had to 
yeah 
and the third year we um got heating 
so it was nice 
yes 
then things improved right 
right 
uh-huh 
but of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know you know 
oh that 's nice 
and uh that 's very seldom 
we it depends upon our winter 
we have a few days you might wear a coat winter coat you know 
but most of the time you can wear a sweater 
and we just do n't wear coats much 
we often laugh about even when it turns chilly 
we 're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we 're so used to running around like that 
uh-huh 
oh nice 
well 
it 's really different 
let 's put it that way 
are you not teaching anymore 
uh no 
we we moved to iowa 
and um i 'm working at a day care right now 
i see 
and so the way i dress is really different because i 'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months 
oh so you do n't wear heels anymore i 'll bet 
yeah 
i wear uh tennis shoes and jeans and things that you know are sort of um 
yeah 
uh-huh 
more practical 
not 
yeah 
if it does n't matter if i have to wash it a hundred times or something 
w- when you were teaching did you ever have uh uh a blue jean day or anything like that 
yeah 
but i never wore jeans because um i thought that was too casual 
ye- yeah well 
for 
i know that in some of the schools they have uh country western day or something like that when you know or tacky day 
and i always thought it was kind of out of got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too 
yeah 
really 
it 's all right for the students 
they look tacky a lot 
but i did n't think teachers should you know 
yeah 
that 's how i feel too 
yeah 
uh do you like uh uh iowa 
um oh it there 's some good things about it 
that i 've seen a lot of things i 'm not used to yet um 
where did you live before 
um we lived in utah before 
and and i grew up in california 
oh well that 's quite a change from california to utah 
well i guess we 're uh forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution 
i hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars 
and low polluting f- fuels are being experimented with ethanol and other types of fuels 
uh yeah 
one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from or sources 
i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories 
that 's what i would think 
but i i do n't know for sure 
i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in canada from what 
comes over the border from us 
right 
yeah 
i think the automobile definitely is an area uh any any industry that burns you know 
and then i do n't know about chemical pollution 
i 'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air 
i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution 
they have offices that are too well insulated 
they found people are getting sick 
yeah 
but i do n't know if that affects outside 
you know i- i think seems to think seems to me that 's what they were asking about was outside 
and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories 
yeah 
the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes 
yeah 
um i guess there 's been a lot of pressure to um do away with the cfcs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem 
right 
yeah 
that is well that 's destroying the ozone is n't it 
again i that 's what i hear 
and and there 's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there 's a hole in the ozone or not 
but at last i heard it was uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially 
yeah 
yeah that 's it 
it 's kind of scary 
well it is scary 
and i think it will uh continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively 
yeah 
we 've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment 
yeah i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces 
i- i i 'm wondering whether it 's going to get to the point where you can n't do that 
i think it will 
in los angeles they 're apparently going to 
they 've passed laws that for habit for example people using uh barbecues gasoline lawn mowers um 
uh-huh 
and it 's really bad in places like los angeles 
and it 's gotten bad in denver 
right 
and and uh it 's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky 
and people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars 
right 
and our economy seems to 
and this i think is one of the big problems 
yeah 
in this area too since you know in texas we 're so spread out 
yeah 
we have to drive so far 
but i know in colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh it just stacks up at the when the rockies starts 
but we 're even getting it here 
we can drive into when we 've been on vacation or something drive into fort worth or dallas 
and you can tell it in the mornings too 
my husband likes to go out and jog 
and there 's just a brown fog here 
and we do n't even have any mountains that are holding it in 
yeah 
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets 
well that makes a lot of sense 
i mean i- i had n't thought about it that way 
but it it 
you do n't have to have mountains there stopping it 
yeah 
and uh they make uh making more and more high-rise buildings 
and uh so yeah 
we can comment 
and we did n't see this a few years ago 
no 
and i think 
it was pretty clear here 
yeah 
and i think that that more and more it 's becoming apparent to people that the earth which includes all the people on it and everything that 's going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a uh a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it 's going to tell us about it 
right 
and uh we 're going to feel it 
and i think it 's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars 
um-hum 
yeah 
and i- in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable 
for example taxing people heavily for using their cars 
yeah 
and uh i 'm i have a little sports car that i enjoy using 
and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive 
but i think uh we 're going to have to make some fundamental changes 
and and i 'm i 'm not sure how long it 's going to take or what it 's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and houses we sell 
yes 
and it 's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that 
it 's a lot of waste 
but 
okay 
gene 
so it 's nice to talk with you 
and um food is a very intriguing thing 
our lives are are built around foods that we like and and nutritionally good for us 
yes sir 
what kind of dining out do you like 
well there is two kinds 
one i guess i 'd say is with my wife where we enjoy uh oh i guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant 
oh 
uh you know something nice 
yeah 
and the other is with my whole family whom we uh go somewhere that the kids will enjoy 
uh recently we 've been hitting pancho 's up 
it 's a local mexican restaurant 
uh-huh 
pretty heavily because they 've got a good rate on the you know good prices and everything 
pancho that 's a new one 
yeah 
yeah 
um-hum 
it 's it 's a chain down he- uh 
it goes up into colorado and down here 
i do n't know where else it is 
what about you 
we had one called chi-chi 's in this in our area 
oh yeah 
and uh we had a restaurant called la bamba 
but it 's just it closed recently 
but chi-chi 's is a national restaurant i think 
is n't it mexican 
i think think it might be 
do you have it there 
i 've see- i think i 've seen it around 
yes sir 
uh-huh 
yeah 
well i love mexican food myself 
oh do you 
yeah 
but you go ahead now 
oh we we do too 
we uh we enjoy mexican food 
i 'm just not impressed with the quality of it 
it 's just primarily the price that 's uh satisfying at this point 
but the kids seem to enjoy it 
is that right 
uh-huh 
um and uh let 's see 
we 've uh just recently discovered a super restaurant down here 
but it 's uh not part of a chain 
it 's just an individually owned seafood restaurant 
but the first one we 've been to that uh i do n't think there was anything on the menu that that any of us had 
that was uh not just really super 
it 's nice to find a place like that 
oh boy that is wonderful 
you know yeah 
well i- i agree with you on that 
and i wa- was really a seafood addict myself 
i- i love crab meat in particular 
um 
i uh i can almost live on on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if had to 
oh boy 
have you ever been to uh what is it original book binders in philadelphia 
i know the name 
but i have n't been there 
uh that 's an old established uh restaurant 
i used to go there when i was in college 
uh-huh 
where did you go to college 
i went to the naval academy 
oh the --- naval academy 
and we used to we used to go up there on uh for football games sometimes and have some liberty 
uh-huh 
and 
yeah 
we 'd go over there to uh 
pretty sure it was original original book binders 
i think it was 
yes 
i 'll be darn 
i have n't been back there in years 
well we 're we 're supposed to be talking about dining out 
but i 'll just make one comment that uh i just retired from penn state 
and uh all my work has been in research for the navy 
okay 
what area 
underwater acoustics 
is that right 
did you have any dealings with the uh underwater sound reference laboratory in orlando florida 
i have dealt with nearly all of the all of the research laboratories that the country has 
yes sir 
my dad worked there for years and years 
um-hum 
that 's wh- that 's uh that 's where i grew up was down in orlando 
so 
oh you grew up in orlando 
uh-huh 
that 's uh that 's interesting well i was in submarines uh 
well that 's what i worked on 
okay 
yeah 
must have had some interesting uh assignments for you there 
wh- when did you retire 
uh end of last month 
well great 
i 'm sure you 've seen some interesting developments in acoustics 
i certainly have 
yeah 
so wh- i hate to uh 
i wish i could talk to you about that uh 
but uh i guess we should continue on uh 
okay 
okay 
right 
first 
how do you like chinese food 
oh we we do enjoy that 
yes sir 
uh i do n't know if we 're particularly adventurous 
we find something we like uh like cashew shrimp or something that 's got a good uh at a particular restaurant 
and then we usually stick by it 
but do you what about you 
uh-huh 
well i uh enjoy the szechuan type of uh chinese food 
hot 
yes 
um-hum 
yep um 
it 's it 's 
i i do a lot of chinese cooking myself 
i have in the past 
i have n't done it recently 
but uh it 's in the sweet and sour porks and things like that are just really delicious meals 
um where did you learn how to do chinese cooking 
um just at home 
um-hum 
i- i enjoyed the food 
and i bought a lot of uh good cookbooks 
and i 've been following through on that 
when you find the right cookbook why it works out 
uh-huh 
what 's a good reference cookbook for chinese food 
okay 
well that one 's a good question 
here it 's right under my nose if i can find it 
oh boy 
i guess one of the things we 've uh started avoiding is the uh run of the mill chop suey and things like that 
yeah 
right 
but we enjoy trying uh different kinds of chicken or uh s- you know even uh shrimp uh dishes that are fixed in a chinese restaurant 
one of the the this book i have is called chinese cooking made easy 
um it 's a paperback 
and i think it 's by someone named chang 
yeah 
isabelle chang 
okay 
thanks for that uh reference 
yeah 
yeah 
i think you 'll enjoy that 
-kay 
good 
yeah 
well it certainly is nice talking with you gene 
and uh what is your phone number at home 
okay 
well why do n't you start because it said i was suppose to ask you what do you 
do you have any elderly relatives currently in uh in a nursing home now 
yes 
i do 
do you 
i have a grandmother 
she 's a hundred and two 
oh my gosh 
she 'll be a hundred and three in august 
uh-huh 
and we decided not to put her in a nursing home 
she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town 
and then my sister takes care of her 
uh-huh 
she even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties 
right 
she still has her snap 
she takes care of her own business 
this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker 
but with somebody that needs around the clock care 
i have seen my family age 
right 
i 've seen them in the 
she 's been there ten years now 
and i have seen them age twenty in the time and and with the expense and everything 
yeah 
i th- i still think it is worth it if you if you had a good nursing home 
and they needed some quality care 
i would put someone in a nursing home 
right 
my mother-in-law finally 
they had to make a family decision 
there 's seven children in my husband 's family 
and fortunately four of them live in the same home town 
and she has alzheimer 's 
it was getting where she was getting th- dangerous i mean letting strangers in and things like this 
um-hum 
but they were very fortunate 
it 's a small town 
and she happens to room with one of the doctor 's mother 's 
and then she 's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time 
oh well that 's good 
but she really does n't 
nobody thought she would adjust 
but she 's adjusted beautifully 
oh that is great 
but then i am also facing my father who is very sick 
and my mother and father reside in colorado 
she 's been taking care of him 
i do n't know how much longer this can last 
and at that point because he requires round the clock 
he can n't do anything without her 
he does n't know when to take his medicine 
and it 's really sad 
and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for uh 
my brother 's are not interested in helping me 
so i would have to move him down here 
that way 
i want to see the nursing home if i have to put him into one 
you know where i can go see it 
i i 'd be very uncomfortable with him being in colorado 
and 
why yeah 
i 'm sure you have got some really good nursing homes around dallas 
yes 
and some of them are limited care too where people can do uh 
like they have apartment styles 
but that would n't work for him 
i think he 's beyond that 
where if you need help you can get it 
but basically people kind of have a small apartment 
and doctor 's are available if they need them 
um-hum 
i- i- i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in austin 
and allows 
yeah 
yeah 
well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive 
of course i guess all nursing homes there is 
but 
where and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have we have to be a pauper 
right 
it it takes every penny 
they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care 
yeah 
right 
and that 's the sad part about it 
yeah 
i s- uh 
yeah 
and i think a lot of people who do it now 
in colorado it 's interesting 
i talked to my mother 
they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home 
and my mother could make it on that 
what she probably would do is disburse the money to me 
and then i would send it back to her 
so that 's probably what would happen 
um-hum 
i think that 's what most people do 
you just have to give it everything away 
yeah 
it 's unfortunate 
i- i- i work at a brokerage firm 
and i have seen so many people that just have to gift you know their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home 
right 
yeah 
it 's frightening 
and i guess uh i do n't know how old you are 
i 'm forty six 
you know we 're the generation moving into this 
and i do n't know how our kids are going to take care of us you know 
i can n't imagine 
i 'm twenty nine 
yeah 
and everybody in my family 's always had 
we do n't have any children 
everybody that has has them later in life 
yeah 
so my my mother and my father are in their late sixties 
so i mean they 're not that far away 
right 
-eah i also fill in my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise 
and he 's still living at home 
and i do n't know how he 's ever going to get on his own the way things are 
oh i know 
and so it 's kind of 
sq- you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations 
but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older 
uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother i uh you know i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay 
but you see these people in their seventies yeah 
it 
but yeah 
most people are n't 
most are n't 
that 's the problem 
and that 's the bad thing 
i would hate to have lived so long 
she lived by herself 
my grandfather passed away before i was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety ninety one and just did everything and it but most people are n't l- 
that 's incredible 
hobbies tonight 
yeah 
sure 
okay 
well let me go ahead and press one 
okay leslie 
i 'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies 
what do you like to do in your spare time 
well a- when i have my spare time i do enjoy 
that 's a cherished commodity now days huh 
that 's right 
um i do enjoy uh sewing 
uh hand you 
know i do some needlepoint 
oh great 
and i i 've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law 
that if i i ever get enough spare time he might see it one day 
uh-huh 
a- and some other things i like to do are is music and um also reading 
what kind of music 
so well i enjoy singing 
oh okay 
yeah 
well great 
i enjoy music too 
and i uh 
one thing that i like to do uh is sit down and and play the piano 
i can n't play that well 
but i uh sit down and enjoy playing musical selections that i familiar with my family family 's familiar with 
um 
i enjoy that 
um-hum 
uh couple of hobbies that i also have is uh 
i en- i really enjoy bike riding 
and the biggest hobbies i have right now are my kids and whatever they 're involved in 
yes 
like my uh oldest boy is involved in soccer 
so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play uh throw the football 
and uh they also like to ride bicycles 
so we 're riding bicycles 
and so a lot of the hobbies that i have right now are are centered around my my children and also things that my wife and i like to do together 
hm yeah um-hum 
and uh so personally lot of the hobbies that i had when i was growing up um in going to college and so forth are have changed 
um-hum 
i really enjoyed uh mountain climbing 
i really enjoyed skiing um and a lot of outdoor activities 
and uh there 's not a whole lot of mountains here in in texas i can go skiing with that right now 
that 's right 
but hopefully i 'll be able to get back to the slopes someday 
so 
yeah 
i i 've not had the opportunity to to go skiing 
but i grew up in arizona which had some mountains around it 
but uh never did get out and ski 
um-hum 
you did n't 
no 
i never did 
did n't have the i guess i did n't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing 
and of course i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken p- places 
i could n't go by myself 
yeah 
that 's true 
that 's true 
but and then of course then once i got to the age where i could 've done it myself i had other interests i guess 
so 
oh yeah 
i guess tha- for me it was very helpful 
my two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing 
oh yeah 
and so we we went quite often 
and uh i- fact my brother still does a lot of skiing 
and when i lived around in that area my brother would fly in from chicago 
an- we would we would go skiing and enjoy that 
um-hum 
so but uh luckily it 's it 's kind of unusual because hobbies it 's a it 's a nice thing to have 
and it 's it 's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time but like you mentioned 
and i am finding out a lot of the spare time that i had is n't there 
um-hum that 's right 
it 's uh it 's uh taken up by activities with uh work with family with um civic and church responsibilities for me 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so 
yeah 
i i find that if i 
i- make i have to make myself t- realize that it 's important to get out there and not you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me 
oh yes 
oh yes 
oh yes 
yeah 
and my youngest daughter is going to to be starting up soccer 
so she 's real excited about doing that 
well great 
so we 'll we 'll be busy with that again 
wha- again 
so you 've participated that in the past 
pardon me 
have you pa- participated in that in the past 
well i did with my older daughter and she was in it for a few years 
uh-huh 
but she 's got so many interests herself that we had to start eliminating 
and that was first one to go 
she still likes her piano and she 's in band 
uh-huh 
so so she 's got lots of hobbies or uh activities going on 
s- it sounds like her life is full too 
yeah 
i imagine your life is full taking them around all over the place 
very much 
keep that 's right 
that 's right 
all right 
all righ- 
well leslie it 's been very nice talking to you 
is there anything else that you 'd like to mention tonight 
um 
or 
no 
i think we covered it pretty good 
okay 
great 
thank you for calling 
well thank you 
and you have a nice evening 
you too 
bye now 
allen 
uh the question is concerning the changes in the roles of american women in the past several generations and you know the in their in the society we live in 
what do you think has occurred there 
well i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home 
that 's probably even one of the major changes i see over the last period of time 
um-hum 
but uh are are they being given the full uh honor for the work they 're doing and for the um oh my gosh can n't think of the word but for the what they have to accept well that 's that they 're responsible for 
it absolu- responsibilities is what i 'm trying to say 
oh i do n't think so 
i think it 's come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities but i still think in lots of job markets they 're not treated as equals 
uh-huh 
in the words in some in some respects the other direction that in some job markets they really do n't want to be treated as equals 
by the same token most in in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who been there before but at l- lower salaries 
yes 
i think that 's generally speaking pretty true 
i- is that right wrong 
and i think that 's what we really ought to look at that going is if they 're going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay and that uh they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions and i do n't think we 've gotten there yet 
is that yes 
um-hum 
yeah 
what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years 
any individual thing or is it just a general switch over 
oh boy 
i think it 's generally that switch over 
and i and i think that switch over has been more in the work force 
i do n't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force 
i think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband 's having them on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home 
um-hum 
so they have one and three quarters jobs now whereas the husbands have one and a quarter 
i have a feeling that business with a woman working out at the same level of responsibility as their husband sort of tears into their social or their loving relationship in that uh the the lady s- wants to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has every right to do so and this upsets the man because uh we 've always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household 
yeah 
so do you think that is going to be uh difficult saying as far as uh marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years 
yes 
yeah 
and i think also in terms of parenting 
i think there 's going to be some increasing problem because i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting 
and i 'm not sure they 're becoming any more skilled at it 
um-hum 
because i think it really has put some add- additional stresses on family units 
well do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occ- occur in the next generation specifically 
well i- i think one of the things that always happens is i think we 'll swing to one end whereas you know where were moving at to the end where a lot of women will be at work and then i think we starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties 
um-hum 
and so i was saying you know this career thing is n't all it 's cracked up to be 
and i want to go back and do something else 
so i think we 'll probably see this swing pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit 
um-hum 
although so much of it 's driven by economics right now 
yes 
people have gotten out and gotten use to two incomes coming in 
well i actually 
mo- 
lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can be brought in at lower salaries because that 's what everybody else assumes they 're going to get 
yeah 
and the people 
well how do you feel about women in uh armed services 
well i think they ought to have the right 
i- i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to com- and or my wife or my daughter 's going into combat but i have problems with men doing that 
yeah 
and i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it 
um 
it 's nothing i 'd be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for 
yeah 
i somehow can n't do that 
i 
we- i was brought up in the ages when the ladies were kept home safe secure and made happy 
and the men went out and took the responsibility of earning the money bringing in whatever they needed and and protecting the household 
and it and it really still bothers me 
and i spent plenty of years in the service 
but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there 's two or three of them there and five hundred men around 
them and how are they going to protect themselves so to speak 
i agree 
it puts them in a very bad situation 
i i i really do n't go for that 
well i think one of the other things that concern has concerned me a little bit 
and i think i see some change in attitudes there 
my wife happens to be a wife who 's chosen to stay at home and there 's a a te- has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who did n't have much intelligence because if she did she 'd be out in the work force uh and fulfilling herself 
um-hum 
yep 
well that 's not fair 
because i te- i can tell you one thing 
stay home sometime and start uh doing some of those jobs that she 's been handling 
and you 're going to learn there 's a lot of responsibility in just keeping a home going 
and i hope we reach the point where whatever w- women chose to do that 's acceptable 
yeah 
if they chose to go into the work force that 's okay 
yeah 
if they choose not to that 's acceptable 
and if they go in the work force they should be treated as nicely as as well as a man or any other person 
as equals 
and uh not 
um 
so you have a son 
i have a an older son 
yeah 
he does n't have any children yet though 
uh-huh 
uh he 's thirty seven 
and i do n't know if he 's ever going to have any or not 
but i do have some neighbor kids lots of little neighbor kids 
um-hum 
that 
i go out 
and uh i play ball with them 
you know it 's 
because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers and it just seems like she does n't have any time for them which is kind of sad you know 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
yeah 
so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them 
so i will go out and play catch with them or you know we ha- let the dogs outside 
and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs 
but uh actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids 
i would think so 
when you when when your son was at home did you um working 
did you work 
or were you able to stay at home with him 
no 
when my son was at home i i did work 
and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about uh five other kids that she baby sat you know but we always had our days off together 
uh-huh 
and we went camping on vacations 
so we had a lot of time together that way you know 
yeah 
well when my mom uh when i was growing up my mom worked too 
but she worked nights and uh as a nurse 
uh-huh 
and so she was always home for us and i always i really appreciated that having her there when i was you know when i came home from school and when i worked 
uh-huh 
but now when i look back at it it must have been a really difficult thing that she did for us 
oh yeah 
well i am sure it was you know 
but uh i do n't know what the families are really going to come to nowadays because they just there just does n't seem like they do have time for their kids 
because most most of them the father and the mother both work you know 
yeah 
so it 's really rough 
um i have one neighbor that 's uh 
the father is a fireman 
and he works like four days on 
and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days 
but he can n't make enough as a fireman to support his family you know 
so he 's got a second job 
um 
so he 's you know he 's not home very often 
yeah 
and that 's you know 
the kids i know miss that 
they really do 
you know 
uh a family without a father is it 's a it 's a really hard thing 
yeah you know 
and i do n't know 
i i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because you know he is out working trying to make some money for you know we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth you know 
uh-huh 
but uh 
kids i think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway 
oh i 'm sure they would you know 
so are you planning on to having any children 
or 
oh yeah 
oh yeah 
um-hum 
our uh-huh 
but we 're um we just got married like like december 
so we 're going to wait a year 
um yeah 
and then we will try 
well that 's good 
yeah that 's that 's what my uh daughter-in-law had told me that they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage 
uh-huh 
and they will be married nine years this year 
so i do n't know 
she 's a nurse you know 
and uh she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids 
so maybe they just decided that uh if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night 
yeah 
that 's a possibility 
you know 
but uh 
yeah well we really want to have a family 
we feel like that that couple you know 
you 're not giving enough of yourself 
and you should you should be sharing your family and giving your values to you know making something better of of the world by raising up good kids and letting them know they 're loved and stuff 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
so 
right 
right 
right 
give them give them an edge 
but we feel like like the first year needs to be devoted to uh making the the family the couple strong and secure in their love for each other 
uh-huh 
right 
right 
but then a family is is definitely a high priority 
yeah uh 
do you plan on staying home after you have your children 
or do you do you work or what 
well i um i 'm in a different situation 
i am a missionary and i 'm home on on furlough 
uh-huh 
it 's called like 
i 've worked for four years in africa 
and i come home for a year 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and then we go back for four years 
but my husband and i will do the same job 
and we 'll be living in in africa 
and we 'll be working together 
um-hum 
so uh we will we will share the job of raising the family 
i mean as a mother i 'll have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have 
but still we 'll share that job 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but we have then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program you know that kind of thing or do you send them away to boarding school 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and if you do that when do you do it 
and that 's a 
okay 
um do you want to go ahead 
or 
oh sure 
um well i um went to school at madison for two years 
and they 're really big on women 's rights and and equal treatment 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and so i- i seen a lot of like rallies and things like that 
but um i 'm not that liberated 
i mean my mom 's kind of old fashioned you know 
um-hum 
so i you know you pick up some traits from her and stuff 
but um i think it 's i think it 's interesting and better for women to see that there 's more more of them doing men 's fields 
i like to see that 
and i do n't like to see women you know like waiting on men hand and foot 
right 
but you know i- i believe in like sharing and doing things for each other 
i do too 
i like the idea 
i see a lot more um 
my children i have five children 
and they 're all married 
um-hum 
and um i love seeing the men help the women so much 
right 
and they both cooperate together oh 
and i think it 's great 
oh me too 
i hope that happens to me someday 
i mean i- i do n't mind doing stuff 
um i have a boyfriend 
and like i 'll make him dinner and stuff 
but you know and he 'll help me do the dishes 
i do n't want him you know expect to have to clean up then after 
righ- right 
yeah 
that 's right 
that 's right 
yeah 
so 
yeah i 've always taught my men that 
they better clean up with their women and help them 
if they did that you know 
right 
and they 're they 're good about it 
but it is neat to see them all work together 
and a big thing though i see all that most of the most of the women getting married now uh go ba- have gone back to you know 
um-hum 
they they stay at work or go back to work or whatever 
right 
and they 're well educated 
um-hum 
and i believe we 'll see a lot more ceo 's in companies 
they 're having a fit about how little there are 
oh 
and i think we 'll see a lot more do n't you of upper management than we do now even 
oh yeah 
um-hum 
right 
i think it 'll escalate 
yeah 
and uh and i think black women now 
if in fact i work at a high school 
um-hum 
and my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple months and already promoted 
and she 's very sharp 
and i think that in 
the ethnic thing will be you know is a good thing now 
oh me too 
they 're moving them up 
and they 're sharp 
and they 
so you 're going to see a lo- m- a lot more of that in leadership i believe 
yeah 
i like to see that 
i think it 's um really neat to seeing all what educated minority um person who really knows what they 're talking about 
um-hum right 
and it 's just too bad that some people you know still look down on them just because of their color you know 
right 
that 's a shame 
especially black women 
yes 
so 
yeah 
but they would n't know what they 're doing 
right 
but i 'm not big on subserving as far as to the men at all 
um-hum 
right 
but i never have gone along with that you know even far back 
but i was brought up pretty good in a home that 
years ago my mother was that way 
the same 
my b- 
the our you know 
some people say oh the boys should n't have to do those jobs the inside jobs 
but we never were taught 
they had to do as much as we did 
so that was good 
right 
same here 
yeah 
so that 's i think that 's good to keep the equal as far as as uh not nece- nec- uh necessarily by sex type thing you know 
right 
same here 
you should be able to accomplish as much 
and i think the uh attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now 
um-hum 
you see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you know you can do it 
yeah 
if he can do it you can do it type thing 
yeah 
exactly 
i i see more men um like participating in like the family things with children like you know helping to take care of them more and and um um doing the jobs equally yeah 
um-hum 
um-hum 
right 
what about politics on it 
oh 
do you think the political scene 
i 'm not that big on politics 
i 'm not that educated on it 
yeah 
i 'm 
i 'm real di- i 'm kind of disgusted this year because i do n't see many women into the political scene 
and i really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do up for and even for president and vice president this year 
oh yeah 
i agree with that 
there 's nobody again 
i think they 're all scared out after tha- after um 
oh what was the lady 's name that ran a couple of 
fitz- 
i forget her name now 
oh i do n't know 
but you know who i mean 
yeah 
i know who you 're talking about 
yeah 
she took such a rough go of it 
and they ta- their tax deal and 
uh yeah 
at least she was strong enough to like try it and you know 
right 
right 
so that 's good 
but i wish they would get some more on tha- 
i really was disappointed this year when i see any of the candidates talking that they 're talking about 
um they i did n't see any of the women in there 
um-hum 
and that disappoints me 
oh 
and right now i do n't think we have too many tha- uh in the forefront 
schroeder 's about the biggest one in washington 
um-hum 
congress woman 
and um other tha- uh you know 
we really 
-kay 
well are you a fisher person are you 
yes 
i love to fish 
what k- great 
what kind of fishing do you do 
well it 's mostly from the rivers and lakes 
in california 
and yes and from the banks 
i do n't like to go out on boats 
oh 
well what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods 
well it uh 
down here we usually catch catfish and bass stripped bass you know where i fish and trout up at uh lake shasta when i go up there 
uh-huh 
oh 
but i like it all except uh really i do n't i do n't really care that much for the trout 
i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout 
well i i do n't blame you 
i grew up in nebraska and uh grew up fish cat fishing in the little blue river 
and then uh we moved to uh south dakota and uh did a lot of walleye fishing on the missouri river 
uh-huh 
and uh now that we are down here i think a lot of people do uh some bass fishing and striped bass fishing 
but uh i still uh i 'm sort of a catfish man at heart 
i see well uh like in uh iowa and nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish huh 
yep 
yeah 
they do 
you know that 's what i mean cause i am from iowa 
oh 
and uh you know we use to catch those little bullheads 
and that 's they look just like baby catfish 
yeah 
you know uh did you get to go fishing very often 
oh yeah 
i like to fish 
the only problem is i just moved to texas 
so it 's been a little over a year now 
but uh i i 'm not quite sure what uh residency is for a fishing license here 
uh-huh 
and i so really i have n't gone fishing for about two years now and it 's uh driving me crazy 
uh-huh 
but uh one of these days i will go over to uh lake louisville or uh what is it uh roy hubbard lake roy hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while 
uh-huh 
well uh you like to eat them after you catch them 
well yeah 
sure 
because there 's are a lot of people that like to go fishing 
but they do n't like to eat them you know 
you bet well mo- 
yeah 
most of the time uh if we catch something we 'll take it home and eat it 
um and you 're right 
i i mean i like to fish for trout 
and they are really uh uh good fighters 
but uh if i went to a restaurant that probably would n't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu 
yeah 
i know 
if i go to a restaurant and order fish it 's usually either salmon or uh red snapper you know 
yeah 
well uh so do you just uh uh skin your catfish 
or do you fillet them out 
how do you how do you 
we sk- uh skin them 
do you 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
yeah 
just cut their heads off and skin them 
and then i just uh flour them salt and pepper them and cook them 
yeah 
i do n't put that corn meal on them 
no 
you know uh that 's the way my mother taught me to fry them 
so 
well that 's how we do it too 
uh although we uh use to set some uh trout lines out 
and we 've caught you know fourteen fifteen pound catfish 
and sometimes those are good to uh do on a barbecue grill and just uh leave the skin on and uh do it with uh butter on uh on an on tin foil and then the skin just basically scrapes right off 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and uh we 're and it really tastes pretty good 
yeah 
well you know i do n't think i 've ever tried cooking those uh catfish quite that big 
there uh 
uh most of them are just the small you know pan frying ones 
yeah 
so uh 
well i 'm hoping one of these days i 'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on uh a rod and reel 
but uh so far it 's just been on uh on the trout lines 
um 
so 
would n't that be something 
yeah 
it 's a thrill when you get a big fish though is n't it you know 
yeah 
and uh well and up in uh south dakota on the in the missouri river there we 've uh tied into a few northern pike 
and uh they really uh 
i- in the in 
when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish 
but in the summer time they 'll uh give you a run for your money 
uh-huh 
so when you were when you did go fishing where did you go 
you moved there from where 
nebraska 
uh-huh 
yeah 
so it was just like the the rivers and uh and the lakes i suppose huh 
in in nebraska 
yeah 
uh yeah 
most of the time uh we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and uh a lot of them ended up being close to the river 
so if the river ever uh flooded you know then obviously they 'd dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits and so we 'd do a lot of fishing there too 
uh-huh 
but uh south dakota did n't really have much for 
-kay 
i think the first thing they said 
i 've written this down 
so it would 
is it p- do you think it 's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government 
okay 
you 're asking what my opinion about whether it 's possible to have honesty in government 
yeah 
well i suspect that it is possible 
uh i think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody 
right 
that 's a good point 
but um other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty 
that 's an int- yeah that 's interesting 
i had read something one time 
and it was just applying to governments in general 
it was written many years ago 
it said that is impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers 
and i thought that was interesting 
it was n't just talking about our government 
it was just government in general from times past you know on 
um-hum 
and 
so they 're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers 
right 
and that would be a next question to ask 
how many do you think are in there for pub- for but 
because they want to be of service to us 
or are they in there for their own gains 
and personally i feel it 's probably there 's probably some of each 
b- right 
yeah 
but i think maybe a lot of them um 
say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more a matter of not what can i steal while i 'm in office but how many friends can i make while i 'm in office 
um-hum 
yeah 
and you know how good a name can i make for myself and so forth 
so i guess it would be like anything else 
yeah 
the president of general motors probably has the same 
oh yeah 
and they talked uh 
the other let 's see 
third question was how m- how much self-serving for their own gains do you think goes on 
then they 
that 's hard to answ- 
i 'm sure there 's a lot but i agree with you there 's a lot in business 
i think that 's just i think that 's very normal that we should not ex- i mean 
i think i 'm i think a little more honesty in campaigns would be more to the point 
i think we put too much on politicians 
we expect them to only be there to serve us you know 
yeah 
if you knew what you were getting when you voted uh 
that 's a problem is n't it 
yeah 
it 's interesting 
because i 'm taking a texas government class right now 
and one of the things i always reali- 
it 's so easy to blame them to b- 
a lot of times i think it 's our own fault 
they lie to us because we do n't want to hear the truth 
yeah 
they say you get the government you deserve 
and if 
if they tell us the truth we do n't elect them and especially with all this front co- stuff coming up here lately about people 's past 
um-hum 
and i do n't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore 
it 's hard to imagine 
because it 's i think it 's gotten just care- well 
we 're not talking about issues we 're talking about somebody 's personal life 
and and we 're getting away from what we ought to be looking at 
yeah 
and it almost seems like in order to avoid uh some of this scandal you would have to have the kind of life that you would only find in a say in the bobsy twins or something like that 
right 
you know i also think it 'd be funny if we could kn- know everything about the people that were in there and threw them out 
i do n't think there would be too many left 
so you 're taking a government course 
you know um-hum 
at what 
at the university 
uh at uh it 's tcjc 
tex- tarrant county junior college 
oh 
yeah 
okay 
and it 's really it 's really enjoyable 
i like it 
and they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption 
and i do n't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally 
you can make laws against corruption 
yeah 
but that does n't mean 
but that does n't eliminate it does it 
i do n't think making laws will stop it 
i mean i do n't know how many laws you 'd have to have 
i mean 
well they 've got laws against canni- cannibalism but that did n't stop that guy in milwaukee did it 
you know no 
sure did n't did it 
so no 
i think you can legislate 
but i think there 's no way that you 'd eliminated all by legislating 
and we 'd end up with so many more laws that you know 
i mean i just think that 's human nature that you 're going to have corruption in government in business personal life i mean you know 
actually i think other countries may have it worse uh 
the japanese government is always having a some kind of a scandal 
right 
usually involving the prime minister or people very close to him 
yeah 
it 's so uh 
yeah 
i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes 
but when i think about where i 'd want to go you know this is still the best 
or i can 
yeah 
i 've been around to a few other countries 
and i uh i- i have not found one yet that i would rather live in 
i think uh 
yeah 
yeah 
at it 's worst i think we 've got the best 
that 's it 
yes 
what do you think are possible changes in the uh the way trials are conducted these days 
do you like the way some people in there for instance really take over and uh we have no way of knowing whether they 're legitimately right or wrong so forth 
yeah 
what do you think about these things 
well as i look at our trial systems 
i think they 've gotten to be quite a joke the way that people can appeal and file for mistrials 
and they 've taken a lot of the things that that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage 
i think that a jury should listen to the court uh to to the hearings and to everything 
but i think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision 
i think the judge should hold the fi- or maybe even forty nine 
and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other 
you you 're so you 're saying you you think the judge should actually have the final say 
i think he should 
and i think that there should be more than one judge 
there should be maybe two at least that sit in and listen so that there 's no way that you could have like a crooked judge 
hum 
do you know what i mean 
yes 
i know what you mean 
um and i think that there it 's important to have a jury but i think the way that they go through so much time to get a a fair one 
that 's okay too 
as long as it 's not used to delay the trial so much 
they need to have a fair jury 
but they only wou- you know would cover fif- forty nine percent of the decision or fifty percent 
and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision 
well i had n't uh thought of it from that point of view before 
how do you feel about that 
i have been in a fairly important trial 
and uh what bothers me is i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and uh accurate decision 
right 
that 's the part that bothered me about it 
um i really think that the the the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they 're guilty or not 
but i also think that the jury should be uh very very uh carefully more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely in- intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accu- accurate decisions 
right 
i hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and do n't know much about any of this stuff 
and and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time 
right 
that 's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem 
right 
well what if they used you know 
i just had a thought come as you were talking 
what if they used law students and had that be credit hours to sit in trials 
that would be certainly nice 
sh- let 's say 
we we would have fifty percent of them law students at any rate yeah 
yeah 
at least 
at least on the jury 
yeah 
and that would give them experience in the courtroom 
um-hum 
and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major 
that 's a very neat idea 
and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial 
right 
that 's right 
that would be a really good thing to do 
that would be a a really good thing to do 
so -at 's 
i i have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial 
hum 
and what happened was her husband was um involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stop light 
and ran into the motorcycle 
um 
but the reason the actual reason that the motorcycle person her husband was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle 
he was just taking it home from the place 
it was brand new 
and his brakes did not work 
for goodness sakes 
and this expensive big company that owned these motorcycles um railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady 
and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened and they were following him home in the car saw the whole thing happen 
um-hum 
oh they saw the husband get 
that 's right 
they were following him home from the motorcycle shop 
yeah 
and they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials um this and that and the other 
every time she 'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of a of a settlement 
they 'd find something wrong with it 
until finally they won and said that it was the drunk driver 's fault 
did they really 
and she would have to sue him which i would think it would be some his fault 
uh-huh 
but i just felt like justice was n't served because they had the money the big lawyers and she did n't 
that is a shame 
you 'd think there would be enough uh people who saw the accident other than his wife to to also uh make statements 
right 
and they have nothing to gain one way or the other 
so if they say a certain way then why not believe them 
right 
and i do n't know all the details on that 
but i certainly think that we 've come up with a good idea with the the stu- the students coming into the jury 
yeah 
and i do n't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge did n't have the final say 
um-hum 
i 'm i 'm ready 
why do n't you go ahead and start off 
okay 
well i do n't have an elderly person that i could send to a a nursing home or anything 
my both of my parents are dead 
but i did have a friend that was in a convalescent home uh like a nursing home 
and i h- went there very often to visit her and uh made me feel really sad 
if i did have a mother living i do n't think i could do that 
i think they would be better off being at home with their family you know 
i agree although we 're in that situation right now 
uh-huh 
we have a an eighty seven year old mother-in-law living with me right now and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently 
um-hum 
and even moving from her house to our house has been tremendously unsettling for her 
um-hum 
and we have several young children and they about drive her crazy 
um-hum 
oh i can believe that 
yes 
because most elderly people can n't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that 
in a situation like that maybe it would be better 
well we 've you know we 've struggled a lot with it because again uh most of the nursing homes i 've been in are very depressing to me 
um-hum 
and she 's still alert enough that i think she would really know that we were putting her there and i think she 'd really resent it 
oh yeah 
and i think that would make it very hard 
um-hum 
but on the other hand i see my wife with 
i guess our youngest one now is five and her trying to struggle because her mother really can not take care of herself 
oh 
she needs to be bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of things 
uh-huh 
oh see now that 's that 's that 's really a sad situation 
and so the drain on the family 
yeah 
really you know 
and when the kids have kids come over you know she 's always saying well why do they have to be here 
why can n't they send them home 
it 's too noisy 
and she 'll say that to the kid 's friends 
i just um-hum 
yeah 
right 
right 
so it 's a hard situation either way i think 
yeah 
in a case like that you know you more or less think it it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where 
and i think that 's one of the things we 're really wrestling with 
when does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that as opposed to considering her current circumstances 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and 
uh-huh 
but the cost of these nursing homes are so you know 
oh prohibitive 
a lot of people can n't afford that 
yeah 
you know so you really have no choice that way if you you know if you 're not rich or s- you know 
um i know this lady that you know that was a friend of mine 
now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there you know 
and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there 
yeah 
so 
i think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care that 's more readily available you know 
um-hum 
i think if we could send her someplace for the day and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her and then in the evening have her return and be with the family 
yeah 
then bring her back home at night 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
you know just come home for dinner 
and then usually they want to go to bed pretty early anyhow 
yeah 
you know so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that 
but 
but there 's not many of those available right now and they 're very hard to get them into 
right 
and we tried sending her to a senior citizen center 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but they 're really not prepared to cope with her because she 's somewhat senile 
um-hum 
and so a lot of the activities that they 're engaged in she can n't participate in 
um-hum 
um-hum 
hm 
but i think it 's an issue that you know 
with the graying of america we 're really going to have to as a as a country figure out how we 're going to deal with this 
um-hum 
because it is a difficult situation 
and you know you hate seeing them just sort of send off and not well cared for 
yeah 
if if they do n't know anybody and they do n't know what 's going on around them and everything like that well i can see maybe a nursing home would be better you know 
and yet 
but if they they have their wits about them and everything why it 's kind of hard 
and then i think it depends on their physical ability too you know 
if they could be up and doing some things it might be better than when they 're just sort of needing almost constant supervision and care 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
well uh my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that 
and uh luckily i mean she lived by herself 
and then you know one day she had a heart attack 
and she was gone 
so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that 
but there 's so many of us kids there was like seven of us that my we would n't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow 
yeah 
you know she could 've taken turns living with each one of us you know for a sh- a sh- a period of time because we all do n't live in the same city anyhow o- nor the same state 
so 
do you live at all close to each other 
uh uh a c- i have a couple more that live out here in california 
but then i have a broth- 
i 'm ready 
all right 
do you exercise uh during the day time or go to a gym or anything 
oh 
yeah 
i i used to go to a gym um last summer 
but then i started school again 
so it 's um so i do n't exercise as much as i 'd like 
um-hum 
but i i do enjoy um going to a gym and working out 
or just like i do sit ups sometimes before i go to bed or when i wake up 
and i ride a exercise bike a lot 
so 
uh-hum 
well i try to do it at night before i go to bed 
um-hum uh-huh 
um it 's really weird 
because i 'll get down on the floor 
and i 'll holler and tell my cat nikki 
i 'll say nikki i 'm going to do my exercises now 
and she can be upstairs in the bedroom 
and i do n't know 
she knows what i 'm talking about 
you know pretty soon here she comes 
so i lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercisings you know 
um-hum 
uh i had a problem with my back 
so when i went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back 
um-hum 
oh 
so i just try to keep that up because it seems like if i do n't then then my back gives me a problem again 
right 
so i try to do it every night 
and uh 
oh that 's good 
yeah 
it seems like it 's you know 
i can tell when i do it and when i do n't do it you know 
um-hum 
so you know it 's got to be good for you 
right 
but um a long time ago i belonged to a gym but uh now i notice that this in this small city that i live in they do have a a gym that just opened up here about a month ago 
uh-huh 
hm 
so i was kind of thinking about joining it 
but i have n't even gone down there and talked to them yet 
yeah 
but um it does really make you feel good 
and i like to bicycle too 
oh yeah 
so that gives you you know lots of exercise 
yeah 
it does 
yeah 
so 
i enjoy that a lot 
i um bike in the summer 
i belong to a biking club here in kenosha 
um-hum 
and um we go on a like fifty to a hundred miles every sunday 
oh my goodness 
so i try to uh keep up in the winter with the exercise bike so i 'm you know can be in shape 
yeah 
otherwise you would n't be able to go very far huh 
and that could no 
huh-uh 
no 
i go with my dad 
he exercises a lot more than i do though 
oh really 
oh yeah 
he 's always exercising 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
but i 'm not that energetic 
yeah 
i can get lazy sometimes 
yeah 
well like i say i just do it at night you know 
and um 
yeah 
do you like you try try to get my stomach muscles toned up 
oh yeah 
that 's what i like to do 
you know because boy they seem like they really get out of shape 
and once you get out of shape it 's hard to get back into shape you know 
um-hum 
yeah 
so i just been doing it i try to do it every night you know 
yeah 
like i say it just i 'd rather do that than watch television anyhow you know 
oh 
wow 
so it just kind of nice and especially when i have my cat th- comes down and joins me 
oh yeah 
that is neat 
you know so well i guess that 's about all and i can tell you about my exercising 
i wish i knew how to swim 
but i do n't 
so i do n't go swimming 
yeah 
um i do n't swim much neither 
um-hum 
but they do say that swimming is really really good for you you know for every part of your body 
yeah 
um-hum 
so i wished i i wished i did know how to do that 
if they had a pool here in patterson i 'd probably you know put my bathing suit on and go down there 
but they do n't have a pool in this small city either 
oh 
so well listen then 
it 's been nice talking to you 
yeah 
i- nice talking to you 
okay then 
okay 
bye-bye 
um bye 
-kay 
well what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody 
i think they should 
i know i had a job until let 's see a year ago this past december 
i was working for pie 
and they closed 
and naturally while i was working for them i had health insurance 
but um for me to try to get it now uh it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at at pie 
good grief 
that 's just almost unaffordable is n't it 
right 
it really is 
and i think you know i think the 
god the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high 
well i wonder if they could n't just provide uh interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that 
that might be a step in the right direction 
i do n't know 
well the thing is you know jobs are so hard to find you know 
uh-huh 
and then what you can get out here in 
anyhow in the valley where i live at now they do n't want to pay anything for health insurance at all 
no benefits you know 
um 
you mean the uh the employers 
yes 
uh-huh 
i mean you get a job now 
and the wages are really low 
and uh 
because everybody 's competing for jobs 
yeah 
and they do n't want uh to pay any benefits 
so you just you know pray to god that you do n't get sick 
well i used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do 
i i have to think about it some more now because my doctor is uh actually he 's canadian and uh he told me that there 're a lot of uh lot of counts against the canadian system which is basically the one people are talking about for here 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i do n't understand the arguments exactly 
he says it restricts your choice of doctors and and so forth 
i 'm not quite sure i understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does 
no 
i do n't understand that either 
i mean we 're on a private insurance plan right now uh actually uh i have my own business 
um-hum 
and and we 
um-hum 
uh our health insurance is through my wife 's employer 
and uh and every year we get another list of what doctor 's we can go to and where we can buy or medicine 
and and uh it changes every year 
yeah 
it 's always so confusing 
so 
well i know the plan that i had with pie i could go to any doctor 
and i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled you know 
then i just sent cards in and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine 
uh um-hum 
and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that you know 
well yeah 
of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the uh the limits of uh compensation 
um-hum 
but of course that is restricted choice 
so i do n't think that the restricted choice really uh has to do with the difference between uh public and private health insurance 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i think it has to do with the the the uh attempt to limit cost does n't it and uh everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way 
uh 
so 
yeah 
that 's true 
that 's true there 
well um i guess the most sensible thing i 've heard about this is they they say people are trying 
well 
you you you have to recognize that if you 're going to have the very best health care possible and uh available on demand whenever and wherever you want it then it 's going to be expensive 
yeah 
right 
and if you want to pay less then you 're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that uh lavish 
um-hum 
and uh 
but there 's just so many people that can n't afford to pay anything you know that 
people that 's on unemployment 
yeah 
well what happened to reagan 's safety net anyway 
i do n't 
did he take that back to california with him 
using it for a trampoline now 
know yeah 
probably so 
i do n't know 
but it is it does seem to be a big problem you know 
i do n't know what they 're going to come up with 
but um i sure wish they would come up with with something 
and uh like i say 
and and i 'm at the age too where the 
i 'll be fifty seven in june 
and the people do n't want to hire people this age any more 
and i worked for my previous company for twenty six years you know 
so it 's kind of hard you know 
so 
yeah 
they 'll be needing you in a couple of years because they 're running out of kids down there at the other end 
and 
yeah 
they 'll be calling at my door huh 
but any how 
uh well if they 're smart 
yeah 
now i i do think the government though is going to have to do something uh with this problem because it you you know even to go to a little doctor out here just to ask him anything costs you forty bucks you know just for the visit 
uh-huh 
and then he 
then that 's not counting what medicine you 're going to buy and everything else you know 
and he might tell you well you know now you 're going to have to come back in a week 
and then that 's another forty bucks plus whatever else he decides to do to you 
right 
well uh what is your favorite kind of music 
well i have to say my favorite type of music would probably be uh classical music 
oh same here 
oh really 
yeah 
what type of music do you like in the classical area 
or what era do you era do you like the most 
oh well i guess i like a wide range uh everything from uh from baroque through at least some modern music 
um-hum 
and my wife and i these days are especially into opera 
we 've been sort of opera fans for a few years now 
um do you go to the operas that they sing english or go to the ones that they sing other languages 
well we uh generally 
the places we 've gone they sing in the original languages 
um-hum 
like the dallas opera here normally does i guess 
um-hum 
yeah i- i have n't gotten into that too much because i uh if i do n't know the story line and um i do n't speak the language then i have difficult time comprehending what 's going on 
well one thing that 's helped us a lot is that uh you you know you can buy a lot of these operas now on video casse- uh video tape 
um-hum 
and so we have quite a collection of those 
and you watch them at home 
and they have subtitles 
so you you figure out what 's going on after a while 
and then you can enjoy it in the uh theater 
but you know the uh dallas opera now has uh super titles on on all their performances i think 
what is that 
well they they give an uh an english translation on a on a screen up above the stage 
oh i did n't know that 
yeah 
that can help people like me 
in fact they even do that for operas sung sung in english because it is hard to understand the words some times 
well i can understand that 
so i 'd say vivaldi is probably my favorite uh composer 
yeah 
well i really like vivaldi 
uh he 's uh definitely uh one of the one of the top of that era 
yeah 
i like baroque music 
i like full body music uh with the uh uh with brass and winds wood winds instruments uh 
um-hum 
course i like uh also string instruments 
and i have two string instruments in my house uh instrument players 
both my sons play string instruments 
one plays a cello 
and the other one plays the viola 
oh 
so i get to go to at least four or five concerts a year 
uh-huh 
how how old are they 
uh one is thirteen and one is eleven 
so they 're doing this in school or what 
yes 
uh-huh 
yes 
well you 've got half a string quartet there 
sure yeah 
we 're on our way 
yeah 
so uh um i try to enjoy all of it 
well since you seem to like uh italian music have you ever uh gotten into gabrielli or anybody there in that era the uh uh period right before actually before vivaldi i guess 
um a little bit 
but um a lot of the um music i do n't know about uh as far as the titles 
and i have to listen to it and and figure out what i 'm listening to 
uh-huh 
um i do belong to a musical heritage society 
oh yes 
uh-huh 
do you belong to that 
no 
i do n't 
but i think i know what it is 
is n't that a uh uh see 
can n't you get records through that or something recordings 
you can get recordings 
uh they now have them on compact disc or uh or cassettes or lp 's 
um-hum 
and uh they do their they do a lot of original recordings themselves 
yes 
yeah 
i think uh 
uh but they also uh they also uh go to the different composers or the different i guess 
uh what do you call them the guys that orchestrate the con- the conductors 
uh 
uh yes 
right 
yeah 
they go to conductors uh 
and and they actually have them perform the music 
and they record it 
so they 're actually commissioned performances 
sure 
a lot of them are 
uh-huh 
or they will know find out when they 're performing 
and they will uh record the music at that time 
and so uh it is uh uh high quality grade music 
and of course now they 're getting in they also have a jazz section 
and they also have a uh more contemporary and american uh composer section 
uh-huh 
well i have goo- heard good things about the uh music heritage society 
but if i get involved in one of those things i end up spending all my money on the on the music 
yeah 
well you can control it 
or almost uh almost uh bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when i got into the columbia record club many years ago 
uh oh really 
yeah 
my room mate signed me up 
he got a bonus record 
and i got a lot of bills 
i see 
so we have to watch that 
huh well that 's good 
uh do you play an instrument yourself 
yes 
i- i play guitar and and early years played saxophone 
okay 
okay 
do you uh do any woodworking 
i do 
and i really love it um 
oh um what do you do 
for a hobby or for 
uh-huh 
i do it for a hobby and i have my own equipment 
um-hum 
and i have a jig saw and a scroll saw and uh in the process of getting a router and so i like to cut out my wood and then tole paint on the items that i cut out 
um-hum 
what kind of things do you like to do with wood 
well i 'm not the one that cuts them out 
my husband cuts them out but um he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw because the stroll saw is is a lot slower and then um he 's got a router 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but now he wants a plunge router 
oh 
yeah 
but anyhow he cuts them out 
and then i i took a tole painting class to learn how to paint them right you know 
oh 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and what we want to do is you know make them and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and s- and see if we can sell some of them 
uh-huh 
yes 
but uh i really like it so far 
oh that is fun 
and then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood so i took a pattern off of that 
um-hum 
and then it 's just a wooden doll with a painted face and then you you make the dress for it 
uh-huh 
and you drill holes around the top of the head 
and you you stick in uh like rope and tie ribbons around it 
oh 
uh-huh 
the twine 
yeah 
those are so cute 
it looked really cute you know 
so i 've got a couple of those started 
they are really cute 
yeah 
and then uh but as far as wood work that 's all we 've been doing right now 
oh that is that sounds really fun 
i love those well they have a really fancy boutique out here in ogden utah and i just got back from that today 
um-hum 
so if you could get your projects into boutiques oh they are wonderful 
um-hum 
you could make a lot of money from those 
what do you do 
i wonder how you 
you just they buy them from you 
or you just give them to them on consignment or something 
uh apparently 
with that boutique um they take oh what was it twenty percent of the sell price 
um-hum 
you would put your sell price uh and then they would take twenty percent off of that at the counter 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um i see 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and so and then at the end of the boutique which usually runs for a week then they give you what you earned 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so you have to decide what your price is going to be and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so if the customers are willing to pay it then you get a profit 
yeah these little things are so cute though you know 
they are 
i 
i- i have seen those 
those are darling 
i went through some of the books down here at the craft shop you know and uh there 's a lots of little things you can get to cut out 
um-hum 
in fact i just sent to shop smith back in ohio for a rocking horse pattern 
oh oh 
oh that 's what i want is a shop smith 
yeah 
we well gene 's got one of those too 
that 's my ultimate 
oh does he 
oh that 's my ultimate dream 
yeah 
so anyhow 
oh you 're lucky 
yeah 
well uh he 's retired now and um i 'm kind of semi retired 
um-hum 
my company went bankruptcy 
so i 'm drawing my pension from them 
but i 'm still looking for a part time job you know 
oh yeah oh oh uh-huh 
but um he has all day long that he can you know work on this stuff and do do cut outs like that you know 
oh 
how fun 
and he 's got a lot a lot of tools 
so it 's just it 's just getting started you know 
oh how nice 
i 'm jealous 
yes 
but um these little wooden things they seem to sell really good 
um-hum 
um i know a lot of people that have gotten them you know 
my next door neighbor every time she sees something she thinks it 's so cute she wants to buy it you know 
uh-huh 
oh 
so i 'm just hoping that you know that we can get some cut out and painted you know before su- summer starts because we do n't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time you know 
uh-huh 
oh 
uh-huh 
but um 
well how is the market for things like that in california 
it seems it seems like they go real good you know 
uh-huh 
i mean the country anyhow out here and i live out in the valley and country seems to be the in thing out here you know 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
oh 
everybody wants little country pieces 
so anything that looks like it might be country is what they want you know 
hum-um they just snap it right up huh 
yeah 
oh 
and uh this little rabbit that i made in uh tole painting class you know is like a welcome 
it 's got a it 's going to have little wooden hearts holding it in its hands and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts 
um-hum 
oh 
and 
all right 
okay 
so what do you think of the giants 
uh i like the giants 
they got uh 
i probably did n't get into baseball until maybe maybe f- three years ago really so uh but i- i i just like the giants 
yeah 
i d- i do n't know why 
i really got into them 
i read uh dave dreveki 's book his autobiography and 
oh yeah 
yeah was n't that something of him 
yeah 
that that was incredible 
yeah 
that 's really a 
really proud of him though the way he 's you know 
the way he handled that entire situation yeah 
yeah 
really you know 
but i just think the giants have a good team 
they they got all you know 
they 're they 're rea- they 're real balanced out 
they got real good pitching 
and they got the hitting to go along with it 
so 
yeah 
i just do n't understand why they 're not right up there on the top you know 
yeah 
they just they need that i think they just need that one one element to push them over the top you know 
i do n't really know what it is 
but but every team that 's that 's really good seems you know 
like the a 's had they had they just had it all that one year 
so 
um-hum yeah um 
i was mostly an a 's fan you know 
i had been to more games at the a 's than i have in the giants because uh i lived in oakland you know for some time 
yeah 
yeah 
but uh i still like the giants though you know 
yeah 
if you if you 're a fan you got to stay with your team any way you know you good and the bad 
yeah 
right 
but it 's it 's kind of hard 
i still we- basically 
the the 
me and all my friends around here since we do n't have anywhere 
i mean we can go to the astros or the rangers teams 
but since no- me or none of me and my friends are really really like either one of those teams 
so we uh about the about the mo- most baseball we get is either tv or we play it on nintendo 
yeah um-hum 
we play rbi baseball on nintendo 
so so that 's just you know that 's small town trying to make it through the through the lu- not being around it really 
yeah 
right 
right 
yeah 
but 
yeah 
right 
well i prefer ba- uh football over baseball 
yeah 
but uh 
yeah 
so do i 
but baseball is still you go- you got to do something when football ai n't on 
yeah 
it 's 
so 
so add hot dogs baseball and apple pie 
huh 
yeah 
exactly 
thi- this is america 
so 
yeah um 
uh but 
so what do you think 's going to happen this year to the teams 
uh i do n't know 
it 's hard to say 
i have n't really really 
you have to just keep up with everything in the off season 
it 's kind of hard to do 
at least you know you have to read the paper and sports illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and and all that 
i know 
but like i say if they can if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the giants can do it 
yeah 
well the giants yeah 
they just 
i do n't 
you 
i do n't really know about the a 's 
i do n't like the a 's uh 
matter of fact i can n't stand the oakland a 's 
just because they have that you know they 've got their jose canseco and and all the attitude that goes along with that you know 
the kind of 
yeah 
makes you sick does n't it 
yeah 
you hear what you hear did you hear what he did 
yes 
he ramming his ca- wife 's car 
and i- i was like yeah 
he 's like a little bitty kid huh 
see that 's just yeah 
he 's just a a a little boy with a lot of money 
so 
yeah 
that 's just you know 
but 
yeah 
well i guess the giants or might move away from san francisco it sounds like 
yeah 
i 've heard i 've heard talk about that 
you know uh they wo n't be that far away 
but san francisco it 'll be hurting anyhow 
yeah 
they 're not going to be happy about it 
you know 
but i hope they can do good 
i mean that 's just 
i think they 're a good team that just need that one one little thing to push them over 
i do n't know exactly what it is 
they got 
they 're pretty balanced out all the way through 
it just might be the drive you know more than anything else 
um-hum 
they just they probably just need something to push them because i that 's that 's the only thing i can see that 's holding them back is the ambition to do it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
or somebody basically 
maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can n't do it 
maybe that 's what you know that 's what some teams need 
look at the twins going from worst to first 
i know 
is n't that something you could n't believe that 
so yeah 
my roommate 's a my roommate 's a twins fan for- forever 
huh 
so he had his year this year 
so 
yeah 
i just 
it 
we we got quite pre- we we got into that a whole bunch 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
that was a that was a series to remember for sure 
um-hum 
so i saw all seven games of that 
so that was definitely worth watching 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
i could n't believe that you know 
yeah 
i do n't uh 
there was braves in that chanting that they have 
that would drive you up a wall 
yeah 
they 
e- every every team with the indians been doing that now 
you know 
and it and it i can n't figure out why 
i 've yet to figure out why they 're all doing that 
i 'm like it does n't work 
it 's obvious it does n't work because the you know the braves the braves did n't win 
god yeah 
well you 're right 
so uh why why keep on doing something that did n't work 
but i do n't know 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i was i was kind of surprised that we 're going to talk about baseball and i get a woman 's voice 
i was i was i was thinking uh-huh 
i talked to a guy named vinny last night about fixing your car 
so 
oh really 
yeah 
i got i called got a call the other night about about fixing your automobile up 
so 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but well baseball baseball 
yeah 
right 
it 's it 's kind of i do n't know it 's kind of odd that they 'd 
do you pick the topic 
or does the computer 
no uh 
they give you a list of things that you want to ta- 
afternoon doug 
it certainly is uh going to be a pleasure to chat with you 
uh-huh 
and i 'm uh certainly was surprised to uh to hear from you 
normally i talk to people in plano texas 
yeah 
me too 
how did you get on this list 
uh through nancy dalgren 
she um she had somehow gotten the information from ti and was distributing it around 
oh okay 
all righty 
well now what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy 
d- what ideas do you have on that doug 
um see i 'm not sure that 
i do n't think they 're necessarily widespread in this country 
but i think that the opportunity is definitely there for um people to invade your privacy when they want to 
i think it 's um 
in what in what manner 
well it 's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone 
it 's completely trivial to for instance listen in on someone 's car phone or walk around phone since they 're just radio signals 
um-hum 
it 's um 
and let 's see 
well what 's the first thing that comes to your mind 
well the thing that i thought they were uh concerned about was was people c- calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something and in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations 
uh-huh 
and i thought that was uh beginning to invade the privacy of people because the things about where you live and and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business 
and they in return come back and try to sell you something with this uh additional knowledge 
to me that 's an invasion of privacy 
yeah 
i agree with you there for sure 
um and i think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get you know 
it 's possible for almost anyone to get information about your credit history for instance if they just um twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they 're calling the credit company 
uh-huh 
it 's you know possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history not to mention change it if he wants to 
you mean your history in regards to uh the charge card company or something like that 
well um 
well yes 
well for instance yes um 
and they 'll probably goes into other things like you know your records with the government or utility companies or anything 
do you consider these serious uh problems 
since um uh not not yet anyways because i do n't think they 're widespread enough 
but i think they have the potential of becoming serious problems 
um-hum 
well what should we do about it 
or what could be done about it do you think to correct it 
um i 'm not really sure because the i mean society is going more and more electronic 
and there are certainly benefits to its doing so 
and it 's hard to hard to say whether the um risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not 
and i 'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they do n't 
um uh why 
do you see any out for us 
well i would think that uh information held on records uh by any company or charge card dealer or or person should be absolutely p- private and and not be allowed to be uh to given out by those companies 
uh-huh 
i mean it it should be made a a uh national or a state law to protect people so that uh you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies 
uh-huh 
in other words if you call the company yourself directly uh and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else uh you know from the outside so to speak then you 'd you 'd feel more free to uh to go into detail with them but but we have no control of that now and then uh you you 're when you 're talking with them you really do n't want to tell them everything that 's on your mind because you you feel that it someday might be used against you 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i 
supp- uh-huh 
okay 
um what type of magazines do you have 
we take several at home 
i- i take um skiing magazine 
and i take uh discover magazine and also uh cd and stereo review and national geographic i think and boys life 
uh-huh 
oh 
that 's a oh good 
that 's a good one i 'd like to get 
um so i take it that you like to ski 
do you u- do you um receive a lot of information on skiing through the skiing magazine 
i presume that i do 
uh-huh 
uh i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because i do get things from ski associations and things uh at during the year 
oh 
oh uh and do you receive discounts and things like that 
do you think 
or 
uh not so much that i uh more likely to see those at a ski show or something 
but um i just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and and new equipment that 's come out and so forth 
oh 
some fashions are always in there too 
oh 
um-hum 
so with this vacation you 're taking 
did you receive the information from your skiing magazine 
probably not 
uh we already knew we wanted to take one 
and we just started looking around 
i may have referred to a couple of them 
but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information and picked up a lot of brochures and just decided to go to crested butte 
oh 
oh 
we had n't been there before 
hm um that sounds nice 
it 's kind of away from the crowd that 's why we chose that one 
uh-huh 
it 's supposedly low lift lines 
oh 
but i have n't skied utah yet 
but i want to 
huh that 's oh well you need to come out 
like to go to sundance and park city and some of those 
uh-huh 
i understand deer valley is nice too 
deer valley 
uh-huh 
yeah 
they are 
it 's wonderful snow 
well how about you 
what what magazines do you have at home 
uh i am currently taking decorative woodworking and uh country living 
and let 's see we do have national geographic 
and then we have some church magazines 
but i really enjoy the decorative woodworking 
i 'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that 
so the decorative woodworking has just been a great great help 
oh okay 
does it have uh articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
they do have uh mostly they have the the ads on the equipment 
but the whole magazine is just filled with uh pictures and projects that you can make yourself 
and then it has all of the patterns and the instructions that you would need to make a wood project and and then how to paint it with the tole paintings 
and so it 's really a fun one 
i like that 
well that 's good 
it 's good to get use out of one 
uh-huh 
i 'm not sure that um in the case of national geographic 
i mean i read it 
but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time 
um-hum 
but then eventually there 'll be a school project or something where my son -ll need to refer back through forty eight back issues to find you know france or something or whatever it is he 's looking for 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yes 
i 've i 've noticed that too 
but they have been nice to have around 
every once in a while they come in handy 
i used to take smithsonian too 
hm oh 
and i liked that magazine but it was i was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it 
uh-huh 
oh 
you get so many coming in 
and by the time the next round comes in i 'm still not through reading the first round 
oh that 
uh because oh scientific american comes to our house too i forgot 
that 's mostly my son 's 
oh 
but he but i do read it too 
uh-huh 
hm well that sounds 
and so and he takes games magazines too games magazine which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve you know crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that and he likes t- to try that 
uh-huh 
oh 
um-hum 
and so he does but does get to be a lot of paper though 
after a while if you do n't keep them weeded out they almost take over 
uh-huh 
they do they can do that 
i found that they 've been fun for my little girls 
they 're five and four years old 
and they like to go through 
and 
oh yeah 
they 're just kind of getting started now 
uh-huh they like to cut the pictures out and paste them on 
and so we 've found good use for those 
with there mine is a senior in high school 
so he 's we 're kind of at the end of that trail 
oh 
you 're just sort of beginning to think about first grade 
oh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
it 's fun 
well i do have a boy in junior high too 
so so we 're kind of running the gamut 
oh okay 
so you 've got a little bit of a gap there between the little ones 
yeah but they do it 
-kay bill um 
as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you 're working with now 
who do you work with this time 
well i own a company 
you own the company 
alright 
i 'm the president and ceo of the company 
my goodness 
so uh i guess uh i determine what the benefits are 
yeah 
i guess you do 
but uh y- so what are you asking me 
what what benefits i think are most important 
hum well what what do you think of the 
let 's put it this way 
what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than other than their present salary 
um i 'd say in today 's economy uh besides basic benefits uh such as um health insurance and life insurance and the uh some type of retirement plan i 'd say that uh most of the employees uh um that we have really like a a profit sharing plan 
um-hum 
a profit sharing plan 
that 's interesting 
um-hum 
they like to participate in the profits of the company like they 're p- like you know 
because they feel like well we 're contributing to it 
so we 'd like to participate in it 
and so that means i make a little bit less 
but the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in in it working 
yes 
because they they have a specific reason to do so because they themselves benefit from doing a better job 
right 
i think most people uh do n't want money um 
it 's been my experience most people want uh to feel like they 're participating in something that uh that is not a drudgery you know that they ca- enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of 
um-hum 
and it 's a contribution 
right 
well bill uh that idea fits me exactly 
i just retired from uh the university here 
and that 's been the goal of my life was to contribute and u- to the work that i was doing in my research 
and that 's what made me happy 
and uh that 's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for 
and i 'm sure a lot of them do n't 
you can n't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you 're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth 
yeah 
well uh our people get a lot of satisfaction 
um we 're a financial planning firm 
you 're a financial planning firm 
uh yes 
how many uh 
so you said you retired 
i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning 
but anyway uh uh we do we deal with a lot of people that are uh retired or trying to retire and uh it 's real important uh that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that where they were that uh um that it take care of them 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
oh 
they do n't 
none of them really want to be rich 
but they like to have enough to be comfortable 
well what what changes would you ha- have you considered uh in in doing it to you- to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better 
well um we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a a salary is uh is tie um uh a percentage um of business that uh that a person would participate and bring into the company uh pay them uh based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary 
and the re- 
when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to to come in and uh ask for your support 
no 
not necessarily 
um it can be in house people who help you handle x amount of dollars 
oh okay 
um-hum 
even though they did n't bring it in they help it once it 's there 
right 
well see we have diff- we have marketing people 
yeah 
and then we have uh financial planners 
and uh then we have uh staff secretaries and administrative assistants 
and these secretaries and administrative assistants um you know th- if we do n't have their cooperation and they 're not participating in the profit of the company they they can get very dissatisfied very quickly 
um-hum 
and so uh we 're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle 
so administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business 
and uh 
yes 
but it it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job 
but it might be whether the lo- locality there those people want that kind of support 
well and an- and but to 
see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they 're the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with uh it encourages them not to uh complain when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
see we do n't want anybody around here that says make me do it 
i do n't think anybo- any i think most people want to be lack a better termi- terminology they want to be self employed 
yeah 
but they do n't want to take the risk 
in other words they like to control their own future 
but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please without some real strict adherence 
that 's true 
which 
that 's what we have 
um-hum 
favorite type of music or musician or any 
i do n't really have a favorite type 
i like uh a lot of different types of music 
do you 
yeah 
i have a a tape collection that i like to listen to uh cassette tapes but it 's pretty varied 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
how about you 
oh i i 'm very uh i 'm very varied as well 
i uh i do n't think i 've ever met a type of music i do n't like except for uh maybe you know heavy metal and that 
that 's exactly me 
the acid rock or the heavy metal 
yeah 
even some of that i like okay but not mostly as a general rule 
yeah 
i do n't care for that at all 
yeah 
i do n't enjoy rap too much either 
that that does n't appeal to uh uh my ears 
well as far as the rap goes i think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves and i like some of their songs 
uh-huh 
huh 
oh 
but as as 
i agree as a general rule i- i would n't choose rap either 
um-hum 
but i- i like to listen to uh what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz uh classical um 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i- i li- 
i like uh like i said pretty varied uh music 
uh-huh 
i have a couple that my husband really hates when i listen to them like uh billy holiday 
oh 
i really love to listen to her and uh i even have a a tape of lady smith blackman bazo and well i mean they 're very harmonic they really are 
uh-huh 
oh gosh 
uh-huh uh-huh 
yeah 
sure 
so they 're interesting to listen to 
you might try that 
how about you 
uh well um i- i listen to uh specific 
mo- most most likely i would be listen to uh jazz or classical music 
um i in college i took uh a four years of classical guitar 
and i played in the in the jazz combo all four years 
i played guitar for the jazz combo 
oh yeah 
so uh that 's where my two my two listening enjoyments are 
b- but you know jazz can get on my nerves after a while 
uh you can n't just listen to it you know to uh especially a lot of the deeper stuff 
you just can n't listen to it for enjoyment unless you 're yeah unless unless you 're playing it 
it it 's too um uh 
you have to concentrate on it it seems 
just it just does n't do anything 
what about the blues or something like that 
uh uh blues are okay 
i- i tell you i do like um 
i grew up on blue grass music 
my dad is a big blue grass fan 
and so um i would n't have admitted it when i was in high school 
uh-huh 
but i- i i really do like it a lot 
so 
i- i like some of it um 
as far as like the cou- what they now call country western it does n't sound like the old country music at all does it 
i no 
it does n't 
it does n't 
um some of it sounds more like pop music 
yeah 
uh they 've all got you know the real screechy electric guitars now 
oh nah 
i do n't care for that if if i 'm going to listen to today 's country western i have tapes of like randy travis and clint black 
and yeah 
and i even liked jim reeves you know and or uh what what meryl haggard and faron young that type of country western music is what what i like to listen to 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i- i 
g- yeah 
i grew up on him uh-huh 
uh-huh 
sure 
asleep at the wheel uh sons of the pioneers you know stuff like that 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
um and i like sound tracks a lot 
oh do you 
yeah 
i- it seems like you get a lot of original music that way 
yeah 
you sure do 
i mean you know think about like the twin peaks and stuff like that that 's just real recent uh things like that i like to listen to 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
um i like instrumental things 
um-hum 
um i have some spiro gyro tapes 
oh they 're great are n't they 
oh they 're wonderful 
yeah 
i love them 
i have some dulcimer music 
i mean like i said that that 's pretty varied 
yeah 
it sure is 
yeah 
uh al jarreau he 's somebody i like 
he 's pretty kind of jazz inspired but but still kind of pop too 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i like his 
he has a nice smooth voice 
oh yeah 
and you know what i like the most about him is i 've gone to see him in concert and he always he looks like he 's having fun 
yeah 
sure 
i mean some people sing 
and they have their faces all contorted like it hurts them or something 
but he looks like he 's having a good time 
i mean he 's up there moving around and smiling like he 's happy and and like all he wants to do is is make the audience enjoy it too 
uh-huh 
sure 
and he he 's real fun to listen to 
uh-huh 
um bonnie rait i like her a lot 
um-hum 
um in fact when ever she won her big grammy i think there was like five of them or something was was it five 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
or 
yeah 
something like that 
it was last last uh last year was n't it 
si- yeah 
last year or the year before i can n't remember 
but um i was listening to a particular radio station 
and and the one dj said who the heck is bonnie rait and why does she deserve five grammies 
and i vowed then that i was not going to listen to that radio station any more if that dj could make such an unedu- 
okay 
what do do you do artistic painting 
um i do tole painting 
oh you do 
uh-huh 
i really love the tole painting 
um i have n't done any of the oil or watercolor 
i would like to learn that some day 
but right now my passion is tole painting 
do you do a lot of it 
uh-huh 
yeah i i took one class about i guess three or four years ago 
and i 've done a little um 
oh 
but it takes a lot of time 
it does 
it is real time consuming 
and 
d- do you sell your projects 
uh mostly i have just given them away as gifts 
uh-huh 
um i 've done uh perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and oh on and on you know just things like that 
but um i would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job 
um-hum 
where do you work at 
i just work at stop and shop out there in in ogden 
so 
oh now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique 
no 
i 've wanted to do that uh but just have n't just have n't mass produced enough to do that 
uh-huh 
so i have five children of my own 
so it 's they they keep me busy 
that keeps you busy 
and tole painting 's just a you know something i do in my spare time 
so 
uh-huh 
have you tried any of the 
well do you cut out your own projects 
yes 
uh-huh 
i have my own saws 
and so i really enjoy doing that 
huh do you um ever spray your projects with uh i mean a base coat first 
or do you brush it all on 
i brush it on 
yeah 
i have n't tried a a spray varnish 
i use just a wood sealer 
uh-huh 
and 
i just bought a spray gun one of those airless um not airless high volume low pressure spray guns 
oh uh-huh 
and i do a lot of wood working 
and that 's what i bought it for 
do you 
oh 
but i have n't used it yet 
oh well that 's that probably give you a smoother finish would n't it 
yeah 
oh 
yeah 
now what type of wood working do you do 
um fine furniture 
oh do you 
type stuff yeah 
that 's why i brought bought the sprayer is to finish my projects 
oh 
that 's my worst worst part of my wood working 
i get so sick of making 
oh but it 's hard to finish it huh 
it yeah 
but spraying does put on a nicer finish 
oh well that is interesting 
so what kind of equipment do you have 
for 
uh-huh 
wood working 
um let me see 
table saw scroll saw band saw lathe routers 
and that 's about it 
boy it sounds like you 're really into it 
that is nice 
yeah 
it is 
yeah 
i i just have a scroll saw and a jig saw 
and i am really anxious to get a band saw and a router 
yeah 
the band saw 's really nice 
i have an inca 
i do n't know if you 've ever heard of those 
oh 
but yeah it 's nice to have the right equipment 
yeah 
that is that makes it easier does n't it 
um-hum 
well have you sold any of your furniture 
or just 
um not 
mostly i do like you do give it away as gifts 
uh-huh 
uh making my own furniture 
oh 
w- oh well that 's interesting 
do you uh did you take classes to learn how to do that 
um just in junior high and then i just kept on through high school and then bought my own equipment kept up with that 
uh-huh 
oh so yours is mostly just a hobby too then 
yeah 
oh 
yeah 
well that 's interesting 
oh i would i really would love to go take a class in wood working and learn how to 
i do n't know if i necessarily want to do furniture 
but mostly uh just do more 
like the shelves and 
uh-huh 
the 
for your tole painting 
wood working 
uh 
yeah 
yeah 
so it 's fun 
good 
well i guess i 'll let you go now 
well they come on 
we 're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us 
oh they do 
oh okay 
so this is my first one 
you 're probably a veteran at this 
yeah 
well it 's it has been really fun 
i 've enjoyed this um 
like i say i 've made a couple of calls to texas and just talked to all different kinds of people 
uh-huh 
so i think you 'll enjoy doing it 
yeah 
it 's fun 
sounds fun 
where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here 
um you know there 's a shop in roy that i really love 
um and it 's there by the copper mill restaurant used to be the hayloft 
oh i 'm not famil- 
well we live in roy 
but we have n't 
is it on nineteen hundred 
uh-huh 
um let 's see 
i 'm trying to think of the name 
i know where fifty six hundred south is 
uh i do n't not right off 
is that ben franklin then 
ben franklin 
okay 
so how do you feel about the vietnam war 
well um you know i guess that it 's pretty deep feelings uh 
i just uh went back and rented uh the movie what is it good morning vietnam and uh 
um-hum 
yeah 
i saw that as well 
got that uh uh some insight there to to kind of help me put together the feelings 
i really appreciated the the little uh english class where the uh the uh fellow just would n't do a- you know 
the guy 's goug- gouging your eyes out 
what are you going to do 
um-hum 
you know wait for him to finish me off 
and uh it it was uh good to remember the uh that that kind of uh asian philosophy that uh 
um-hum 
well uh were you over in vietnam 
or 
no 
no 
i was kind of an in between uh finally drew a high draft number 
and you 
i 'm i was much too young 
i was born in sixty seven 
so 
oh 
um in a way both my well uh both my brothers were um draft age 
but neither of them wound up going over which i think they were very happy for 
well i personally uh you know uh i just went in limbo 
i had a passport and was ready to go or um uh out of the country or or join special forces either one 
uh um-hum 
yeah 
um-hum 
i mean i i- just did n't know 
so uh 
well um so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there 
um yeah 
just a second 
or okay 
okay 
sure 
now well mark um what was that again 
um do you think i mean do you think our invest- the investment in lives and money was worth it 
no 
not not really 
i totally agree with that um 
um 
well what what effects do you think it 's had in our country 
downside um uh well 
robert blythe says we should uh uh yeah go into the grief that that 's there 
and we 're our presidents have always avoided that as a country 
um-hum 
so it 's pretty serious really uh a 
lot of things that are n't being addressed 
um-hum 
um-hum well i think i think that you know that 's pretty typical of the of the entire entire involvement over in that you know that nothing was really addressed 
it wa- it was n't you know it was never 
we we announced that we were going to war 
it was it was such a gradual and subtle you know the um you know increasement of of force that 
yeah 
gulf of tonkin uh resolution 
and was it a dolphin or a torpedo 
things you remember that 
um-hum i v- vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something 
yeah 
yeah 
only only it was foggy 
and pre- uh p- finally president johnson said well th- they were n't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo 
or -thing like that oh 
is n't that something 
well um-hum um 
so um do you do you do you think that like our um for example like in in th- this past war the persian gulf war that uh that you see it seemed to me that that bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to um you know prepare the country for war 
um-hum 
okay hey mark uh i 've got to go um 
yeah 
okay 
we 'll um see you 
i guess our five minutes are up according to me 
are they to you 
uh i was n't really keeping c- count 
but i guess 
that 's good-bye 
yeah 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye 
so um do you have a pc 
yes 
i have a macintosh se thirty 
um-hum 
yeah 
one of my friends are into macintoshes 
i have a um pc my a ibm pc myself 
um-hum 
a two eighty six 
but i 'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty six um 
what do you use yours for mostly 
um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal 
uh-huh 
uh but i 'm um i think eventually i 'll start using it for spread sheets and things like that 
um what do you find that you use yours mostly for 
well i do a lot of word processing and spread sheets and data base 
and uh about the only thing 
i am uh i 'm just starting to get in into uh a little bit more communications now 
i 've just uh today ordered a fax modem 
so i 'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using you know 
um-hum 
you do n't have to make a hard copy that way 
um-hum 
uh are you using windows 
no 
i i think i i 'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty six before i move up to windows although you know i do like the the graphical user environment 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
well it 's getting to be more and more like a macintosh 
yeah 
yeah it 's ju- um 
i want it i want it you know well i ju- i just want it more for multitasking which i suppose is also like a macintosh 
um-hum 
um 
well the one thing i used to use a 
i 've never used an ibm actually 
i used to use a just an apple two e which of course is looks pretty primitive now 
um-hum 
yeah 
i use- that 's what i learned a lot of languages on was an apple two e in my high school 
but i do n't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh mac right now 
um-hum 
i do n't have uh any compilers so i 'm uh 
um-hum 
well do you use your computer for uh just things around the house or in the 
wa- i use it in my business 
in the i see what do you do 
i uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh english as a second language programs 
oh wow 
um and uh are these like uh do these programs um 
are they are they based on on a on a um other language 
or are they based are are they based 
like a lot of the um i know a lot of the the english as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world 
and the teacher just tries to tries to teach english you know through natural understanding 
that 's uh exactly what yeah that 's the kind of thing i 'm working with exactly 
um-hum 
you seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that 
well it was just uh when i was in high school i worked for the community school 
and they had a english second language class 
and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know spoke english not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time 
um-hum 
imagine it 's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you do n't have as many cues 
you can n't do n't have hand gestures and things like that 
right 
well now we uh 
what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though 
um-hum 
most of the stuff that i do is not uh interactive and then i use it for te- uh data analysis on testing 
um-hum 
so 
oh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that 
well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh 
um-hum 
you know when you when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones are n't find out how reliable the test is 
um-hum 
um-hum 
you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort 
so it 's involves a lot of spread sheet use 
yeah 
i 'd imagine so 
um so um what were you doing when you were using an apple two e 
well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and with smaller files 
i can n't believe you know i 've got uh five uh megabytes on this one now and on my two e i had a hundred twenty eight k 
um-hum 
it it 's 
ama- yes 
it it 's amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much 
i remember my first computer was a trs eighty with four k on it and you know and then then i mo- and then i started playing with apples you know 
yeah 
and and those had forty eight 
or you know if if they were really great they had sixty four k 
oh the old the old apple uh the the the original apple had what yeah forty eight i guess did n't it 
you know uh all i know i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen k on them is all 
and there 's i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty eight k 
my goodness 
and there was only one computer that had forty eight k on it at the time 
uh-huh 
and you know it 's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you 
i 'm not sure a- about um macintoshes 
but i know in ibm 's you you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time 
um-hum 
you know that 's that 's your low that 's the low end um 
well the se thirty goes up to eight but i have n't upgraded it quite that far yet 
um-hum 
i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk 
i do n't know 
they say that system seven uses a lot of memory 
um-hum 
yeah 
imagine just to support 
okay 
so you have eight children 
um what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together 
oh we spend a lot of time out doors jogging bicycling uh going to the park um some time watching vcr movies um generally cheap things 
um-hum 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
yeah 
we know how that goes 
uh with lots of kids you do n't have lots of money for recreation 
that 's right 
well that 's fun 
so um let 's see uh 
some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot 
and uh you may think this is funny 
but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek 
and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it 's dark in our house 
yeah 
and that is so fun 
the kids just get a crack out of that 
um we like we do like to go to the park too you like your family 
um we do n't do a lot of vacationing 
have you taken a lot of vacations together 
or 
most of our vacations are to go and see grandma and grandpa 
uh-huh 
and whe- 
we get an occasional one or two day thing but most of them are going and seeing grandma and grandpa 
oh 
oh now where do they live 
in arizona 
oh so that 's a bit of a drive for you then 
yes 
oh so you like to go there for the holidays 
and 
oh we do n't go very often for holidays 
generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays and let grandma and grandpa come and visit us 
um-hum 
oh uh-huh 
uh what are the ages of your kids then 
they range from twenty four to five 
oh yeah 
so you have some in the nest and some out huh 
that 's right 
how old are your children 
we have 
ours start at twelve 
and then they go down to four 
i think the hardest thing for us has been is to find ac- you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have you know 
so i bet 
yeah 
like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing but the young kids do n't understand it and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that 
um-hum 
yes 
uh-huh 
and 
yes 
and then if you want to play something on the little kids level then the older kids get real bored 
and and they want to and do something else 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
i can i can relate to that 
um do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one 
i think it 's improving actually 
uh-huh 
we had an interesting experience the other day 
we we have a pretty much a a routine that we spend 
we do n't have our kids play with other kids on sunday and we just kind of keep them at home and our next door neighbor uh 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
we were at a soccer game saturday 
and our next door neighbor was there 
somebody came up and asked if if their daughter could spend saturday night at their house and she said no sundays our family day and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them 
um-hum 
um-hum 
that 's good 
and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now 
oh good 
i think it 's gone to one extreme where the families were just all running every different direction and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now 
um-hum 
i think so 
and i feel like you know like president bush bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation 
and it does begin with the families at home and so i i 'm a firm believer in that too 
yeah 
i think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they 've got to start doing something 
so 
um yes 
that 's that 's true 
well we see that a lot out here in utah 
and um so hopefully hopefully it 's going to spread huh 
utah 's a lot better than texas 
that 's a good oh 
um do you have a lot of large families out there in texas 
or 
yeah very few 
very few 
you feel like you 're in the minority 
yeah oh definitely 
when we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we did n't have good sense 
oh dear 
but uh 
oh well out here in utah five is about the the average 
average 
yeah 
yeah my wife and i were in utah until i guess we were about twenty four 
oh 
uh-huh 
and we 've never been back since then 
but we have kids up there now 
oh 
so we get up occasionally 
oh 
oh i have some relatives out there in texas 
in fact my mom 's out there in texas right now in dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch 
and 
where where in dallas 
well uh no 
i 'm trying aberdeen 
hum 
it is that close to dallas 
i do n't have any idea 
i 've never heard of it 
oh 
must be a little town 
do n't you 
it 's i gue- guess it 's out there clear out 
they have a ranch it has like five hundred acres 
and 
yeah 
okay um chuck do you have any pets there at your home 
yeah i do 
and what kind do you have 
i 've got a male siamese about a year old here 
i live alone in an apartment and uh except for the cat 
oh uh-huh 
uh-huh 
how about you 
well we have a cat um 
he 's probably oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby 
uh-huh 
oh uh how 's the disposition of your siamese cat 
well it 's uh you know they 're just uh aggressive by nature and uh he 's been neutered and declawed 
uh-huh 
so and he 's an indoor cat 
uh-huh 
so uh uh that kind of calms him down for the most part 
and uh how about yours 
well yeah 
he 's uh he has been really aggressive at especially towards my little girl for some reason 
huh 
he 's uh been so mean to her 
and and you say you had him how long 
and we 've had him for about two years and and he was so mean to her um right after we first got him 
two years 
so we had him neutered and and declawed 
and now he bites her 
he can n't scratch her anymore 
huh 
he bites her 
does he bite her enough to draw blood 
yeah 
yeah 
he has a couple of times 
so 
uh-huh 
but he 's a very possessive cat 
he he loves my son 
it 's his cat 
and he 's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him and he 's so funny 
yeah 
he just follows my son around just like a dog 
huh 
he wo n't even let my son shower 
yeah 
he meows and wants to get in the bathroom 
and while he showers it 's so hilarious 
so he 's quite a animal 
yeah 
boy 
i guess 
well as long as he does n't get too aggressive i guess with the daughter he 's all right 
yeah 
you would n't want him to carry her off or something 
yeah 
well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because we just could n't have him being so so aggressive towards the girl 
uh-huh 
sure 
but uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit 
and we do keep our daughter away from him 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house 
is that the only pet that you have 
it is 
uh-huh 
we 've we tried a dog um about four years ago and we ended up with a oh malamute and some other kind of mix 
anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home 
so we gave him up and tried 
well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh 
yes 
uh-huh 
we 're in a house 
but we 're in a subdivision where we really can n't allow the dog 
yeah i see 
we could n't allow him to run free 
so he was just chained up all the time 
and it was it was unfortunate 
sure 
so have you tried any other pets 
no 
no 
i- i live alone in an apartment 
and uh it 's it 's not that big that uh although i 've heard rabbits are pretty good you know i- i saw something on cnn or on cable here uh a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses 
oh 
oh 
uh-huh 
oh my word 
and they apparently uh 
especially when they 're young when they bring them in uh 
oh my word 
and do they they just paper train it or something 
i guess 
i guess 
yeah 
and i would imagine that they do n't have many more than one to start with either 
yeah 
well rabbits are darling 
that would be fun if you could get them trained 
otherwise they 're pretty smelly 
because uh yeah yep 
that 's right 
um 
did you see the the cnn the the dog show uh 
huh-uh 
we do n't have c- we do n't have cable 
they i see 
well they have uh uh a westmin- they call it the westminster dog show uh 
uh i think it 's in new york city at the at the gardens 
there once a year live and they had that on last week 
oh 
and that 's really kind of something to watch uh 
oh 
it 's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two and uh some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see on there 
is that right 
oh 
some of them are really beautiful too 
uh uh-huh 
yeah so 
well that would be interesting to watch 
yeah so you live in utah do you 
yes 
uh-huh 
elton 
goodness 
we live out here by it 's by ogden 
it 's north of salt lake city utah and we really love it out here 
uh-huh 
it 's uh kind of country 
we 're we 're only about ten minutes from ogden 
uh-huh 
so we 're kind of country but not too 
well do you all work for ti or or 
not no 
huh-uh 
do you 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
oh well see i 'm getting so many calls to texas 
this is the very first one i 've i 've talked to 
oh well great 
yeah 
i 've been doing it for about two weeks 
and uh no my 
you know uh-huh 
well uh i do n't know 
i think the budget is really out of hand right now 
and especially in this election year i think that uh there ought to be so- at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this 
um-hum 
yeah 
see it like seems to me you know that everyone 's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it 's when it 's just such a bad time for it 
right 
right 
and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts 
uh especially what for instance george bush is offering 
you 
know no it the ninety seven cents a week 
yeah 
ninety seven cents a week 
now what 
that 's really not going to do a lot of good it does n't seem to me to your average middle income person you know 
uh-huh 
another ninety seven cents 
hell you can buy a coke or something for that 
hell 
i mean mostly you know it 's it 's not actually a a a cut 
it 's just a cut in the with hold in the amount with held you know 
yeah 
um yeah 
i do n't just do n't see it changing my life style a whole lot 
nah that ninety seven cents really is n't going to do it for me either 
um-hum 
uh i i have n't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that has made a lot of sense to me either 
especially the democratic candidates uh do n't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point 
um-hum 
yeah 
i mean you know in in retrospect um was it was it mondale or dukakis that said you know i 'll i 'll tell you right now i 'm going to raise taxes 
i believe it was dukakis but i i can n't 
it was dukakis 
yeah 
i have a lot of respect for him 
yeah 
i mean that 's better than george bush who came out and said no 
i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can n't follow through on this 
yeah 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but it seems to me that uh that the budget is so out of hand 
and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over 
and we 're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of x number of billion trillion dollars a year 
um-hum 
well i 'd really like to know whe- where that money is actually going to go 
because in my opinion i do n't think i 'm ever going to see any of this peace so called peace dividend 
oh yeah 
i 
know it it 's 
i mean if they could actually pu- put something together and make 
i 'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because i feel that they waste money also 
um-hum 
but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever 
um-hum 
oh yeah 
i i yeah i i think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where 
right 
ex- exactly and in that way we could really focus on building the infra- structure of the country 
it wou- it wou- it would help unemployment greatly 
and it 
yeah 
our infrastructure is in is in 
i mean we we 've we 've hurt ourselves incredibly over the last fi- fifty years of the cold war 
yeah 
and and there 's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we 're in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infrastructure 
and i surely do n't hear anybody saying that right now 
yeah 
um-hum um-hum um yeah 
i i agree totally 
um i mean we this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen 
um i i 'm in college right now 
and 
so am i 
oh really 
where do you go 
uh iu 
right 
i go to georgia tech um 
uh-huh 
and in 
my 
i had poli- you know the required political science class a couple of years ago 
um-hum 
and one of the things we discussed was you know were where the budget situa- how how the budget situation just got so out of hand 
right 
and essentially what happened was 
and i think it was like in eigh- in the um tax year of eighty one um 
ronald reagan basically said you know i 'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um that the congress would not in the right mind pass and con- congress realizing that they were going to lose a the democratic congress realizing that they were going to lose a propaganda war you know by by you know sli- by by removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know wha- created the the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit 
right 
uh-huh 
right 
and you just 
you you just have to wonder what they 're thinking in washington 
i mean it 's just i mean it 's just like you know playing chicken with a loaded gun 
yeah 
uh well it 's it 's more than a loaded 
it 's a loaded cannon 
i mean they 've got trillions of dollars to spend every year 
yeah 
and they in my opinion do n't do a very responsible job of spending that money 
um-hum 
well yeah 
and what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well i 'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we 're going to have you know we 're we 're going to we 're going to have to do some unpopular things i mean he would n't have a chance of getting elected 
oh no uh-huh 
i mean it 's kind of like rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where where people just want want to have you know what ever will make them feel good right now you know 
for the for the moment 
and that 's what really is getting me about what george bush 's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you 'll be happy come november and you 'll elect me again and then i 'm going to go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it does n't seem that it 's going to make much of a difference 
and 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah that i mean i do n't know 
i i i do n't i do n't think george bush will make the american people happy with ninety seven cents a week 
no 
no 
not at all 
well i just do n't think it was a well thought out incentive 
no 
so martin how do you feel about crime in the city 
uh you said you 're from atlanta 
right 
i- i- i actually i live in the city and uh i guess it is a concern of mine uh you know for my own safety 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i mean do you f- do you find crime in atlanta really bad i mean 
i live in atlanta also 
oh that 's right 
um uh i think it is bad in certain areas 
uh-huh 
however i think uh the area that i live in it 's not uh the the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city 
um-hum 
i think it seems that there 's ce- certain areas where uh the crime is focused um 
um-hum 
well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city 
well i think it 's what 's been happening over the last several years it seems they 've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility 
and uh it had some impact but not a tremendous amount 
um-hum 
and probably um they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think 's 
i 'd probably agree with that 
the best way there is yeah 
uh 
you know uh particularly in some of the housing projects uh you know that 's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused and they 've got to do more than just having having cops there 
um-hum 
they 've got to kind of change the way people think about it 
yeah 
that 's probably true 
um so d- um well do you think atlanta is as bad as most other cities 
um well i 've been to 
i 'd say it 's it 's probably in the top top ten in terms of crime 
um it 's nowhere near as bad as new york city for example 
um-hum 
probably not not as bad as detroit 
um-hum 
i do n't think it 's as bad as la either 
no 
we i do n't think we do n't we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have 
yeah 
that seems to be true 
um yeah 
if you 've ever been to like new york city 
and you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed 
um-hum 
um-hum 
it 's that obvious 
yeah 
i know 
i 've i 've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where where there 's a lot of crime a lot of that 's going to just just keeping your senses about you and you kn- trying not to look like a victim you know 
yeah 
that 's true 
you know walk wi- you know walk with you know with well not silly just walk you know confidently 
with a big stick 
or 
and you know do n't do n't be looking around like you 've never been there before and you have no idea where you are 
right 
sure 
right 
do n't do n't walk down a an alley 
or do n't get just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation but yeah 
yeah um-hum um-hum yeah 
and 
there are times when you can n't avoid all that um and and then you 're kind of on your own 
if 
you have you ever have you ever been mugged in atlanta 
uh no 
the only thing i 've ever had is i 've had my wallet lifted but that was in a more of a a a setting where there was a number of people around 
um-hum 
and i kind of got 
i was much younger at the time and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off so i did n't know who had it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i 've had that happen 
but that 's that 's about it 
yeah 
i 've been pretty lucky about getting mugged 
i do n't yeah 
oh yeah 
i think i 've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun and that 's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that i 've seen in atlanta 
hum 
really 
well i 've had my 
and that and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed 
um-hum 
i 've had my car stolen 
so maybe that counts 
oh really 
yeah 
wow where was where where was that 
was that downtown 
or 
oh no 
that was in the northern pa- um up near cumberland mall area 
really 
it 's actually cobb county 
but it is atlanta and uh there 's a lot of car thefts in that area 
um-hum metropolitan 
yeah 
yeah 
i 've i 've actually i 've known known some people that have had their cars stolen 
um and uh and uh you know but half the time they seem to the apd seems to recover them you know in in various states of disrepair 
right 
yeah 
up on blocks you know 
my friend who had a um vw rabbit 
and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in in his front seat 
yeah 
yeah mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage 
but they did n't they did n't strip it so i got it back 
um-hum 
well you 're probably luckier than 
yeah 
than most 
um-hum 
um so does like insurance pay for the body damage 
or was that was that all it was body 
right 
it it was about three grand to put everything together 
they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car 
yeah 
you 've got to you crack the steering column 
then you pull the 
there 's a pin in there that you can pull on these gm cars and you can st- start it up basically pretty easily 
oh um-hum 
um-hum 
so how do you know this much about um stealing cars 
well after i found mine i had to i had this 
oh how 's your products been 
um i really have n't had uh too many problems 
uh seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out 
i hear that one 
have you had any lately go out 
yeah 
i 've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave all three 
and they 
unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time when i bought my new house 
and uh i really do n't have any recourse 
so i had to call and have them all repaired and that 
oh wow 
yeah 
it was a hassle 
so you did n't get anything 
even all the all the warranties were out 
yeah 
the warranty on the refrigerator uh 
the i- 
the refrigerator warranty 's still good 
but the ice maker itself lasted three years 
and it was three years and two months 
you 're kidding 
no 
yeah 
we just moved into a new house too 
so we had to buy all those too 
uh watch out 
yeah 
the only thing i 've had problems with is um 
i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail and i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it 's nontoxic and such 
um-hum 
and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings 
so 
hm 
i did n't return it because it 'd probably cost me more than 
i just ended up using it 
but that 's about the only thing i 've had gone wrong 
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances 
but i just uh 
it was within two days that all three of these stopped working 
and the the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump 
that 's incredib- 
and the uh microwave had to have uh some kind of something i can n't even pronounce 
and they uh 
the dryer had to have a new heating element 
so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them 
and they all went out at the same time 
uh within two days of each other 
or two days 
wow 
i was 
it was n't a good week 
i was pretty mad 
and plus the place that i 'd bought um them all had gone out of business 
so even if uh i think even if i had uh had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that that manufactured 
but still they were through that retailer 
so i do n't know if i could 've taken it to another retailer or not 
wow 
that 's frustrating 
but i did n't have to worry about all that because they were n't under warranty 
so it was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all 
uh-huh 
but i 
the only other things that i 've ever had trouble with um 
i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers 
uh-huh 
they go out a lot 
yeah 
i 've had two or three of those go out 
one was under warranty 
and the other two were n't 
but i just 
other than that you know tvs and things like that i have n't ever had any trouble with 
i do n't think products are getting much better though 
yeah 
see i 'm in the manufacturing field i -ust 
home from work 
and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags 
oh really 
yeah 
that 's interesting 
at morton international 
and i thin- 
well it 's it 's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment 
we test everything after each assembly process 
and so our testing is pretty thorough 
but 
do you do you test each individual one or do you just test 
um 
like if you 've got ten you test one 
and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay 
um the tests that 
well we test every one electrically 
we do n't 
i think they test um four or five a day actually exploding the air bag and but we do test after during the assembly proj- product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it 's there after we install it 
um-hum 
so each assembly process has an inspection right after it 's done 
and then we do electrical tests on them during the process 
so 
well that 's something i 've never had to use 
it 's never i 've never been involved in an automobile accident 
so luckily that 's a product that i have n't had to test 
yeah 
but i think it 's a great idea 
i 'm i 'm 
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to to come about 
but that 
well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government 
it 's incredible how much testing they have to do 
oh i 'm sure they want to be thorough before they 
but uh even 
you know i do n't mind spending the extra money on the car if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing 
uh-huh 
i 'm not a real big seat belt 
my uh 
okay 
um i guess we 're going to talk describe uh job benefits 
and so what do you think uh next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits 
uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh covering medical costs for yourself or family members 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
well um does your company have good benefits in that in that regard 
yeah 
i thin- 
i work for a a public school system district and uh so it 's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing 
uh-huh 
where the school district does um the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of uh costs 
oh yeah 
but i- overall um i 've been pleased with it over the years 
um-hum 
i think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies 
or now we 're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any 
hm 
i see 
how about yourself 
uh well i 'm 
my medical coverage is with an hmo um so that 's in my opinion that 's gett- that 's bordering on a health clinic 
uh-huh 
but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage 
right 
yeah 
um 
our district did that for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years 
and i was in the hmo 
and um i- i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh 
they usually sign a contract or something and um uh i did have surgery last summer 
um-hum 
and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day 
and i 've never seen another bill 
so i- i have to say it really works 
right 
but again i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it 
uh if you 've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for you know those people 
yes 
that 's right 
yeah 
i 'm i 'm fairly young myself 
i 've only been 
when i first started working which 
three years ago is when i first got into full time employment and uh at that time i immediately joined the hmo 
uh-huh 
and i never really 
so the only doctor i i 've kind of consistently had has been through the hmo 
and uh you know for me it 's worked out real good 
yeah 
right 
but if you you know have a family and and um everybody 's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history 
and you feel comfortable with it 
um-hum 
i i 'm sure it would be very stressful 
and my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay 
you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as you know good 
hm 
so uh 
um-hum 
yeah 
um like you you mentioned you work for a school system 
i work for uh georgia tech in the research branch 
oh all right 
and i guess another one that that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a as a benefit 
i do too 
are you talking about like spring break 
and 
right yeah 
right 
getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation 
right 
it it really um 
i do n't think most of our teachers 
now i 'm not a teacher 
i am the a secretarial executive assistant 
but i do n't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly 
um-hum 
it is just texas has really um you know 
they want everybody educated no matter what it 's costs 
uh and it it would be just 
we all look forward to 
like in two weeks we have spring break 
and i do n't know who looks forward to it more the students or the or the teachers and the staff 
um-hum 
right 
what do you do there 
well um i 'm not actually on the teaching faculty 
but we have a large research organization associated with the university 
and that 's who i work with 
okay 
um and we 're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do 
we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study 
i li- well that 's good 
yeah 
i would think that that type of employment you 're you 're one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little lukewarm or something and and um you know it 's good that they allow you that 
right 
right 
it um 
a- i say the schools 
now we do have to work you know the day 
but we do get many days off 
and um we all look forward to it 
um-hum 
that 's only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college 
but at the time i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh i 've just continued to uh stay there so 
oh yeah 
um-hum 
okay are there are there any things that that you 'd like to see changed in terms of the the benef- 
okay 
martin do you do any exercise 
yes 
i do 
uh i like to uh play basketball and weight lifting 
those are probably the two main things i like to do 
uh-huh 
um so those are more or less indoor sports 
how 's the weather out there in georgia 
yeah 
um in in in the winter you typically it 's it 's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis 
um i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall 
uh-huh 
but in the winter it it 's gets pretty cold 
oh 
um yeah 
so it 's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter 
uh-huh 
um how about yourself 
well yeah 
i 'm on a exercise program 
i 'm riding my aerodyne bike um half an hour every morning 
uh-huh 
and i 'm just about ready to up it to forty five minutes a morning 
and i feel like that 's been a real nice exercise in the winter time 
it 's it 's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise 
um-hum 
right 
do you uh do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise 
no 
huh-uh 
i first of all i 'd like to get my weight off 
i 'm about fifty pounds overweight 
and so i 'd like to get the weight off 
and then i 'd really like to get into that 
um-hum 
and uh we have a my husband and i have a a aerobic video that 's called the firm 
i do n't know if you 've heard of it 
but it 's a an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down 
but you 're using weights 
and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done 
it is r- it 's really fun 
huh 
yes 
it 's it 's it 's aerob- it 's similar to aerobics with weights but it 's like low impact aerobics where you use weights 
yes 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yes 
okay 
are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics 
um no 
i mean yes 
i am 
but i have never done it myself 
have you done that 
uh yes 
i have 
in in atlanta that 's um 
most of the health clubs are all 
oh 
that 's the that 's the in thing 
that 's the big thing huh 
at first it was just regular aerobics 
but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over 
oh 
so how is that 
um it they call it a low impact aerobics 
and it 's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time 
ooh 
and from when i 've done it it does give you a good a real good workout 
but the only thing i 'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees you know that and movement of going up on the step you know that could create a problem 
oh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
they they seem to think that it it wo n't 
but you never know 
huh now if um playing basketball are you knees 
do you have healthy knees 
yeah 
i i think my ankles probably are my lame weak point 
oh dear 
but i 've i 've kind of taken care of that 
i wear high tops and then also an an a support ankle brace which is very stiff and um we- wearing that i have n't had any problems in the past year or so 
uh-huh 
um-hum that 's good 
well that sounds you sound just like my husband 
he he he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball 
yeah 
and oh he 's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy 
yeah 
i 
an- so that 's what he does 
he wears his his brace and his high tops 
and 
um-hum 
yeah 
i did i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy 
oh 
uh oh 
i mean it would only take three or four days 
and i could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to to rehabilitate yourself to play that way 
shoot wow 
uh-huh 
oh dear 
oh 
but um so how how successful is your exercise video 
it is amazing how fast you take off the inches and i would once i start my forty i 'd like to do the forty five minutes a day on the bike for a week 
uh-huh 
and then every other day i 'd like to incorporate the video um and then the bike on the other day 
um 
but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off 
and the muscle builds real fast 
um-hum 
um you can start 
they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month 
and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty five pound dumbbells and then you 're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video 
um-hum 
and it 's a hour long video 
so 
so it 's a good workout 
it is 
yeah 
i really enjoy that 
so i 'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy 
um-hum 
so in the winter i guess there 's a lot uh 
it 's quite cold and and snow 
yes 
yes 
now this one has been quite mild 
um we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground 
it was quite chilly 
but not 
so how do you get most of your current event information 
well duri- see i 'm going to school right now 
and uh while i 'm working i do n't get a i do n't get a chance to read the paper a lot 
uh-huh 
and i do n't watch tv as much really either because uh my free time is kind of 
and i do like to do other stuff with it 
right 
while i 'm at work sometimes i on the computer network um i read the news sometimes 
um-hum 
and that 's kind of helpful 
i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things 
you keep up on what 's going on 
that 's true 
i mean my roommates and stuff you know people around me talk about it 
yeah 
and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff 
so 
right 
well i 'm a housewife 
i have three kids 
and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six oclock and then um talking with people and just hearing what 's going on 
uh-huh 
yeah 
do you watch do you watch the network like major network news 
or do you watch like the mcneil lehrer hour 
but just the regular channel just channel eight 
oh really 
that 's our channel here 
that 's the um eyewitness news 
uh-huh 
so 
oh ch- see channel where i am channel eight 's um like public tv 
so it 's kind of different 
oh uh-huh 
yeah 
i think i think the uh 
i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it 's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on 
but um it seems that um they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news 
right 
and i think even in the elections they choose who they 're going to follow and who they 're not 
and basically you know if a c- candidate can get them to follow then the news will you know kind of publicize his name 
yeah 
yeah 
exactly 
i do n't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it 
i think you get a very lopsided picture of what 's going on 
uh-huh 
uh because they can they can only report on i mean 
they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say you you just can n't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r- and probably read something on it 
right 
right 
and the news too it just does n't um cover a- that many stories 
i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes and you know and and your ca- catastrophes with weather and stuff 
yeah 
but other than that you really do n't know what 's going on 
yeah 
um i will read our current letters that come out on elections 
and i guess i do read that 
and i do study who 's running in our area 
and i do study what 's going on in the economy 
it you know 
and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information 
what kind of uh see 
i subscribe to like science news 
and that 's that 's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what 's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i would n't know about but other than that i do n't really r- 
right 
i do n't i do n't really subscribe to anything else 
i i used to read every month a reader 's digest but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles 
uh-huh 
or if i you know am interested in something of course during the w- when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on 
oh yeah 
but a lot of the times i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper 
but i just can n't seem to find the time 
yeah 
if they 'd put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things 
yeah 
but 
well i remember dur- back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the tv on because that they were going constantly with that stuff 
right 
but uh 
well i um they even did a story on our news here in texas on what people wanted to see more of 
and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of texas news 
you know we just do n't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in dallas that we want to hear what 's going on with the economy what 's being done to help it what 's going on in other countries what 's you know just more information 
yeah 
if they reported every m- if they reported every violent crime in atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour 
yeah 
but uh 
well i guess you 'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics 
oh yeah 
that 's 
they still already they 're having like um 
in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then o- on the olympics you know 
and they 've got like a countdown 
it 's like sixteen hundred days or something 
i know we 're trying to get tickets to it right now 
oh really 
yeah 
that 's going to be crazy that time of year here 
but uh 
yeah 
i can n't believe i mean 
they 're they 're uh stretching out the olympic news for that much coverage over 
i guess people want to hear about it 
also big in big in the news right now is the braves because they 're uh they 're in you know tr- spring training or whatever and they did so well last year 
right 
right 
yeah 
they spent a lot of time that 's another thing they spend a long time on sports 
and i think that um that 's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things 
yeah 
but 
it seems like 
i do n't know 
it 's they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know 
or if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to s- some channel for it 
but i do n't have cable 
i think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you do n't uh convict someone who uh really should n't be convicted 
definitely 
um and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that 
i guess uh maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you would n't convict someone who maybe should be convicted 
um-hum 
have you ever served on a jury before 
uh i have twice 
oh 
it was pretty wild experience 
uh what sorts of cases were they 
they were just you know small town cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know 
so were they criminal or civil 
they were civil 
they were n't they were n't any criminal 
oh okay 
what uh what was the verdict 
did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision 
uh the jury it was uh let me see i think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people so it was 
yeah 
they 
and uh the one changed his vote at the end 
so did it become 
so it became unanimous you know after they turned it in and then he changed his mind after they turned it in but it then became unanimous 
yeah 
ah 
oh but since it was a civil case it really did n't matter right 
you just needed a majority 
so right 
what was what was the other case 
that was also civil 
the the uh other case was just traffic 
the 
and you know it was seat belt law and it it did n't even hardly go through 
yeah 
oh did n't really even count 
so 
yeah 
i 'm i 'm a college student 
so i have n't been you know of a jury eligible age for very long um and uh i did get um one summons actually at one point 
yeah 
but i declined it which i 'm able to do because i 'm a student because it was uh a very bad time 
yeah 
well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though 
yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do it at some point um 
but uh i- i have n't 
um one one thing that i- i think is um you know maybe is a problem is uh i- i- i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now 
but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does n't work as well 
uh especially sort of 
it i would n't think that it does i mean from from my e- from what i experienced in them 
ow well 
it did n't you know it did n't did n't turn out the as the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go 
the ah but you thought it turned out pretty well 
it yeah 
but it was you know it was 
jury was unorganized 
and it was it was just was n't organized enough for me 
yeah 
so i 'm not used to it not being organized 
and i just a- assumed that it would have been 
oh so it was just kind of a zoo 
and the jurors just sort of 
someone had to figure out what was going on 
that 's that 's about what it was 
hum that 's interesting 
did it did it work out pretty well in the end 
i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial 
or 
yeah 
they well they picked the one person 
and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have 
so it worked it did end up working out pretty well 
so yeah 
it ended up working all right 
the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro- product liability or medical malpractice where there 's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes you know it 's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy 
yes 
and it 's just a matter of interpreting a contract 
it 's sort of a matter of uh you know sometimes getting into very technical issues 
and i wonder if uh if there 's really um if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion 
uh i do n't think that they they they educate them enough to to really know what 's going on 
in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a a bank matter of some kind 
so 
yeah 
the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer that which was assumably their property 
yeah 
ah 
it was on his property 
oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it 
and he had n't made the payments 
right 
so they came to get it 
yeah 
and then when they came to get it well i- it was on the landlord 's property 
and he would n't let them take it off 
ah so they were suing to get it back 
so and they 'd already it was a double wide 
so they 'd already taken it apart 
ah 
so they left it there and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it 
yeah 
uh 
so they were suing him for the money 
and you know there 's no way they could because it 's it was the moving company 
uh greg uh i 'm i 'm not familiar 
i think uh you guys in indiana 
do n't you have the the death penalty 
yeah 
we do have the death penalty here 
it 's not exercised very often 
but we do have it 
uh-huh 
i believe it 
i can n't even remember the last execution we had here actually uh personally i 'm in favor of capital punishment 
uh-huh 
i know there 's a lot of lot of problems with it 
but uh seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just uh i feel does n't deserve to live does n't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life 
um-hum 
right 
uh i know there 's a lot of problems with that 
like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten la- years later you find out that he really did n't do it then that life was wasted 
but just seems like in some cases that it 's a it 's a good policy 
um-hum 
um-hum 
uh i- i tend to agree with you uh 
i 've changed my views over uh e- even within the last few years uh to be honest 
uh uh when i was in coll- when i was an undergraduate i was a member of amnesty international and uh of course at that time you know i thought uh ho- it 's it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument 
uh-huh 
right 
but the uh the more 
now i live in downtown dallas 
and i uh you know i 've seen uh i 've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder 
right 
right 
i think that maybe a a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder 
that 's a that 's a thought that i had never really had on that wh- which seems pretty sensible 
yeah uh 
i- yeah 
it seems sensible and and fail-safe 
i- uh i- i do n't you know 
not completely fail-safe 
but if a man 's convicted of two murders uh you know there 's a pretty good chance that something 's wrong 
right 
uh i also uh 
to tell you how liberal i have turned uh toward this or or or whatever side that is i 've kind of chosen uh 
right 
yeah 
i believe that that uh big time drug importers like uh say noriega for example th- these people need to be uh eliminated uh from society 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh create another power structure 
yeah 
you 're you 're right there 
uh i ju- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just y- you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they 're going to be there for life 
you know the uh-huh 
right 
they 're never going to be rehabilitated 
right 
i mean i do n't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me i 'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who i in my mind should n't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society 
right 
um-hum 
so i i 'm all in favor of it 
um-hum 
uh do you uh 
are there cases where you think that that uh the capital capital punishment should n't be uh uh sentenced 
well i- i really do n't know on that question 
it just seems like 
for instance the jeffrey dahlmer case 
i mean i- i do n't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society 
i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets and in that case wisconsin does n't have a death penalty 
um-hum 
so he 's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment and i think that that he should not be allowed to live 
right 
but you know then you 're kind of playing god which is n- never a good thing to do 
that 's true 
yeah 
right 
but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld uh not really that i can think of 
i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers uh i do n't really agree with the uh death penalty for people like noriega and such as that 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
i think that they 're they 're operating on a more 
i mean i know that they 're causing massive problems in society up here 
but i do n't really think tha- that it 's it 's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you do n't deserve to live because they 're feeding our consumer needs 
right 
sure 
yeah 
i understand i understand your point 
yeah 
uh of course you know with uh with with dahlmer now uh y- you realize that ohi- i think it 's ohio uh gets to try him next 
and they do have the death penalty 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
so uh that was a curious case 
i 
y- yeah 
that is very curious 
uh uh that was something is sort of nightmarish to say the least 
yeah 
that 's that 's right 
uh well here in texas we uh 
i think even even this last week uh last week they had another they uh you know 
they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh 
okay 
i guess it took 
so i guess recording has started now 
yeah 
uh 
so have you ever served on a jury 
i served 
i was in the air force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury 
a lot of the same rules apply 
have you ever served on one 
yeah 
i finally served on one last year 
i 've um been voting for years 
and i could n't figure out why i had n't been called yet and i finally was 
uh-huh 
so it was an interesting experience 
i was kind of boring 
was it civil or criminal 
uh it was uh uh it was uh well let 's see it was municipal court so it was a combination of uh 
a grand jury or 
some- uh-huh 
and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks so it was a combination of criminal and civil 
i see 
and they had uh 
well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors and then it was always we was exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences 
or did you folks do that 
uh yeah 
the judge did 
uh i uh i had a hard time getting seated on a jury 
i kept getting uh 
i 'd be questioned uh for impaneling the jury 
and they kept uh dismissing me 
uh-huh 
um 
course they do n't have to give a reason 
but it 's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know 
no 
they want to get the best uh mix for their case 
so they ask all kinds of wild questions 
that that 's a science in itself 
yeah 
well i kept getting called up for drunk driving uh questions 
and i think part of it was they did n't uh they did n't like the fact that i do n't drink any more 
uh-huh 
i see 
because you 'd probably be uh too puritanical 
and to uh-huh 
yeah 
that was probably it 
although in my case i might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught 
i do n't know 
so uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair 
or would 
if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different 
well i was never there never there for any sentencing 
uh i finally got impaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day 
and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh decide the case 
and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he did n't need to deliberate because he 'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty 
and he would never vote for guilty 
huh 
so uh they appointed me jury jury foreman 
and i uh did n't think that uh going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict 
so i told the judge that uh we were n't were una- unable to reach a verdict because we could n't get one member of the jury to deliberate 
um 
so the whole thing had to be tried over again 
wow 
i bet that made him happy 
yeah 
yeah 
it was uh it was funny 
the uh 
i ju- i- i do n't know 
i uh i did n't uh uh i did n't like not being able to deliberate 
right 
and uh i uh i- i wanted to vote guilty for the guy 
and the other people were kind of mixed so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again 
uh-huh 
cost him a lot of money 
i 'm sure 
yeah 
oh how many members were on the jury 
was it a six or twelve member jury 
uh it must have been six 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that 's kind of curious to me 
i did n't realize until the uh wayne kennedy smith trial uh a few months ago that they had six member juries 
i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak 
um 
but uh apparently for some some crimes it 's permissible to have six people sit in judgment 
um 
i know on a 
getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it does n't require the jury to be unanimous 
it 's s- a simple majority you know rules 
yeah 
well let 's see 
is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous 
and 
yeah a probably on capital 
i do n't know 
we were n't we 
the two that i were on had to do with drugs and uh we were uh unanimous in acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things 
uh-huh 
the government really failed to prove its case 
and you know being fair to the person if the government does n't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what 's offered as proof 
and we had to acquit him in both cases 
uh t- it was too circumstantial 
uh yeah 
it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person 
but something happened to the camera and the tape and all they could do was testify about 
um 
pretty good 
pretty good 
so we 're talking about drug testing in the work place huh 
drug testing in the work place 
um i 've been tested a few times just before pre drug employment 
but that 's about it 
i 've never had random drug testing 
yeah 
we have random drug testing at in my business 
but i 've never been uh never had to do it 
oh really 
yeah 
yeah 
they started that about a year ago 
and i think it 's mostly for the the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff 
wh- uh-huh 
but uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time 
at least that 's 
oh they do with alcohol 
pardon 
they do it with alcohol 
yeah 
yeah 
they they they they 'll check for alcohol 
oh i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine 
now 
once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you 're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing 
huh that 's interesting 
yeah 
it 's a 
what type of field of work are you in 
i 'm in the oil business 
oh in the oil business 
yeah 
okay 
and you work in the office around 
yeah 
i work in the office 
so uh it 's pretty pretty safe environment 
uh-huh 
yeah 
see i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and we work a- around a lot of explosives 
well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on 
yeah 
so that 's you know 
i 'm all for it because the well the type of environment i work in you know wor- they 're working with explosives 
and so they could blow up the whole 
well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use 
but still it can be dangerous 
yeah 
yeah 
well i- i- i agree 
i think that uh you know under certain circumstances especially when you 're working in in high risk uh uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff 
yeah 
you know 
if it 's 
as long as it 's not abused uh you know random you know 
as long as it 's random and and the individual 's rights are uh are protected i do n't have that big a problem with it 
now do they fire them or do they 
well see is 
this is where i start having my problems with my company 
i work for a private company 
and and the the policy is something like see if i can restate this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you 're eligible for company counseling 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
but if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired 
oh wow 
so it you know it 's sort of one of these little catch twenty twos 
huh that 's 
i think our policy is that 
all right it 's probably the same thing 
i 'm not really sure becau- anyway i do n't have the 
yeah 
really 
it 's one of those things that you read once 
and then if you if you 're not worried about it you just forget about it 
that 's right 
but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance 
but i 'm not sure if if it 's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in 
yeah 
yeah 
our yeah 
our company 's a little tougher on the second chance 
i mean if if they 're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know go out of the way i think a little bit more to uh to help you get you help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job 
uh-huh 
but uh when you 're not when you 're a private company the rules do n't always apply 
uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits 
well it 's it 's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment 
and you know it 's not 
i guess i ha- have n't run into anybody that 's that 's had a problem that 's that 's been a problem 
the uh-huh 
uh so i gue- you know i guess it works uh much like uh well shoot like any lottery 
i mean everybody 's got an equal chance to get picked 
uh-huh 
so uh i 'd rather have that than you know say well this week the a 's and b 's are going to be in 
and next week c 's and d 's are going to come in 
you could time it just right 
yeah 
right 
right 
i 've met one employee 
i know when i was working with he had alcohol on his breath 
and i 'm not sure if our policy covers that or not 
that 'd be just as dangerous 
yeah 
especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff 
huh that 's true 
you know i 've i 've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case 
um-hum 
do they give any limits on alcohol 
or is it 
uh i do n't remember to tell you the truth 
i do n't think they do 
um well i- they must 
i mean gee whiz 
that just shows you how much i 've been paying attention 
because i- i really do n't know 
i 'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask 
oh 
well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far 
uh there was a company in houston that 
they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of 
uh-huh 
it was not only drugs 
well uh i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing 
uh-huh 
um i do n't really think that it 's uh too many 
i think it 's a severe invasion of somebody 's privacy to say well we 're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you 're uh you know worthy of working for us 
i really do n't see that that 's a very very valid uh thing for a company to say 
and i personally i do n't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what 's inside my body 
yeah 
uh i guess i basically agree that uh 
do you think it 's okay for a company to reject somebody just knowing that they have take drugs 
i mean suppose they found out some other way 
well i think i think wh- y- i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs 
yeah 
there 's too many cases where it can you know 
there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing 
i do n't think there 's any definitive you know 
okay this person is taking drugs 
so we do n't want him here 
s- yeah 
uh like i said some industries though i think it 'd be very necessary 
i would n't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i 'm flying in an airplane 
yeah 
but uh i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it 's such a a big deal 
i mean if your employer 's not going to trust you 
or you know it 
i just i think it 's a whole trust issue 
i just can n't see it 
have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested 
or 
uh yeah 
i have been 
yeah 
i uh i mean i was very offended by by the whole process 
i have once too 
so 
yeah 
i mean it 's it 's very humiliating 
and i mean i 'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs 
but i uh i am totally against that sort of a uh 
i mean it 's it 's a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before i 'm going to talk to you 
yeah 
i had it during a job interview 
and i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them to do this 
right 
and i 'm just like well uh i 'm not even going to think much about it if you 're going to treat me with this much respect even before you 've gotten to know me 
yeah 
right 
right 
that that 's basically my opinion on it right there is that it 's just you know 
i did i it was in the same sort of situation as 
it was a job interview 
and then you had a physical where you were drug tested 
and it 's 
i just 
i mean i know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know been hired by a corporation which uh you know 
i really 
the other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of of personal privacy as in my it 's my bodily fluid 
and i do n't really want you to look at it or or something pretty basic like that 
uh-huh 
just to the fact that i do n't know that it is a company 's business to regulate what it 's employees are doing when they 're not at work 
i mean the during the eight hours during the day when they 're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not 
but when it enters into what they 're doing when they 're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also 
yeah 
well like you say i mean if it 's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors 
right 
right 
and i mean if you are doing drugs and it 's causing a problem then they 'll notice it for other reasons 
that 's exactly right 
yeah 
and also i just think it it gets a lot 
i 'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies 
and i think that it just moves down along a line that that i really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees lives outside of work when you know 
there 's already talk of people 
well we 're not going to hire you if you smoke 
well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you do n't want them to smoke 
but when somebody leaves work i do n't think that it 's the employer 's right to regulate their lifestyle at all 
well do you think it 's should be illegal for an employer to do this 
or 
uh i really think it should be except as i 've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it 's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times 
yeah 
and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable 
i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that 
it should it 's kind of the big brother syndrome 
i mean i just 
anything like that just kind of scares me 
hum i tend to to view it 
even though i do n't think i 'd work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend an employer 's rights as opposed to an in- uh in addition to an individual 's rights 
but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to and if they say they do n't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that 
right 
right 
uh and i do n't really 
-llo 
oops hello i pressed the button one 
so we 're recording right now 
i 'm sorry 
that 's okay 
i 'm bill from raleigh 
okay 
and i 'm melanie from harrisville utah 
oh so another one from a different state besides texas 
yeah 
um okay 
bill we 're talking about family reunions 
right 
okay um 
have you ever had to plan a family reunion 
uh yes 
and no 
it was n't really a fa- a planning one 
but it was kind of uh it was a birthday and i brought a lot of family together then 
oh 
uh-huh 
and how did you feel it went 
it went pretty good 
i 'm i 've worked in hotels 
so i- i kind of know how to do these things 
oh 
i used to you know 
all of this planning and and getting together and such 
um oh let 's see what else 
usually when we have kind of our family reunion it 's my grandmother 's birthday 
and and it 's all of like she she comes from a big family 
uh-huh 
she has like seven sisters i think 
oh boy 
and they show up and all their kids 
and then a- she has uh 
i have like uh 
let 's see 
she has four sons and two daughters 
and they show up and all their kids 
uh-huh 
so it 's a pretty big reunion 
it 's about two hundred people maybe 
oh my word 
oh well what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together 
um the probably the biggest challenge was uh getting a place where everyone you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh 
uh-huh 
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that uh for the rent uh we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that 
oh 
uh-huh 
and uh each one of the everybody that showed up do- donated some money for the rent and for for like soft drinks 
and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill 
oh 
oh that 's good 
each person in the family you know brought a dish or some 
uh-huh 
and then did you have a main meal 
or did everyone just bring 
it was just potluck 
it was kind of potluck 
uh-huh 
you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say 
yeah 
yeah 
show off a little bit 
yeah 
and of course my grandmother 's food was as always gone first because she 's such a great cook 
oh 
oh 
now how old is she 
uh she 's eighty six 
oh goodness 
is she pretty spry is she you know pretty 
now she does 
she looks probably like she 's in her early sixties and if she did n't have arthritis she 'd get around better than me as a matter of fact 
oh wow 
uh-huh 
oh 
oh well that 's neat that she 's in good health and that at that age 
yeah 
oh yeah 
uh my nickname for her is honey woman 
that 's what i call her 
oh really 
well that sounds fun 
well i i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago 
and there were 
we sent out five hundred uh announcements because our family is quite large like your your family there 
and so that was a real challenge 
and i was president of our family reunion for two years 
and i was n't sure i appreciated that duty for two years in a row 
but i found that advance planning was the key to success 
uh also one thing that 's helpful 
and i do n't know if your family 's spread out or whatever but most of all my family lives like in the same county 
uh-huh 
so 
oh well that was wonderful though 
it 's just kind of like get on the telephone 
and it 's so and such days from such and such date and everybody just shows up 
oh 
oh well that is that is helpful 
yeah 
our family ranges from oh goodness well australia 
i have a brother lives in australia to uh boise idaho and and uh all kinds of places 
i would say you 're spread out then 
we are 
uh my my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we 're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever 
because my dad was in the army 
and we w- we were pretty strung out all over 
oh 
but since they 've moved back to carolina 's uh we still are the only ones do not live in in anson county 
in 
oh 
i live in raleigh 
and then my my parents live in greenville 
and i have one brother and his wife live in greenville and um another brother that lives in outside of fayetteville 
uh-huh 
so i mean we 're we 're we 're spread out 
but everybody else is centralized in in my home town waynesboro 
boy 
so 
oh my gosh 
nobody moves away except us 
they must really like it there 
yeah 
i got out as soon as i graduated 
yeah 
oh 
just like this town is too small for me 
good-bye 
oh you 're ready to move on to bi- 
okay 
you want to start 
yeah 
i might as well 
uh one of the things i 'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh uh uh issue 
uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre- different types of freons 
and it uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak 
uh-huh 
yeah 
now that 's stuff we never even thought about three years ago 
right 
right 
and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive 
uh they could be made uh you know che- inexpensive and lots of it uh 
and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery did n't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work 
uh-huh 
so 
so have they stopped that practice now 
well course there 's only a a tremendous number of a refrigerators and fre- excuse me refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve 
and of course the the new cars i guess starting with ni- nineteen ninety three will not have freon twelve in their systems 
but uh there 's you know there 's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera 
yeah 
and that 's got me very con- you know highly concerned that uh it 's going to be quite a while before we can uh undo this 
now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession 
but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion 
so we 're so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh have us uh as a an un- the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound 
yeah 
because as i say there is a there 's a tremen- 
well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator 
and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from and how many people especially here in texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning 
oh uh-huh 
yeah 
i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks 
and uh the only reason i did n't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the n-th degree and i mean 
uh-huh 
so uh that 's why i stayed in stayed more towar- towards uh uh 
and that 's a pollu- polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and the those two mixed together with with water and uh really make a uh make a mess 
um yeah 
yeah 
i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that that 's putting out a lot of dark smoke 
um-hum 
and i know there 's a lot of pollutants we can n't even see coming out of cars 
right 
but that that particular bothers me 
well most most of the time when you see bus uh you know the buses with the diesel that 's uh those are carbon particles and uh carbon dioxide and water vapor uh 
uh-huh 
because when you when d- diesel is burned it 's it 
you know diesel fuel is burned in a in a in the diesel engine 
it 's burned so completely that you do n't have any uh uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is uh is not very volatile you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it 's gone 
oh 
um-hum 
yeah 
diesel is going to be around because it does n't evaporate easily 
and it 's got 
uh you know it 's it 's latent heat is high 
but it 's slow burning at at uh normal pressures 
that 's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio and so if i- the car sucks in uh fifty degrees 
oh i see 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
okay bill 
right 
yes 
okay bill 
have you done much camping 
uh yes 
i 'm a scoutmaster in boy scouts 
ah 
i camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend 
and during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year 
ha oh well that that sounds good 
i 'd say i camp quite a bit 
yes 
you do 
um now do you have a lot of mountain 
well you do n't have mountains in texas do you 
where do you find places to camp 
well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping and we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the uh sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again 
oh 
uh-huh 
oh 
oh my word 
well that sounds adventuresome 
how about yourself 
well um i 've done oh i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i 
um we have five children 
and so we have found that camping with the little ones is n't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves 
so we 've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out 
and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it 
but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains 
-ell that 's good 
and then the boys are our boys are old enough now 
they 're twelve and eleven 
and so they 're in- involved in the scouting 
and they do a lot of camping with the scouts and last year my one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week 
um-hum 
and so this year they 'll both be going 
and so that 's been real enjoyable for them 
great 
so 
what uh what kind of camping do they like best 
do they like it where they have tents 
and uh do they cook on stoves 
um yes 
they 've well 
no 
actually they 've i remember they have taken the the du- the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire 
and i do n't think they 've taken the stoves 
um last year they camped in tents 
and this year i believe it will be in tents also 
um-hum uh-huh 
o- course i imagine it gets cold in parts of utah 
so uh-huh 
yeah 
it does n't get very cold in texas 
so lots of times we do n't even take tents 
oh is that right 
we just use trail tarps 
oh and what does that consist of 
uh it 's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of uh places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent uh like a uh 
oh 
uh-huh 
they 're very light weight 
and we use them when we go backpacking 
so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh 
they 're not very heavy see so you carry them with you 
uh-huh 
and they 'll keep you dry or whatever 
oh 
yes 
uh see when when when we go camping here 
we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of tents 
and i like to sleep on the air mattresses 
i d- am not 
my bones are getting so old 
so i like to i like to sleep on the mattresses 
um-hum 
um so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that 
ye- yes 
in fact uh um last month we went camping 
we saw a lot of deer uh in the morning and in the afternoon just deer everywhere 
oh 
my word 
jeez 
uh 
so uh but it even though uh it was n't hunting season 
and we were with boy scouts 
so of course we do n't uh want to go hunting 
uh-huh 
but we got to see a lot of deer um out and about 
oh 
and there 's 
of course we see smaller animals all the time 
and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food 's put away and so forth because uh we have uh armadillos 
oh 
do you know what a armadillo is 
oh 
uh they 're covered with like a heavy armor type stuff 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
and possums and uh raccoons 
my word 
and uh we have those uh creatures down here that they like to uh they like to go hunting for a a midnight snack 
uh-huh 
and so that that uh that can be a problem if you do n't put all your equipment away 
oh but they wo n't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything 
they will if you attack them 
oh 
but most time they run away from you if y- if they s- if they see you 're up you know but they do n't have any problem walking right by you if you 're asleep 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
oh my word 
so 
well that sounds a little less fierce than bears 
we we want to go 
okay 
should begin 
okay 
all right 
uh i can begin this um 
basically i work for honeywell in minneapolis and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good 
uh-huh 
i 'm i 'm pretty pleased with it 
they cover uh just about everything vision dental medical uh you name it 
uh-huh 
and for me this is the first job i 've had where they 've covered that much 
so i 'm pretty satisfied myself 
uh-huh 
um what 's your situation 
i- i work for the university of new hampshire 
and uh our benefits package is n't uh is n't quite as good in in some ways uh you know 
oh 
overall i 'm satisfied with it 
we do n't have the vision care 
we do have the health care and the uh and the medi- or the dental 
um-hum 
uh 
are you a professor there 
no
