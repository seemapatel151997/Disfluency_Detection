okay 
uh first um i need to know uh h- how do you feel about uh about sending um an elderly uh family member to a nursing home 
well of course it 's you know it 's it one of the last few things in the world you 'd ever want to do you know unless it 's just you know really you know f- and for their uh you know for their own good 
yes 
yeah 
i 'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out 
uh our 
had t- place my mother in a nursing home 
she had a rather massive stroke about uh uh s- eight months ago i guess 
um-hum 
and uh we were i was fortunate in that 
i was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown 
yes 
so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it 
but there 's 
well i had an occasion for my uh mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while 
that was really not a very good experience 
uh it had to be done in a hurry 
i mean we did n't have you know like six months to check all of these places out 
and it was really not not very good uh deal 
we were not really happy with the nursing home that we finally had 
fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks 
and she was able to to return to her apartment again 
but it 's really a big uh big decision as to you know when to do it 
yeah 
you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available 
course there 's you know there 's not one on every corner especially in you know smaller areas smaller towns 
yeah 
um-hum 
yeah 
probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in nursing home 
and um she had used a walker for for quite sometime probably about six to nine months 
and um she had a fall 
and uh finally uh she had uh parkinson 's disease 
um-hum 
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house 
hm right 
sh- then she lived in an apartment 
and um that was even harder actually 
um-hum 
um-hum 
because it was you know it was just a change of change of location 
and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling 
yes 
i mean she tr- she had she had children all across the united states and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children 
um-hum 
right 
uh-huh 
and um that was pretty heartrending for her 
oh i can imagine 
i think when she finally came to the realization that you know no i can not i can not take care of myself 
um-hum 
that 's tough 
that 's really tough 
yeah 
i mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and you know facing that situation it it 's quite a dilemma 
yes 
i think 
my mother excuse me 
go ahead 
yeah 
well my uh my uh 
probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthened for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it 
um-hum 
i think that they they had a great deal of um 
all the brothers and sisters got together 
and they actually had a conference 
that 's great 
and i mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that 
that 's right 
and and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them and you know making that decision and then finding a place 
i- um-hum right 
yeah 
and everybody had duties to perform 
um-hum 
you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a a proper nursing home 
um-hum 
yep 
you were very fortunate 
and they 
i know 
they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming 
um-hum 
so so 
i mean it 
i mean i i i i hard- i i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me 
um-hum 
absolutely 
un- unfortunately at a lot of times it responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole family you know 
yeah 
yeah 
well we we 
and uh it 's usually not a very smooth smooth thing 
yeah 
we were uh l- i was lucky too that i only have m- one brother 
um-hum 
and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done 
my mother also was very very independent 
she had her own still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age eighty three 
yeah 
we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she was n't really you know really much aware of what was going on 
um-hum 
that nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing 
of course she would she would not have been happy there at all 
but uh as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us 
yeah 
yeah 
well with my with my grandmother i think it was it was such that uh that she did not have the problem with 
she was very well aware 
and her daughter came and visited her at least her daughter came and visited her and also her uh several grandchildren came and visited her everyday 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
that 's great 
and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest 
um i- i- i think it would be 
it was more of a relief for her 
um-hum 
sure 
and um 
i mean but she was truly she was truly aware 
i mean i i di- i do n't know how i would how i would deal if if one of my parents came with with alzheimer 's or something like that which is which is far more devastating 
um-hum 
um-hum that 'd be tough 
yes 
absolutely 
and um i i th- i think that what one thing that w- that they were really concerned with probably was the fact it was n't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care 
um-hum 
yes 
that the people that work there were very were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible 
right 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yes 
yeah we 
i i think i think i think you know for myself i i see that as probably the the what everything would hinge upon 
were fort- oh 
is it 
how close is it to a home environment 
yes 
that 's right 
that 's the that 's probably the major question 
um-hum yeah i think a great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the elderly you know in several in a whole lot of areas 
yeah 
yeah 
-se people are of course population is getting older 
yeah 
you know it 's it 's interesting that that a lot of the population in the united states is changing because you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time 
you know um-hum 
um i- matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families 
um-hum 
it was n't 
-t 's 
but i guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation we we do n't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it 's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier 
right yes um-hum 
um-hum 
that 's right 
sure 
absolutely 
and people are families are scattered so much nowadays 
uh yeah 
yeah 
i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family you know that that it may be one of the solutions to a lot of things e- e- even child care 
yes 
you know i mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not any of the grandparents would we feel they 're going to be a good they 're going to be a good caretaker for our children 
yeah 
but 
yeah just because they 're grandparents 
i mean they raised us after all 
jus- yeah 
just because they 're grandparents that does n't automatically make them a good child carer 
yeah 
but uh i 'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh i mean i 've i 've had a a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people especially where they 've had uh extended family 
and i and an- i i kind of see that that you know perhaps you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know 
um-hum 
i mean uh it 's 
money seems to be too big of an issue wi- with with with with with what 's going on today 
oh yeah 
sure 
realistically it is 
and i i think i think that we may not you know that may be you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problems 
yes um-hum 
that would certainly help 
i mean i mean we may not we may not have as high a standard of living but the qua- but actually have a truer standard of living 
yeah um-hum 
right 
that 's just a matter of defining priorities i guess or some priorities anyway 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i think your right 
okay 
well i guess that was it 
okay 
was good talking to you 
okay 
yeah 
all right 
take care 
hey 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
alrighty 
uh i guess our topic today is air pollution 
and we are to just discuss what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us 
right 
um does your work entitle uh anything in environmental along these lines 
me i 'm in the legal department 
and um we do have uh a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues 
um-hum 
and i do n't know too much about the air pollution thing 
i do know for other types of uh pollution like the toxic waste and such that ti has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know we 're coming up with a a new solution 
we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump 
and we just transport to these places 
but after while it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak 
and then you have to clean it up and such 
but the new idea is to take everything up to sherman 
and we 're going to have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there 
very 
and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what i 've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up 
and that we wo n't be polluting the air 
i 'm sure we have to have uh permits you know for that place and that there 's you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air 
yeah 
it 's uh having uh uh 
w- well i work in too i work in environmentals uh projects right now 
oh okay 
and so the sherman deal is uh uh uh lost a lot of hair over that project 
oh 
uh what we run into um is we have the texas air control board tacb that send out uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh uh reply to 
uh-huh 
and a lot of their rules and regulations are n't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the tacb which is located in austin in writing 
and hey look what we 've done here at ti 
um-hum 
and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to um uh this is air side a- allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage 
uh-huh 
it 's in in in tons per year 
okay 
um and so w- w- you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in uh high-tech scrubber systems uh that uh scrub out the nox and uh vocs and and the ammonia compounds uh li- all the acids uh to a certain level 
we 
um-hum 
are very um uh aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions 
so if you do n't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or there abouts 
and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there 's a problem 
and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely uh it becomes a real issue especially when it 's smoking 
and you have to get it fixed el pronto 
hm 
as you know the they 're allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect 
hm 
so it 's a full time uh everybody has your home phone number type of job 
uh 
now is that place built 
or you 're still in the makings of it 
the sherman facility we are still in the closer to but still have a little bit of um finalization to do 
right 
it 's been pitched to the sherman uh city council with uh open arms as well as the public 
hm 
we had open forum 
and and uh uh tom jones our environmental corporate environmental guy 's handling the project 
um-hum 
and uh it 's real uh going real well 
i think it 's matter just a matter of fund the funds right now as i understand it 
um-hum 
uh but it 's uh it 's something else 
yeah 
tha- they 're in the same issue 
we were uh hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there uh because the the system is setup where it wo n't have any emissions 
uh you 're correct 
it will have something coming out of the stack 
obviously just because human nature 
right 
but it wo n't have uh any uh any bad stuff 
so uh i think ti we spend o- o- of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh uh first thing we always look at 
and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the systems than any other firm i know of 
we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here 
and uh it 's an interesting job 
but um 
well i know from some of the sites that we 've had done quite a list of sites that have gone bad 
and you have to clean up 
and you know the law now is a super fund 
and anybody who 's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know uh damaged the ground or not uh everybody has to contribute 
and it 's been a lot of big bucks when we 've uh gotten pulled into these uh super fund deals to clean it up that 's you know mega bucks to uh you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area 
and um certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground 
because eventually you know i- it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area it still only in time starts to leak out 
possibly 
yeah 
hm 
there there was one site that they cleaned up 
and then the new place leaked again 
uh 
i 'm familiar with that one 
we uh we have stuff that 's very interesting yeah 
we have hoods 
we have ductwork and all those type of uh interesting pieces of equipment where they have uh that we sample and it may have uh over uh a certain emission levels 
jeez um-hum 
this is on the solid side 
and so we take it 
and uh we can n't deep well inject something like that because it 's a solid 
and we mix it with concrete and actually um potash per se and and concrete and then actually put it in the ground but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it 's basically a concrete slab 
um-hum 
hm 
which is totally legal 
but the cost of doing this is astronomical 
um-hum 
they actually shave up ductwork and things 
and so we 're uh very very uh cognizitive and aware of all these type of uh expenditures because it can get very expensive 
but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the the world a better place to live and 
i think some of the folks that are n't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that 
i really would 
um i 've enjoyed speaking with you 
yeah 
this has been an interesting topic 
uh i was one of the i was responsible for all the planning and engineering of the corporate area in the north building 
oh you were 
yeah 
oh okay 
so uh i hope you like your office 
yes 
yes 
it 's a heck of a lot different 
i mean w- we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk 
we were about the only place in you know ti that had the gray metal desk 
yeah 
people used to come and laugh and go gee i had n't seen one of those in ten fifteen years 
yeah 
glad to see y 'all taken care of 
well the i think what changed everything and uh is uh y 'all w- y 'all the only ones that make any money for ti here in the last two years s- 
we 
finally got a little respect 
nobody thought of us as a profit center before 
exactly 
and that 's um when you start m- when you start paying your wages you know jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys 
right 
right 
i 've enjoy- 
not just overhead 
exactly 
i 've enjoyed speaking with you 
you too 
see you later 
bye-bye 
bye 
hi cynthia 
what did you wear to work today 
um let 's see 
what did i wear to work today 
um actually i wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse um and flat shoes 
so can you dress pretty casually 
um on occasion on occasion 
yeah 
um i do vary 
um you know i wear suits 
i wear skirts and sweaters 
on occasion i can wear jeans 
um how about you 
well i um run a business out of my home 
um-hum 
so i tend to get up in the morning put on sweats um do whatever i want to do with the kids then whenever i have a meeting with a client i 'll put a suit on and then come home and get back into regular clothes again 
and 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
um you know there 's real no no no real dress code where i work 
um you see people wearing you know all different attire 
i um do n't like to wear heels that really tires me out 
i work in a big building 
yeah 
so i i- predominantly wear flat shoes 
um you know in the winter i wear sweaters 
in the summer i you know i like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that 
i 've recently um t- tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that i can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot 
right 
right 
that 's helped me a lot with having 
i can only have a a limited wardrobe since i 'm only working part-time right now 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
um but still it gives it some variety add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that 
um-hum 
right 
right 
accessories 
uh-huh 
what about your casual wear 
do you like to wear jeans most of the time 
um yeah 
mostly 
i mean at home i predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that also 
yeah 
it 's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it 's so hot 
yeah 
well they 're um you know they 're like ber- 
dress shorts 
yeah 
they 're like black corduroy ber- bermuda shorts 
yeah 
and sometimes i wear a blazer with them 
and i get really a lot of compliments on them 
um where i work is predominantly male 
yeah 
so you know they 
their attire is always the same you know suits or slacks you know jeans whatever 
not 
much 
and um but i 'm really the only woman i guess at work that does that 
but seems to work for me 
yep 
in fact i just bought or i just got a new outfit as a gift that um 
it 's one of those skorts 
you know the 
the it 's shorts but it looks like a skirt 
um-hum 
so i think that 'll be good for work too 
oh yeah 
it 'll be comfortable 
yeah 
yeah 
so 
i guess down here uh 
we just recently moved to texas 
so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit 
uh-huh 
um we moved from colorado where 
and i have a closet full of sweaters 
uh-hum uh-huh 
that 
well see i live in virginia 
you live in virginia now 
uh-huh 
oh that 's interesting 
yeah 
yeah 
so i 'm 
you know like right now today was in about you know the fifties 
uh-huh 
but um you know i i- do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses 
yeah 
i 'd like to be able to wear those here 
today it 's eighty eight degrees 
oh my 
so 
uh-huh 
needless to say my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now 
uh-huh 
today was uh definitely a shorts day around here 
um-hum 
yeah 
we 're still pretty much you know in winter as far as that goes here 
this is pretty uns- unseasonal 
but um at least we 
you know it it it feels good 
it gets uh 
everybody does n't have cabin fever today 
it 's nice to get out and about 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
i guess we 've discussed everything there is about clothing 
okay 
sounds good 
okay 
was nice talking to you 
okay 
it was nice talking to you also 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
this is archie 
hi archie 
i 'm sharon 
have you seen dancing with wolf 
yeah 
i 've seen that 
that 's uh that was a really good movie 
probably one of the best things about it was the scenery 
and uh i thought the story was pretty good too 
i th- i think kevin costner did a really good job with it 
have you ever lived in that part of the country 
no 
i have n't 
have you ever visited it 
um i 've visited the wyoming area 
i 'm not sure exactly where dances with wolves was filmed 
i think it was the black hills of south dakota 
could be 
i- i have n't been to south dakota 
ha- have you been up to that 
well i lived in omaha for five winters 
oh 
okay 
and that rolling kind of uh 
terrain 
yeah 
is is fairly fami- 
the thing that i thought was interesting was that the critics 
apparently it 's going to win everything 
really 
uh and i had been told you know you would n't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of 
that 's true 
i agree with that 
um i- i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it 
i think it 's been nominated for twelve awards 
and and all the critics initially said that you know it would n't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud 
so it it has surprised everybody 
well the interesting thing was is i had heard that 
and i- i- i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it 's that great 
and and it was the thing is it was a it was a good story 
uh-huh 
right 
and and and i guess that 's what i really like 
although i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour 
did you 
yeah 
have you seen sleeping with the enemy 
no 
i 've heard i 've heard that 's really great though 
y- you have to go see that one 
and how about silence of the lambs 
no 
go 
you must really keep up 
i do 
i go every weekend 
i- i uh 
those are two definite must see movies i think 
we- is n't is n't sleeping with the enemy is n't that a 
i- is it is it a terror movie 
or is it just suspenseful 
it 's suspenseful 
i do n't think it 's very t- 
i mean there 's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that 
it 's it 's more suspense 
um the other one silence of the lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody 's not into that kind of stuff 
it 's it 's pretty graphic at points 
but uh i think they 're both excellent movies 
do you do you listen to gary cohill 
no huh-uh 
cohi- is uh 
you know who he is 
yeah 
somebody in south carolina told me about him 
he 's a the movie critic 
um oh you 've oh 
okay 
he 's a movie critic -n channel eight in dallas 
yeah 
and he does uh he has a talk show on the klif 
anyway it 's on from seven to nine or something 
and and and people call in 
and it 's if you keep up with movies it 's kind of interesting 
there 's a certain amount of drivel that they do 
they 've got uh they 've got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old 
and they call in 
and they review movies 
but it 's uh he anyway he 
oh 
it 's interesting 
you listen to him 
and then you you go watch the movie 
fact they had people had just seen 
i was listening sunday night a little bit when i was uh going to pick up my daughter 
uh-huh 
but anyway it was uh i- the 
it it 's interesting though 
the the the difficulty with with dancing with wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was going to be good 
or did he just do it 
i think that i think he really 
his heart was in it 
but i d- i do n't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was 
i think it was something that he really wanted to do 
he wanted to direct it 
he wanted to a- to star in it 
you know he he enjoyed the story line 
and i think he just really w- he really wanted it 
whether it whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy 
because i think that i think he did a good job 
and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him 
do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver 
um 
a little piece of trivia 
you know the guy when he first headed out from the army post 
yeah 
who 
no 
i do n't know who that guy is 
he he plays on murphy brown 
oh he does 
yes 
he 's he 's eldon her housepainter 
as a recurring character every week 
oh 
do you believe that 
no 
now see i 'd a i 'd a never put those two together 
that 's that 's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that 
huh-uh 
i thought no it 's really funny 
but i thought it it 
turns you think back 
and yeah 
it was him but with a you know with the beard and all that stuff 
yeah 
i mean it 's uh 
yeah 
real scruffy looking 
yeah 
real scruffy looking 
and it wa- it was really funny it 's uh that that he winds up playing in the movie 
but i thought it 's good that you know 
it was a lot of fun 
yeah 
i do n't know how long this conversation is supposed to go 
but we 're at about five minutes 
i should think we 've done enough 
you think so 
i mean i have n't been watching my watch 
um 
well i do n't know 
wh- how do we end this thing 
i think it just says hang up 
why do n't we do that 
good-bye sharon 
well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state 
that 's one thing 
and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that 's another 
and the first kind of invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me in very much everyday in this country 
but in the second type at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh um obviously everyday 
i i think i agree with that 
i think in a good example on the typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang 
and it 's ti calling 
my immediate reaction is th- -t 's some sort of strange phone message 
and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited 
that 's right 
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion 
but after that i realized no i i really wanted this 
and it was sort of exciting 
and so that was almost an example of a si- an invasion that turns out to be not invasive 
uh-huh 
right 
it turned out to be uh uh an invitation 
exactly 
uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it 
from from personal parties or from these uh phone answer- phone uh commercial things 
commercial 
soli- solicitations primarily 
oh that that 's a remarkable number 
i get them rarely 
and i 'm still astounded that that uh one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effectiveness whatsoever 
um because i 'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what they are 
yeah 
i think they prey on people 's um inherent politeness on the phone even with a machine 
i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say 
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there 's not even a person there 
and i think that 's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control 
and you one 's feeling obligated because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um i guess i 'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second thi- one that you raised 
yeah 
and i do n't think i would have thought about that 
i think that 's a good idea on your part 
i do n't typically feel intruded on on the things oh in the sense of finding out information 
well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known 
and i mean you know the classic oh i do n't know cia conspiracy theories or whatever would have uh such parties trying to do it without your knowledge 
so there 's things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it 
and i can n't talk about the second one other than to to to generate paranoia 
yeah to surmise 
and i 'd like to think that 's it 's quite low at least in this country 
to s- to surmise it is there 
i do n't feel like the kgb is monitoring my phone or anything like that 
well i guess although i well that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because uh if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest 
um-hum 
yeah 
and i 'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy has n't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded 
um-hum 
um if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it 's something you do n't know about it well then i guess one could assume one was invaded 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but i do n't feel invaded by it 
um-hum 
i do n't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things 
um-hum 
i 'm not sure why 
uh i guess it comes from a sense of facts or facts 
and if someone finds out something about me that is true i i do n't have a sense of loss from that 
um-hum 
well you must have a relatively clean conscience then 
uh the the other side of that might be uh if if s- there 's someone found out something or surmised something that were n't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense 
yes 
yes 
you 'd b- more harmed or something 
bec- 
right 
because 
yeah 
you do n't have anyway to turn it off 
the- 
did you hear about this lotus database that was being put together 
yes 
i did 
i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it 
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there 'd be cou- good possibility that their facts were were fantasy 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me that i would rather they did n't 
and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that that i would have thought to be private 
um-hum um-hum 
but then if it turns out to generate incorrect things that 's even worse 
uh or if my call rate of of eight t- or so a week went up even higher because uh someone had had 
um-hum 
um-hum 
they had you pegged 
right 
as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money 
and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now their advertising you 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
exactly 
yeah 
and i one of the problems with the lotus database was uh that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information 
i mean they said they would give it out to only select companies 
but uh you know just like software is only given out to customers 
i mean you can n't believe that 
right 
right 
it would it would be pirated 
and they would n't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who 's offering you know full cash price for it 
right 
i mean you know you can n't tell what what a company really has to do with it 
and there 's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are 
and you know and and that hacker just has to get into in touch with a sneak thief 
and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be you know an invasion of your actual home 
um-hum 
and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you 're feeling threatened as a result of of it 
yeah 
so s- maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is 
yes 
exactly 
um-hum 
i also hm thought about it because i was uh waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there 's not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there is n't 
but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy 
if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone 's going to invade my privacy very quickly 
um-hum 
and i realize that that i mean i can take that for granted 
but i used to i used to live in india 
and things are quite different there in terms of that 
there 's less of a sense of privacy 
in fact it 's said that no indian language has a word for privacy 
certainly a language i know does n't but just has a word for loneliness 
oh that 's interesting 
loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different 
but but no concept for wanting to be private 
yeah 
it 's it 's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially 
okay 
um so there 's not 
i mean doors do n't have latches on them 
people do n't tend to knock 
you just 
if there 's a door closed you open it because it 's in your way 
you people walk in and out 
and as a as a westerner in india i was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded 
oh 
th- that would be that 'd be culturally shocking 
you know it it very much is 
but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic 
uh-huh 
and people would leave me alone 
uh-huh 
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of socia- of um public behavior 
um people start paying attention to you very much 
and they start asking questions and in a sense are invite invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it 
but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms 
yes 
and which is n't al- always the case in all cultures 
and it was n't until i was thinking about it just now th- i realized that 's actually something that 's culturally relative 
that that is true 
i had n't thought about that 
and and that is fascinating to to think about someone who does n't know how to say private 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and they 've really um 
well i mean i i wonder how people have sex and things like that 
i mean they o- 
you go to india 
and it 's obvious you know the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years 
um but i i just do n't quite um 
there 's hope i actually for all 
for the time i 've spent there i still do n't quite understand how certain things that i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy 
yes 
because anyone can be alone for oh some period of time 
but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people will re- will respect 
yes 
and if that 's gone um i i r- really do n't know how to live very well 
and i wonder i really do wonder how people do that 
that 's interesting 
are th- are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either g- on a growing frequency 
well the class- the other classic examples the jehovah 's witness or or mormons or someone knocking at the front door um which is more intrusive because i have to f- really tell someone to go away 
and there 's that sense of i have now opened my door they now see what i look like what i live like 
and norm- and they 're doing something that normally i really only invite people to 
okay 
because i any f- anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me 
but no one is just welcome to come by my house 
so that is more of a sense of invasion 
so that 's another example of the invasion because of a nonsol- 
have you ever got one of those calls that 's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list 
and they 're either offering a service 
or they 're introducing some new product in the area 
and normally when they call you 're either in the shower 
or you in the middle of cooking something 
and you had to stop everything to run to the phone 
yes 
yes 
that is that one that you were talking about 
that was the big one i 'm talking about 
i work weird hours 
and invariably just about the time i 'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and you 're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone 
you either hear the cli- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on 
um-hum 
or you hear somebody already starting r- reading off a list of stuff that they 've read probably a thousand times that day already 
that 's true 
or the ones that are are generated by a computer 
it 's just a computer voice that comes on the line 
those are the ones that i really really hate too 
even had some of them 
the they 're voice activated 
and you 've got to say hello twice before they 'll do anything 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
sometimes i- i get them on my uh answering machine at home 
so and i hate that when i 've got a whole bunch of messages 
and i go through them 
and most of them are n't from anybody at all 
what i would love to see done to stop all of this 
uh-huh 
we 've got a thing in this country 
you can have your phone number unlisted 
um-hum 
i think a law should be passed to where any of these people 
i think it 's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything 
but if they 're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them 
um-hum 
yeah 
see i have an unlisted telephone number 
but i still get all of those calls 
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i do n't even understand 
so yeah 
i do 
i really feel that that 's uh an invasion of my privacy 
i agree with you on that particular subject there 
let me see 
that 's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences 
i put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people peddling products 
if i wanted their products i would 've either gone to the store to bought it 
or i would 've called for their s- salesman to come out 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum yeah 
that 's true 
living in an apartment complex though you know you can n't um you can n't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations uh 
but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around 
so usually what i do is i 'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there 's people coming around you know 
and they 're trying to sell something 
or or they 're from a religious organization 
and i really hate that 
i really really do 
i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago 
and um gosh it was about nine oclock at night too 
it was n't even what i would consider you know a family hour 
it 's time to you know start going to bed 
and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh jesus christ of latter day saints 
and uh i 've read a lot about uh that particular sect 
and i do n't particularly care for it 
so i especially do n't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me 
now i agree with their right to um pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to 
but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be in a house or in an apartment 
i 'm on my turf 
if i want them there i 'll call for them 
otherwise i do n't want to know they exist 
um-hum right yeah 
yeah 
no 
i- i agree with you there 
though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that 's fine with me too you know as long as they do n't try and pull me in and drag me in 
and and i do n't like the way that they do it either 
and and it 's their mission as they do as 
they go door-to-door 
and they go out into the public 
and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work 
and i do n't know 
i just um i just do n't particularly care for that at all 
and that that 's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion 
because i have my own 
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting 
i 've even gone so far as to put that 
i 've got a storm door on the front of the house 
and i 've put in 
i do n't know how much clearer it can be 
it 's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting 
i should have g- i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
yeah 
no 
i do n't uh i do n't have i did n't go that far 
but uh yeah 
i probably could do the same thing uh you know 
i do n't have a storm door 
but i 'm sure i could rig up something 
but you know i do n't think that that would stop people 
i mean it 's like th- they see that word 
and it says uh go instead of stop 
oh goodness 
wonder if there 'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers 
and then reverse it 
and do 
well that would be technically illegal 
it 'd be harassment 
oh gosh 
but i consider invasion of my privacy a harassment in itself 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
that 's true hm 
well what else 
i believe we 've pretty much summed everything up 
i know 
but i remember you you talked about something 
you started off and you said 
well let me think 
you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door 
you said something else 
and i can n't remember what it was 
and i thought yeah 
that that kind of touched a nerve right there 
but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door 
i 'm drawing the blank 
oh goodness 
okay 
is our five minutes up 
uh pretty close to it 
pretty cl- 
well i 've enjoyed talking with you 
well it was nice talking to you too jim 
and take it easy now 
okay 
thanks 
bye 
good night 
hello 
hello 
hi 
this is lois 
hi 
this is lisa 
and um i called you know from that the the ti database calling instructions 
um-hum 
yeah 
i got a call yesterday too 
this is a different subject though 
yeah 
this is about changes in women in the 
um-hum 
uh there 's really a lot is n't there 
yeah 
i mean there really is 
-t 's kind of an easy thing to talk about 
oh i guess the work force would be the main would n't it 
yeah um 
i think you have to push one 
and then we can start recording it 
it uh okay 
all right 
okay 
are you ready now 
yes 
okay 
like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations 
yes 
i know because i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there was n't very many opportunities for her i guess 
she 's in her late forties 
you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids 
and i 've never faced that at all 
um no 
i think n- now you go to work when they 're six weeks old you know 
uh-huh 
and you stay there 
and i feel like the next generation you 'll probably just work right along with your husband you know 
yeah 
um-hum 
i think it 's definitely gotten better 
oh i do too much 
and it 's just going to get better 
um-hum 
it really is 
because women are in every field now 
i mean i can n't think of a field that they 're not involved in 
oh i can n't either not a one 
i know at least in the medical field it seems like they 've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field 
um-hum 
i do n't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing 
yeah 
even in washington you know there seems to be lot more women involved 
yeah 
hopefully the next generation it wo n't even be an issue 
i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman 
yes 
yes 
i think that would be the best goal 
oh i do too 
just your qualifications 
and that would be it 
uh-huh 
exactly 
not what color you are how old you are what if your male or female 
that would be wonderful 
i guess it 's kind of an ideal world though huh 
yes yeah yes um yeah yeah 
i kind of think maybe in time that you know you 'll go by social security numbers you know 
yeah 
and that way they can n't say well they picked the male over a female or female over a male you know 
exactly 
or the way you look 
or the way you you know 
you yeah yeah 
yeah 
your age or anything 
i think that 'd be a wonderful way to do it 
they 'll just i do too 
just go by your social security number and then look at your qualifications that you know that you have 
um-hum 
and then 
and if you get it you know then 
um-hum 
also with uh women in the work force they 've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what 's it called job sharing 
um-hum 
like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or 
oh yeah 
uh-huh as a matter of fact that 's what i 'm doing 
is it 
um-hum 
it sure is 
that would be great 
it sure is 
or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on loa to have her baby we hooked up a a a terminal at her house 
and sh- you know we could send her messages 
and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house 
um-hum oh 
i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two 
and that worked out great too 
uh-huh yeah 
yes 
that is 
i mean that 's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it 
um-hum 
all it was was you know 
i mean she just used a phone modem 
and she was like she was sitting in the office 
so i think that 's real nice too to come up with different options 
do you like the job sharing 
yeah oh oh i do 
do you 
i really do 
i think it 's great 
do you work like half days or half weeks or 
uh well like one week she 'll work three days and i 'll work two 
and the next week you know i 'll work three 
and she 'll work two 
hm oh is oh that 's great 
we just share off like that 
uh-huh 
do you get the full benefits 
um-hum 
yeah 
we get the full benefits 
oh that 's wonderful 
but we 've just really got a wonderful system that we 're working under 
yeah 
especially with children and so many things going on that would be great 
yeah 
yes it really is 
and that way we 're not really missing anything out you know of those children 
either way 
uh-huh 
yeah 
you have your career and your home life 
and that 'd be a nice way to especially if you have young children 
um-hum yes oh it is 
it is 
well both of ours is school age 
but we do n't want to miss any of those pta 's and you know all of that 
um-hum 
oh no 
i think 
yeah 
my son 's just in day care 
but even that they have extracurricular activities 
and the older they get the more that you 're involved in that 
so so um-hum 
yeah yes i think it 's great 
i really 
yeah 
and i look for more of that in the next generation 
i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making 
you know when that subject comes up they can say yes 
that would be wonderful 
um-hum um-hum yes 
oh i do too 
plus i bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because you 've got two days off that you can do everything 
so you do n't have to you know unless you 're just really sick or the child 's sick 
yes but yeah yeah because most time now you know it 's just a weekend 
or just forget it 
um-hum 
oh yeah 
i have to plan way in advance because 
or what i 've done is found like doctors and dentists office with extended hours 
ye- uh-huh 
that 's been real helpful too 
like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening 
so that 's real helpful 
so you do n't you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour 
i do n't know how many times i 've done that to do something post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand 
oh yeah to do 
yeah 
so 
um-hum 
yeah i think we 've really come a long ways in that because 
uh-huh 
i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just 
it 's always been that way 
yes um-hum 
but i know 
yeah 
but i can remem- remember back growing up my mother 
i mean it was 
she always worked 
but it was n't that easy for her to just take off 
oh no 
i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick 
and i know she probably did n't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did 
oh yes um-hum where oh yeah 
i think there 's still some discrimination there where as you know men and wor- women work in the same job 
i think men get paid more 
yes oh i do too 
but i think that 's improving 
it 's such a slow process 
it 's frustrating 
but mean you can see that it 's wrong 
yes 
yes 
and you just want to make it right 
but at least the wheels are moving forward 
yes um-hum they really are 
yeah 
i think it 's getting better not worse 
well i should probably get back to my job 
i- know 
i know the feeling 
call again 
well it wa- okay 
and i sure will 
and bye-bye 
okay 
bye-bye 
uh do you have a pet randy 
uh yeah 
currently we have a poodle 
a poodle miniature or uh full size 
yeah uh 
it 's a miniature 
yeah 
i read somewhere that the poodle is one of the the most intelligent dogs uh a- around 
well um i would n't uh i definitely would n't dispute that 
i- it 's it 's actually my wife 's dog uh 
i i became part owner six months ago when we got married 
but uh it uh definitely responds to uh to authority 
and i 've had dogs in the past 
and uh it seems it seems to uh respond real well 
i- it she- 
she 's picked up a lot of things uh just just by uh teaching by force i guess is what i 'd like to say 
oh uh-huh 
so you you 've only known the dog wh- how long did you say 
well about a year i guess 
th- oh well uh is it uh uh 
how old is the dog 
it just turned two i believe 
oh it 's still just a pup 
pretty much 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i have a uh well a mutt myself 
i call it a uh a chowpherd 
okay 
it 's uh part chow and part shepherd 
and it 
as i understand it uh both sides of the were thoroughbreds 
so she 's a genuine chowpherd 
oh that sounds interesting 
she has the the color and the black t- tongue of a chow 
but uh she has the shape the shape of a uh uh shepherd 
oh that 's that 's neat 
how uh about how big then 
oh she weighs in at about fifty pounds 
so she 's a medium size 
okay yeah 
yeah 
but she 's big enough to be intimidating 
most definitely 
it is a fi- a fixed female by the way 
yeah 
and right from day one she was teaching me 
oh i would n't doubt it 
yeah 
she is she 's the most intelligent dog i 've ever seen 
course i 'm little prejudice of course 
well that 's understandable 
yeah 
that 's uh 
no the first time i brought her home she was only uh was it six weeks old 
and i spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area 
uh-huh 
but uh next morning she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom 
okay 
so on next night i spread the newspaper in the bathroom 
and she used them there 
oh 
but it was n't too long till she uh found out she could wait until i let her out in the morning 
yeah 
and since then 
uh i 've i live alone 
okay 
and uh i live in a motor home 
by the way i 'm uh an rv full time rver 
and it 's it 's such a pleasure to come home at night 
and sh- you can see her smiling from ear to ear she 's so happy to see me 
i see yeah 
definitely 
and uh i do n't know if you get that kind of greeting or not 
yeah 
i can honestly say we do um 
we uh just recently put a security system in our house 
and so now uh in order to uh to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her uh uh locked up in the the master bedroom during the day 
and then she 's got the the bedroom and the bathroom to for free run during the day 
but we 've always got a got a nose and a tongue pressed up against the window uh when we come walking up to the front door 
uh-huh 
she 's definitely ready to get out and r- run around 
well my dog 's an outdoor type 
she does not like to be indoors 
really 
uh she 'd rather sl- sleep outside on the the cold ground at night 
oh wow 
but uh i do make her come in 
yeah 
and i feed her indoors 
that 's to lure her in 
but during the day i have her on a uh on a leash which is uh on sort of a run 
okay 
i have a a thirty foot cable running from one stake to another 
okay 
and then attached to that is a uh twelve foot leash 
okay 
so she can cover quite an area 
most definitely 
and uh she 's the best uh burglar alarm going 
yeah 
yeah 
the yeah 
that 's a that 's a definite security involved in uh in a dog like that 
oh yeah 
she uh 
it 's the strangest thing though uh 
children no matter how strange they are or how new they might be can uh walk right up to her 
um-hum 
but adults if they 're strange to her or or they look suspicious or something boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off 
wow 
and i have not discovered yet where the the line is between children and adults 
that 's uh yeah 
that 's interesting 
but sh- uh she is a great comfort to me 
yeah 
i kn- i know our dog has had uh had some different reactions 
she 's never really been around children 
and uh if if the child is is pretty straight forward um she 's fine 
i- if a child is a little intimidated she 'll jump around and and yip and bark quite a bit 
and if the child gets scared uh she 's still trying to play 
but she does n't completely understand what 's going on 
and we 've had a little confusion w- with uh with younger kids 
uh-huh 
but uh you know that 's it 's a matter of exposure really 
um we uh took her home to uh my family 's place in south dakota 
and she was the one that was intimidated then 
there was about seven kids ranging from about three years to ten years running around the house all at one time you know come to visit grandpa and grandma 
oh uh-huh 
and the dog kind kind of felt out of place then because she was she was being fed and everything else from all directions 
she really did n't know how to handle herself 
what you mean she did n't appreciate all that attention 
so she really did 
she just uh she she was alm- she was just inundated with with all the attention 
uh she she kind of she kind of sat and and soaked it all in for a little while 
and then she 'd go get back in and try to play and and whatnot 
but uh it was it was just su- such a new experience for her 
she 's only been around one and and sometimes two people at the most 
so uh 
uh-huh 
what 's her name by the way 
uh pardon 
what uh what do you call the dog 
oh it 's uh mitzi 
mitzi 
yeah 
yeah mine is gin 
oh okay 
as in uh martini 
yeah 
actually it 's gin two 
i see 
because uh when i was a teenager in high school i had gin one 
but then when i went out in the world i could n't take her with me 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i had uh i had a similar uh experience 
i i grew up on a farm 
so i always had uh outdoor pets 
and uh the dog i had when i moved to dallas about five years ago was a uh springer spaniel black lab cross 
uh-huh 
and he was a real a real lovable type but uh definitely not an apartment type animal 
oh yeah 
so he uh he had to stay home 
ah what a shame 
yeah 
yeah 
it really was 
it he uh apparently had a tough time with it for a little while 
then he he got he came to accept the fact that mom and dad were his company from then on 
but uh 
um-hum 
oh well 
yeah 
well randy we 've just about used up our time here 
okay 
and i must say it was interesting 
most definitely 
i enjoyed talking about pets with you 
well that 's great 
maybe we 'll get together again in the future 
that sounds real good 
take care now 
you too bye 
bye 
hi 
hi 
um okay 
what now uh what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like 
well i mostly listen to popular music 
i uh listen to it all the time in in my car 
so i i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i do n't like commercials 
but uh i find myself listening to popular music 
yeah 
and uh quite honestly i i have some little children 
and i 've unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of uh nursery rhyme music here lately 
but that 's not by my choice 
oh really 
how about you 
well um i do n't have that i do n't have that uh experience to share 
lucky you 
uh i i i do i do listen to a lot of 
you know i do i switch the st- stations a lot because i do n't have a cassette player in my car 
um-hum um-hum 
um uh however i d- i do i do like a a lot of different forms of music 
so i switch quite often 
um i- i think i like 
uh i i 'm really particular about the type of music that i listen to 
but the uh 
th- there 's such a wide selection 
i think i like a lot or i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music 
you know i i i- i i like music that is that that i feel 
if it 's performed correctly or if it 's done right or if the version is done right i like it 
yeah 
but if it if it 's not then i wo n't 
i i really do n't 
how do you feel about rap music 
rap 
it seems to be so popular these days 
yeah 
well i i do n't really have anything against rap music 
i 
d- the one thing i do object to about rap music is is i- when it becomes militant or if it 's uh violence oriented 
um-hum 
um-hum right 
i i 'm i- i r- i have i have strong objections to that 
um actually i listened to 
one time i -member it 's this is back when r- even uh 
i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i 
when it was really just starting 
yeah 
right 
when it was just starting i heard what was called talking blues which actually is rap 
yeah 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and uh it was about 
the the piece of mus- the piece of music was about i think about forty or fifty years old 
and it was incredible i mean the parallels you know between it and rap 
right 
and um you you listen a lot 
if you l- if you l- hear a lot of old gospel um uh especially well the black gospel 
you know you will you know you can really pick it up i mean 
yeah 
you really 
it seems to be influenced by a lot of different music 
a lot of times you 'll hear songs that you know they 're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm 
it y- yeah yeah 
and uh sounds th- sounds so much different 
and yet i i have a a much younger sister who listens to a a lot of rap music 
and uh she thinks it 's pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she 's listening to 
and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces 
yeah 
yeah 
they they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards i guess you could call it 
that 's right 
yeah so i think it 's kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they do n't really they do n't really give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit that 's really due to them 
no 
yeah 
i guess there was even a a bit of a ruckus caused by the mc hammer who 's really you know 
yeah 
seems to be the hot one of of today 
he used um wild thing 
do you remember that that song 
yeah 
he used 
i can n't remember who the artist was on that 
um-hum yeah it jimi hendrix was the original 
who 
jimi hendrix was the original 
he wrote 
was it 
well may- maybe it was n't that one 
then because it 's a living it was a living person that i 'm that i 'm thinking of that um that said you know hey that 's those are my words 
okay 
and uh i guess that they 're they because he had n't originally gotten um permission from him to use it 
um-hum 
and he he since then has has amended that and paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on 
but 
yeah 
i do n't know 
it may 've it may 've been somebody else because i th- i think that even jimi hendrix did a 
i think that was a cov- 
i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of like a john lee hooker song or something 
maybe so 
i i can n't think 
i mean it was like 
it was really old 
i mean i i 
it it a l- there 're a lot so many different songs 
i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times i mean i 've heard some songs that that i just thought were horrendous cover versions and 
i 'm like you know i i do n't want to listen to this because you know you think of the original it 's like 
yeah 
you know oh that was really great 
that was a you know really good piece of work 
and then y- when you hear the cover it 's like you know god you know what what are they doing 
well right 
they destroyed it 
to this oh i th- i think a good one was um 
there was a peter frampton song 
oh yeah 
y- and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolu- it was pitiful 
i i remember seeing the video of it on mtv 
and i thought it was hideous 
yeah 
there 's 
it was 
oh i did n't like that either 
yeah 
but you know whatever became of peter frampton 
i mean there was nothing 
he was a phenomenon 
i mean there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything 
i remember i saw him in a concert when i was 
yeah 
yeah 
i i think i think that 
i was in high school 
prob- yeah 
i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer 
um-hum 
he was very goo- 
i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in um philadelphia 
it was in jfk stadium it was i do n't remember 
yeah oh man 
hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like 
yeah 
i 've i i graduated back in seventy nine 
so 
um-hum um-hum 
but but i really 
i i loved 
i mean i was i was really into the album oriented music even then 
so i was really familiar with a lot of with a lot of the aor type music 
um the the album oriented like the uh james taylor and the uh the beatles 
oh yeah 
and you know i mean a lot of people they go you know they 're better than the beatles 
and i 'm like you know you you do n't know what you 're talking about 
hm no 
oh i mean you know c- the comparison made between new kids on the block with the beatles i mean it was just 
oh you can only laugh 
yeah 
you just sort of 
you know well i guess i can just humor them you know at this point 
right 
well they 
i guess w- ou- our age is showing when we when we think that 
but yeah 
but we- well you know i mean i i 've i liked a lot of the new music 
i think um um when 
um-hum 
i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out um back in the in the mid and early eighties 
yeah 
and then um i do n't know 
music is kind of in a weird it it it 's in a very weird position right now 
i think that 
i mean i like you know things like to hear you know like what they call world music which is you know using all these natural forms of music 
and 
like paul sim- 
yeah 
yeah 
paul simon 
yeah 
well you know really that 's not world music 
but w- what paul simon 's doing i think is is is is great because he 's uh you know i think i think that you know using a i guess what they call it is eclectic you know u- drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a a synthesis of a new type of music um 
yeah 
what do you mean by world music 
well world music is um 
a lot of the a lot of where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener 
um-hum 
uh for example let 's say you 're taking like an original brazilian form of music a with a certain style 
and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for let 's say another audience let 's say a north american 
uh-huh 
and then when they hear it it it it 's a really it 's another form of music and you know it 's sort of um trying to draw out the best sources 
huh 
the the best of every type of music 
right 
because i mean there are some i mean 
i l- 
there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like 
but but i would n't i would n't say that i i completely like heavy metal 
no 
i i think 
you know i- and it 's the same way with 
w- you know world music takes the forms that have really been um 
i guess i 
you know the best example or you know the cream of the crop i guess you could say 
and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that extremely enjoyable and then taking 
so then it becomes a kind of music o- of it 's own so to speak 
or hm 
yeah 
yeah 
it becomes a kind of music of it 's own 
i mean when you listen to it it 's um uh 
i think that they do n't use elec- 
el- some of it 
it 's 
it 's they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably 
uh-huh 
so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from south africa now and from west africa that 's considered world music because it 's not particularly using certain types of folk styles 
right 
but they 're they 're trying to make it somewhat more modern 
i i a 
a good ex- another good example was i heard miles davis 
and miles davis worked with ravi shankar if you can believe it 
uh-huh 
i mean you know he 's this jazz performer 
uh-huh 
and then he 's playing with ravi shankar who 's a very good 
he 's a very good arranger 
uh arrangement to but uh 
were going to get off 
they 
are they trying to 
i do n't know 
but no 
stop putting in a little interfer- okay we 've talked our five minutes though 
yeah 
okay 
but yeah i mean when i heard his album when i heard it and it 's just incredible 
oh i 've been listening to that a lot lately 
yeah 
i i listened 
and i heard 
you know you hear this sitar 
and then you hear this the muted trumpet 
and i mean you never th- would think that they that they can actually play together 
but 
go together y- 
okay 
so um 
yes 
we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago 
we have a computer here at the house 
uh-huh 
and i made a lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month 
and then basically since then what i 've done is is keep track of it through the checkbook 
so that based on whatever we 've got coming in check coming in and how much i 'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also sp- 
and because our house payment is once a month 
that 's our our biggest uh expense 
so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even though it 's really still there so that i can keep a a good balance running total yeah through the month 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh a running total 
yeah 
what do y 'all do 
uh we 've we 've uh taken how much we have you know write down how much we have coming in each month 
and then uh we 've 
at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend 
we sat d- made up different accounts like you know 
we 've set a budget for each you know household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that 
and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book 
and end of the month we tally it up to see if how close we 've you know 
we we try to stay within a certain budget 
so 
um-hum is it is it hard to keep track of it 
or does it work out pretty well 
um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it 
but it it works out real well 
so 
um-hum and and you 're staying within your budget and keep everything is working pretty good 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yeah 
i stay w- i have to stay within it 
so i you know 
and then we have that you know 
if you can n't stay if something comes up and you can n't stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something 
and some- un- unexpected comes up then you 're not you know you do n't feel it so strapped 
yeah i foun- um-hum yeah you do n't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and and do that 
right 
yeah 
because we do n't you know we do n't charge anything that we can n't pay off by the end of the month 
yeah that 's a good choice 
we 've been trying we 're trying to uh do that this year 
we 've budgeted the money that we used to spend we were spending on a coda account with ti and then money we were also buying stock with for that year 
we 've taken that this year and said we 're going to pay off all of our credit cards 
uh-huh you got paper under your table 
and uh we have a another loan with the bank 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that we 'll be free and clear 
to be out of debt 
free 
yeah 
the only thing we have it to pay off is our is a automobile loan and our house payment 
and that 's the only thing we ever 
yeah that 's good to be in that kind of shape 
we try to stay out of debt 
what are y 'all trying to do long term 
so uh-huh oh as long term 
we just 
he h- you know his retirement plan and then to coda and stuff like that that 's all we 've 
and you know we just have our life insurance for right now 
uh-huh 
so we do n't have any long term you know in stocks or anything like that right now 
so 
yeah 
mostly what we 're doing we 've worked we 've done the uh coda account with ti where they we put in so much a month 
and then they or so much a paycheck and then they match it 
yeah 
that 's what we 're doing 
and so that that has worked out pretty good 
and then i used to work for ti 
and i have 
when i retired from there or left i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an ira 
and we had an out we had an existing ira 
so we have both of us have some money in an ira that we 're also trying to figure 
to put it we 're putting it in cds right now 
so yeah uh-huh uh-huh 
and then we 're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund 
yeah 
whenever we get enough saved we we stick it in a cd for a while 
and then uh you know and then when we if we need it we wait till it it 's expired 
and then so 
um-hum yeah 
the other thing that we 've done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um 
han- oh john hancock company came out 
and their agents did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what we were pla- what what what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kid 's college paying off the house buying a different house um special thing buying land and building our own house 
uh-huh 
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals and yeah or not or what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and money we could put in at what time 
uh-huh 
or not 
yeah 
uh-huh 
that sounds interesting 
we 've never done any- 
we have 
you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know 
and he 's set up uh you know determined how much we need to you know we need if something were to happen 
um-hum um-hum yeah 
that that 's the other financial thing i guess that we 've done is with our life insurance is since i 'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me 
that 's a a big thing to think about 
you know yeah right 
yeah y- you know 
if i would sell the you know 
if he something would happen to him i would n't stay in texas 
i would uh sell the house and move back home you know to my home town 
and and uh i would n't stay here in texas 
so you know i do n't know what he would do 
um-hum yeah okay 
i guess that 's most of my um financial plans right now 
but yeah 
mine too 
is is there anything you 'd like to add 
nope 
that 's about all for mine 
-kay well it 's been nice talking to you 
nice talking to you too 
okay 
wonderful touch tone telephone there 
uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading 
uh having have uh i have a wide variety of of hobbies 
therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide 
um i get a charge out of uh texas highway uh which uh is very colorful and uh not being a native of texas uh but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh about the different areas of of the k- of the state by reading it 
oh 
right 
i 've read that one too 
i only had a subscription once 
but my mother always gave me hers 
and i- i really enjoyed you know all the little things that you find out about texas 
oh yeah 
it 's it 's uh absolutely it 's great the way that it 's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things 
it 's pretty pretty neat 
um oh i like photography um magazines 
i do n't take a subscription or anything like that 
um things oh 
being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines 
and and uh kind of strange because i 'll it 's not unusual to uh see um an engineering manual or something laying around the house 
uh-huh 
and then i 'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it 
but uh 
uh-huh 
how about yourself 
well um i have an interest in art 
so i frequently purchase and read um books mainly on water color because that 's my big interest at the moment 
um-hum oh that 's great 
and um oh i guess i like a variety of things um lots of fiction uh type books 
um right now i 'm occasionally reading on a book about uh the mardi gras in new orleans and it 's history 
um-hum 
that 's fairly interesting 
i bet that would be rather interesting 
uh that 's uh self-improvement 
that 's that 's alw- well that 's that 's kind of a hobby 
but it is self-improvement uh from the standpoint of probably relaxing um 
yeah 
i- i do n't know that i read anything strictly labeled self-improvement 
how about you 
um well i hate to 
yes 
i do 
we um we have these classes we attend uh management classes 
then and they give you books 
and and the last book uh matter of fact i read was at america 's service by carl albridge 
it talks about um who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the ti culture here at texas instruments 
yeah 
um one of it 's great slogans is if you 're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is 
uh-huh 
uh so that 's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is 
and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer 
your my customer i 'm your customer sort of thing 
right 
um every now and then i 'm loaned the tape i can stick in the in the car cassette on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of pat haggerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type actually which all you know betters yourself 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
well i g- maybe i am into some things occasionally that i do n't think of in terms of self-improvement 
um-hum 
i mean they are 
but i do n't label it as such 
like what for example 
well i do n't know um 
i uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things 
but um they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself you know g- getting your yourself in gear to uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do convincing you that you need to get on with it 
um-hum sure 
sure 
how about items like um the one minute manager which used to be a big 
okay 
yes 
so those are self improvements 
sure 
um our supervisor uh suddenly bought all of us a book called what every supervisor should know by a main man named uh doctor bittel b i t t e l 
um 
and it 's a very layman 's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people 
and the very last chapter and i have n't figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers 
so it 's it 's ver- it 's interesting 
here again it 's it 's casual reading 
and it 's not eaten up with a lot of uh technical stuff 
and it 's really uh excellent fast reading 
and uh but as you say it 's it 's sometimes it 's difficult to to know if it 's you know 
i think if somebody wants to say -kay read these ten books because these are self-improvements i would probably be turned off to them 
yeah 
yeah 
he casually just walked into it and uh put down a stephen king book and uh picked up one of them it might be a little more interesting 
i do n't know 
i i 'm not sure i could take too much of stephen king 
that 's a li- little little heavy for me 
yeah 
they 're uh quite uh they 're hard to set down because it 's so interesting 
and course they 're always a little spookier than the movies 
but uh it 's always they 're always challenging to get through one of them 
yeah 
i have a hard time finishing books 
well i guess i also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that 's what i 'm involved in a lot at work 
um-hum 
in quality -pecially nowadays uh that 's almost everything that comes across the the the the the airways 
oh yeah 
you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other 
but i think sometimes the word is a little over used 
of th- exactly exactly right 
but 
yeah w- we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and do n't fully understand what wh- what it is we 're saying 
i think it 's it 's focusing in on the issue and walking your talk 
and and all that kind of rolls in together there 
yeah 
but uh that 's kind of part of it 
yeah yeah okay 
well any other comments 
uh not that i can think of 
um i think i 'm under my quota a little bit 
i need it if i if i make a phone call or two 
well we just started 
right 
ah this is true 
i 've enjoyed it 
well you too 
and uh good-bye 
ha- have a good day 
good-bye 
bye-bye 
all right amy 
how are you doing today 
fine 
fine 
oh all righty 
i think we know what we 're going to speak about 
yeah 
um tell you what 
i 'll start off 
how 's that 
okay 
you go ahead 
um i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we 're talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends in public places 
um-hum 
in public places 
there is one state that does that by the way 
yeah really 
what is that 
i want to say oklahoma 
i saw re- something the other night about it 
hm 
they do n't do them real often 
yeah 
which is obviously the death penalty 
yeah 
um but i think if we quit uh building these taj mahals with the color tvs and sixty doll- sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with 
and let 's just quit screwing up the system 
yeah 
well the sentences are so unbelievable 
i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he 's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months 
uh that 's pathetic 
that 's pathetic 
because they just say there 's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them 
or you know it 's just that 
it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what he 's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what 's his whim to decide it should be two months 
i- this is true 
you know it 's crazy 
a- a- a- and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to life in prison then he 's available for parole 
if it 's if it 's life and a day then he 's not eligible for parole 
yeah 
so what you know 
let 's quit bsing with the system 
well even if it 's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life 
we could spend that money you know for s- children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that 
exactly 
so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it 
a life for a life 
you know particularly for some of these really 
i mean there are so many just major major serial murders 
and it 's not just like you know one instance or something 
it 's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on 
the old charles manson case 
i mean the guy is really just should n't be allowed to to even even live 
yeah 
and 
the yeah 
there 's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that 
um yeah 
uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge 
um-hum 
the the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene uh when there 's uh my understanding when there 's uh a verdict and it 
for example there 's a hung jury here in fort worth two day in eight to four 
and bam bam the guy got off 
uh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son 
okay 
right 
yeah 
i heard about that on the news 
um kind of gets back to the second request we 've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict 
the a situation like that i 'd say no 
let 's just go like a regular vote 
eight to four tells me that there were eight there 's a per- certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey the guy 's guilty 
yeah right 
rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers 
and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a f- you know a fortune to keep doing that 
exactly 
and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution 
exactly 
because it 's not next day they have the start the trial 
whi- is x number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
i think that that if it 's an if it 's not a split decision uh go with the highest number 
and let 's just get on with the program 
yeah 
yeah 
uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there 's a jury because that 's what the juries are for is to make the decision 
yeah 
yeah 
um what are your feelings 
well if i 
i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from florida 
and she just has just really stiff penalties 
and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved 
it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact 
but likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that was paid off or you know had goo- a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through 
so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power you know if used wrongly 
so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway 
i do n't know if it prevents it 
but seems like the jury system does have it 's advantages 
but i also i 've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know 
and i do n't know how much they 're getting just a jury of their peers 
at that point they 're really getting a select group 
it 's not just random people 
hm 
it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury 
and that 's it 
yeah 
ye- i get back to price 's comment when he uh was found guilty 
he said well he did n't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods 
well give me a break you know 
you know he 'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he 's got his peers or something 
yeah 
exactly 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean you 're you 're in dallas 
so everybody 
i can n't believe they can uh 
like in a murder situations they look for juries who do n't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence 
you 'd have to be pretty dense 
yeah 
you 'd be in have to be in a cave not to know what 's going on 
or moving it to lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer 
yeah 
oh they 'd have to move it to taiwan for people not to know about it practically 
this is true so true 
yeah 
yeah 
well this has been an interesting conversation 
well really this is breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors 
i mean what can i say 
oh so you 're at the house 
you 're not at the plant 
no 
i 'm at home with two little ki- preschoolers 
my husband works for ti so 
oh hold it oh that 's good 
that 's good 
i thought i heard a holler there in the background 
but i was n't sure 
yeah oh yeah 
i 've got the dog and two kids waiting here 
i am locked up in the laundry room 
oh goodness 
well i 'll let you get 
okay 
thanks a lot 
bye-bye 
i enjoyed it 
bye 
okay um 
i do n't know about you 
but where i am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work 
and it varies like everyday i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next 
it 's pretty bad 
but it 's true you know 
they tend to try to be you know real lax 
and supposedly the policy is like you know we you know we hire these wonderful creative people 
and we do n't want to smush their creativity you know 
we want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want 
and you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next 
w- well i 'm kind of that way too 
i work in the legal department 
and where we are now what we 're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents 
yeah 
and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day 
it always seems like i 'm doing that 
and i can n't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around 
so if i 'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down 
but if we 're going to have a meeting where we 're having the attorneys come in or people from uh other party 's attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up 
yeah 
and i 'll wear a dress and hose and stuff 
y- yeah 
you know we 're kind of that way too 
i try to 
i 'm the same way you are 
i kind of try to judge from day to day 
i know you know where i am we work a lot with the customers 
and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time 
and and you know if i know that they 're going to be there you know y- you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up 
um-hum 
and if i know they 're not you know 
i i 've been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know 
um-hum 
and it 's just so it 's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress 
that 's right 
that 's right 
you know it is 
so 
a matter of fact i thought i had one funny story 
when um i was at ti the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes 
we had them in the warehouse 
uh 
and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road 
and it was n't air conditioned 
and if we were there like in the middle of the summer 
it 's unair-conditioned 
it was dusty and dirty um 
there was like a fan at the very end of the row 
and that was it 
and so we did n't really know we were n't supposed to 
we thought ti dress code was just dress appropriate to your job 
uh-huh 
we wore shorts 
we did n't know that was a big no no 
oh no 
and a supervisor from another area came up to us 
and you know this area where record retention is there 's only a few people that work there 
and he sh- he knew who worked there 
he should have realized that we were n't regulars in the warehouse there 
and he came up to us 
and he just said who 's your supervisor 
well he called our supervisor and our supervisor 's supervisor 
and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts 
uh-huh oh no 
he did n't at least say to us did you know you 're not supposed to do that 
that could have alleviated a big problem 
we ended up getting called out on it 
oh how awful 
sounds like mister power hungry 
yeah 
but you know just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spin out here at lewisville that had on a pair of shorts 
uh-huh 
and i do n't care 
you can call them split skirts 
and you can call them culottes all you want 
but these were shorts 
is all they were 
i mean i- i do n't care what else you call them you know 
if they 're below the knee okay 
maybe you can call them split skirts 
if they 're above the knee they turn into shorts you know 
and these were n't even really full ones 
i mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know 
and because these were n't even those 
these were like pretty short black 
and they were very dressy 
they were black velvet shorts 
and she had on black hose and black heels 
and she looked very very nice 
um-hum hum um 
but you do n't wear shorts to work 
you know i mean as far as i 'm concerned she was in violation 
and nobody says anything to them 
it 's always been a big problem in lewisville in the summertime 
hum 
you know if they just you know 
the management does n't ever seem to want to take an cut off you know that yeah no 
this is where we 're going to draw the line 
this is shorts you know 
yeah 
and and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know 
hum 
so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well god we have a pair of those at home too 
it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know 
but 
well i 've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the texteller machine 
yeah 
and they have said no 
uh yeah 
and then during the week you see these women in the you know 
just because you put on a pair of hose with them does n't make them not shorts anymore you know 
yeah 
i mean i 've never seen them do it without hose 
i mean they always have hose on 
but still it 's they 're shorts 
i do n't care what you say 
they 're shorts 
you know well i think ti 's dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know i 
i know i did n't know that eds has a very strict dress code 
i had a friend 
oh do they really 
oh definitely 
i had a friend who worked there for a year or so 
and they spell it out 
for men it 's particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and win- wing tipped shoes 
oh my god 
oh it is definitely lined out 
women are not allowed to wear slacks 
she wears coordinated suits 
i coul- i could n't afford to work there 
and a and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel 
oh it is spelled out 
oh no 
when i was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff 
uh-huh 
and it told about the dress code 
and it said these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way 
ti says no shorts and no halters 
you know that 's it 
yeah 
and eds is very particular about this hair cuts 
wow 
i mean it was like you can n't have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed 
i do n't know that that would be a good environment to work in 
i mean i i see 
i- i am more 
i do n't know about anybody else 
and a lot of bosses may say i 'm nuts 
but i am more productive when i 'm in pants 
i- i am 
i work faster 
i get things done faster than when i 'm in a dress and heels you know 
i 
it and it 's weird 
but i it 's i do i i can i can get so much more done if i 'm dressed comfortable you know 
well the uh the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had uh another person coming from washington our outside counsel 
and she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse 
but she really did n't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse 
right 
and she came with skirts just like she 'd be going into the office 
yeah 
and we 'd try we 'd try to say did n't you bring any pants or anything 
we 're we 're out here in the warehouse you know 
you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes 
uh-huh 
and you 're going to have to un- unload your skids look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid 
and she and she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt 
you can n't do that in a skirt poor thing 
oh yuck 
she finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants 
but you know i mean it was just completely miserable for her 
yeah 
that 's terrible 
that 's terrible 
gosh 
well i do n't know 
i just figure you know yeah 
sometimes i worry about you know if i go in in pants 
and i never i never ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know 
but i 'll go in in pants 
i mean today i had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and a and a like a peach colored top and you know not cruddy but not a dress either 
and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you do n't dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if you know if upper management does n't notice that and remember that later on 
but you know i do n't know if they do or not 
you know i see a lot of the managers 
and they 're in jeans 
so you know 
um-hum some of our people in the legal department 
we have um assistants to the general counsel 
and it 's funny 
because there 's one that always wears a suit 
a matter of fact he 's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned 
really wow 
and then there 's another one who 's who 's a little younger and a little more yuppyish 
and he 's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt 
uh-huh 
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it 
yeah 
and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes 
and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt 
so that 's just 
is n't that funny 
you you know with the you know the little suspenders or something on 
so we we 've kind of had a variety there 
that 's great 
but i think a lot of times it 's it 's mainly who they 're going to meet with 
they 're they 're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that 's how they are 
yeah 
if there just going to be meeting with tiers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they 're engineers that they 're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed 
and they 're usually casual 
that 's the way to do it i mean that 's the smart way to do it 
yeah 
it really is because your making you know 
if when they 're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in you know in a six hundred dollar three piece suit it 's going to make the people they 're meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know 
or it would me you know 
it 's it 's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here 
yeah 
yeah 
look at this slick guy 
i wonder what kind of money does he make 
uh-huh 
i can see it now 
well it was good to talk to you 
it was really enjoyable 
yeah 
this is this is kind of a fun project 
it really is 
i 've done i 've done some of the other speech programs 
but we 've never got to talk to another person 
it was always just talking to the computer 
oh yuck 
yeah 
so this is a little different 
well it 's kind of enjoyable 
i 'm really looking forward to it 
yeah 
well thanks a lot 
okay 
bye 
bye-bye 
okay um 
how 's it been this week for you 
weatherwise or otherwise 
weatherwise 
weatherwise 
damp cold warm 
hum-um oh no 
dam- 
we have we have gone through what might be called the four seasons uh in the last week 
uh-huh 
we have had highs of seventy two lows in the twenties 
my goodness 
well i do n't even want to tell you what ours has been like then 
it was ninety six yesterday 
i heard about th- 
yeah we set a record yesterday and uh v- very windy 
but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so very cool uh 
i think right now it 's like sixty nine 
hm 
and that 's cool for 
or if i- it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant 
no rain in the last month i do n't think 
ground 's very dry 
and our yard work e- everything is in bloom 
so our yard work 's pretty tough uh ground being dry 
but i guess it also uh brings about allergies 
we 're having a lot of allergies down here right now 
um-hum 
everything blooming 
and and the weather 
and uh think a lot of people have contracted uh spring fever too 
so had a lot of people out at work you know for fishing and and uh golf reasons and things like that 
the blue flu 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work i guess 
yes 
oh we have had uh as i 've said we 've had variable weather uh 
hm 
it has been untypically wet for this time of year 
hm 
and also we have a lot of green you know 
the grass has been growing 
and if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and buy a new spark plug or something along those lines 
hm 
but fortunately it rains 
and you uh do not have to go out and buy the spark plug no 
yeah 
but we 've had an unusually uh uh warm spring 
and well i guess we 're still in winter 
and uh we have had no snow 
um-hum 
no snow 
to speak of to speak of 
hm 
we usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter 
and this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation 
hm 
so it 's been inordinately warm uh here for uh for this time of year 
hm 
so uh in that regard it 's it 's fine 
but uh i envy you you 're at ninety four degrees 
um-hum 
i thought i heard this morning that in san antonio it was in the nineties yesterday 
yes 
yes 
it is 
down in uh more southern an- an- western areas 
and of course we 're um about two hours from the northern border straight south 
yeah 
and and uh very windy 
it 's amazing to me 
because i 've only lived in dallas three years 
and i can not believe that the wind blows all the time 
it does 
i- i- i 
very seldom if any 
i can n't remember you know a day that i walked out and the wind was n't blowing 
um-hum 
well i spent six years in graduate school at in indiana in the flatlands 
and it was that way everyday 
hm 
rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour summer a- and winter 
so that uh 
we you you became accustomed to it i guess 
uh-huh 
but uh otherwise w- as i said we have had a uh relatively mild winter f- speaking for this area of the country 
um-hum 
oh reall- where did you go to school in indiana 
purdue 
purdue 
i have a brother that lives in uh uh southbend indiana 
oh yes 
and i had to always 
w- i 've lived there for eight years myself 
i 'd always said i was going to go back to school and go to notre dame 
but i did n't uh 
well you are not from that area originally i can tell 
no 
originally i 'm from new mexico 
oh okay 
i was born in new mexico 
and we lived in uh southbend for eighty eight years and uh then moved to uh tennessee actually 
well 
and uh 
um-hum well i thought i heard a little tennessee in the- um-hum 
very much 
very much 
because i- i spent thirteen years there and uh then moved to dallas about three years ago 
so 
gee 
you 've moved almost moved around as much as i have 
yeah it 's uh uh uh uh 
my father was in the air force 
so 
oh i see 
uh 
well i worked for the government 
so i i moved uh much more frequently than i had intended uh for sixteen years 
uh-huh 
but i guess the uh th- this is my first conversation in this uh uh series 
oh uh-huh 
i h- i received a call last night because of the uh 
i had not received my uh personal identification number 
right 
so i had to call jack godfrey today and ask him what it was because i i had to abort the call last evening because i could n't get on the line 
yeah 
so uh is there any 
i 'm not sure how long we 're supposed to talk 
it 's um it 's just as long as you want to 
oh okay 
i mean it 's just a as long as you want to and just you know a reasonable lengthy conversation 
now uh do you work for texas instruments 
no 
i do not 
i work for gte 
uh oh okay 
and i uh of course was i was sent a uh an application from uh from jack 
um-hum 
i 've known jack for sometime 
i 'm in the speech processing business and have been for a number of years 
oh r- 
so i was very much interested in in being a speaker for this 
yeah 
oh actu- i- i work for texas instruments 
and um i 'm in a i 'm an environmental engineer 
oh i see 
and uh they just published this internally you know getting people involved 
um-hum 
so th- that 's really strange 
i i was wondering why we had somebody from maryland though 
i was thinking god do we have a ti in maryland 
or 
i 'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative 
um-hum 
and um but i have uh i have been an a speaker in other uh similar type of activities 
um-hum 
uh and i know the reason why this is why the uh this is being gathered and the program and so forth 
so i was interested in as i said i was interested in being a speaker 
um-hum 
we have n't talked much about the weather 
oh well 
i know that 's what we 're supposed to do 
yeah 
yeah 
well really it uh the the letter just says um 
let 's see i can n't 
i was looking at it 
i was trying to find out speedy short cuts 
and all it says not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and and end it when needed 
so 
um-hum 
in environmental engineering uh 
okay 
is that with regard to workplace engineering or just you know environment the work place environment 
or 
um-hum uh well it 's actually um waste water 
oh i see 
taking taking care of uh 
i 'm actually in the air division 
and we monitor um anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building 
or um we do have customers that um their concerns are in the work place 
and we take care of that 
but i- within our department we uh take care of everything waste water uh solid waste and recycling and and air 
um-hum 
well i had 
my the the call last evening was supposed to be about uh concerning recycling in the community 
oh uh-huh 
the call i received 
and so i had uh i had thought a little bit about it um uh beforehand 
um-hum 
um-hum oh uh-huh 
so i 
but th- that 's interesting 
i have a um uh a friend who is a planner uh a city planner 
oh uh-huh 
and one of his 
and he models uh city districts and so forth uh does computer modeling 
um-hum 
yes 
and one of the uh 
he has inputs or gets inputs from a an environmental engineer 
uh-huh 
yeah 
we actually our division is corporate wide 
and we take care of just the dallas area 
to 
course we have several plants here 
but um we do air modeling also 
um-hum oh i see 
and and yeah i take care of all the air modeling specifically for the dallas area 
what we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed and wind direction 
and and uh we have a huge chemical data base 
well that 's interesting 
and uh our our chemical data base so that we know every chemical on site 
and and um it 's concentration 
and and if if anything ever happened god forbid you know a building explosion or something like we 'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station 
okay 
so we 've got to talk about music 
okay 
and um do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind 
oh i guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies because that 's well no that 's really when i grew up 
no 
not a seventies baby 
so that 's really what i like better 
is that kind of music 
i mean 
is it disco 
or is it like 
no 
no 
no 
not that kind of music 
but 
no 
more like uh rock um you know like led zeppelin type 
oh okay 
so so they can get like the doors and led zeppelin 
right 
yeah 
that 's cool 
right 
and how about the rolling stones 
oh sure 
sure 
i went to their concert last year when they were here 
oh that 's when that 's when they took toured 
how about um pink floyd 
sure 
yeah 
i like the- 
okay 
so so then we got we got some of the same things 
because 
okay 
well i just did n't know that much about music 
and i was n't sure what kind of music 
no 
it 's very hard 
because see well i mean in the whole spectrum i 'd rather listen you know 
t- what- i listen to heavy metal or or classic rock 
you know what what kind of heavy metal are we talking about 
what 
we 're talking about what they th- they call hard rock 
okay 
like give me some examples 
like for example let 's see uh bad company 
what 
oh well bad company company 's not bad 
that 's not 
like well well they 're like for example ac dc 
yeah 
ac dc 
why 
have you heard of them 
yes 
okay 
and stuff like that 
that 's that 's that 's not really hard rock 
well okay 
i guess i did n't really consider that heavy metal 
okay 
i mean i i think when you say heavy metal i 'm i 'm thinking about like cinderella you know 
well cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal 
well see i do n't really care for cinderella 
but i like ac dc 's okay 
but see for example they have see what 
what other bands consider it like really hard rock 
it 's like brash metal which all they do is they have like this guitar and they just bang at the guitar 
and the guitar is set like really low 
yeah 
no 
i do n't really care for that too much i guess 
and what happens is ah everybody gets like totally into the music 
and then they start dancing around 
uh-huh 
and they just bump into each other 
uh-huh 
like like they hit each other with their shoulders 
uh-huh 
and then you knock people down 
and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people 
is that the kind of music that you like 
no 
i do n't like that music 
oh okay 
but that 's that 's what they do 
that 's that 's what some people call like really heavy metal 
oh okay 
and see the difference i guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also 
like really like heavy metal considered like the words heavy metal 
and like they always talk about like suicide and killing people and stuff like that 
yeah 
and just hard rock has 
th- they do n't talk about that 
they just talk about like life in general 
right 
like queen 's reich if you ever heard of them 
oh sure 
of course 
so 
quee- you you talking queen 
is that what you said 
okay 
then well no 
i said queen 's reich 
but but but oh no you got to like queen also 
oh oh oh oh okay 
right 
so because 
well sure 
because queen was real popular when i was growing up 
yeah 
especially uh oh god what is it a night at the opera 
do n't they have a 
no 
let 's see the one that they have the the whole opera sing in the background 
oh 
um uh right 
oh bo- bo- bohemian rhapsody 
right 
yep 
yeah 
yeah 
that that was great 
i heard that the other day on the radio 
and i pumped it up 
because i mean i just love that song 
yeah 
that that was a real good one 
yeah 
but they had 
th- that that whole record was pretty good 
but then they started going downhill like everybody else 
well that 's true 
they came up with some pretty weird stuff after that 
yeah 
they they 're still around 
they got a new a new cd out 
but i d- i would n't buy it 
because see what happens is the oldies see what 
i like i like the old rolling stones 
i do n't like the new stuff 
of the stones 
yeah 
yeah 
i agree 
that 's the new 
the older stuff is the best of it 
the the new stuff 's kind of more like today 's rock and roll which i do n't really care for today 's rock and roll too much 
yeah 
yeah well for example i used to like the old phil collins 
it 's right 
an old genesis 
yes 
definitely 
i agree 
and and then what happened was that phil collins said hey i can make money a lot of money doing this 
and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like no jacket required 
uh-huh 
that was good 
but it was on it 's way of going downhill 
because he said i can make a lot of money just singing alone 
and then he came out with the invisible touch with uh genesis 
and that really 
like now i hate phil collins 
i can n't stand him 
right 
because i look at him 
and i say you know you were singing at this time and with these people 
and you were great 
and now you 're singing all this stuff that does n't matter what you what you sing or what you record 
it 's still going to be a number one hit 
and so that 's that 's what gets me mad 
yeah 
but did did you go see that new doors movie 
that no 
not yet 
i guess i 've been con- kind of considering it 
have you seen it yet 
yeah 
i saw it when it opened 
was it really good 
yeah 
well i- it 's it 's uh you know it 's like i was watching siskel and ebert you know like those guys that criticize movies 
was it uh-huh 
right 
and they both loved the movie right 
uh-huh 
they said the music 's great 
it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that 
uh-huh 
and then one of them said well everything is great 
but i 'm going to give it a thumbs down 
and they go 
but why 
because it 's like the end is like really depressing 
and so 
uh 
an- but but it 's like but it 's like the movie is so well made 
and the music that goes with it just picks you up see 
i was never i was born in nineteen hundred sixty nine so i mean so for me 
oh okay 
so you did n't really grow up with that kind of music then 
no 
but you learn to 
i mean it 's just that like the the sixties music 's got a lot to say 
right 
i i never found out the a lot of the seventies music had too 
you know i was like 
well that 's well no 
now seventies music i mean i 'm like i said you know i do n't like disco 
i 've never liked disco 
hey 
but i bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants 
you know but well that 's true 
that 's true 
but i i was more um in the late seven- 
well i- i shoul- 
like mid to late seventies like between seventy five and and seventy nine was more my era 
and 
yeah 
did did you go to college 
um well no 
i 'm going right now 
oh that 's cool 
but um no 
i did n't go then 
but see i graduated high school in seventy eight 
okay 
so you know in seventy eight you know rock was really starting to get really heavy you know 
and real um i do n't know 
yeah 
yeah 
disco was pretty much dead by then 
yeah 
so so that 's what i mean 
disco was n't really my time 
well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in in progression ever in history 
so 
about music 
naw 
about everything 
oh okay 
so it 's like nothing happened during the seventies 
everything happened during the sixties 
the seventies i do n't know what they 're called you know 
it 's like like 
the the eighties are called like the progressive years or the or or you know like the technology years because of all the computers and stuff 
uh-huh 
but the seventies got nothing 
i mean nobody cared to name it 
that 's kind of funny 
so 
you 're right 
i never thought of that 
the disco years that 's what they 're calling them yes 
yeah 
i know 
can you imagine the uh like a big picture of john travolta and saturday night what is it saturday night fever 
him just standing there 
right 
you know but uh yeah 
that 's a good example to look for in history 
well from now on we 're going to go from the from nineteen sixty nine when they took the first step on the moon to nineteen eighties 
okay 
what happened in the middle 
do n't worry 
do n't worry 
you do n't you 're not missing anything 
so 
that 's kind of funny that 's true 
well except for vietnam 
yeah 
really 
and that 's that 's why i guess everybody 
i mean you know with 
is yeah 
it 's like they do n't want to talk about that 
so they just do n't name it 
i mean it was it was i guess it was pretty bad times 
yeah 
well that 's very true 
but 
so oh well let 's see 
yeah 
okay 
we 've been talking for seven minutes 
so 
oh good 
i have n't even been keeping track 
okay 
all right 
so um i 'm going to leave you alone 
uh what what are you doing 
do you have a family 
uh yeah 
okay 
we 're kind of i was kind of in the middle of supper 
but it 's not a big deal 
oh i 'm sorry 
you know i just left it 
no 
it 's okay 
because see i did n't see 
somebody tried to call me last night 
but i did n't have my number yet 
i just got it today 
oh okay 
and so you know it 's okay 
i i told them i 'd be available during this time 
so anyway 
okay 
alrighty 
so then uh have fun doing this 
it is not that bad 
okay 
thanks 
great 
bye 
hi diana 
hi 
have y 'all been able to do much as a family these days 
pardon me 
have y 'all been able to do much as a as a full family these days all of you 
oh yes 
we 've um been um we 've gone other you know all kinds of places 
we go out to dinner 
yeah 
we take the kids to the park 
and um you know whenever we he my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo 
or we you know we we do everything we can possibly as a family 
do you work outside the home 
no 
i do n't 
yeah 
i do n't either 
it makes a little bit easier i think that way 
yeah 
it does 
an- an- then uh you know my husband enjoys spending time with the kids you know 
he 'll he 'll take them out just to be with them 
yeah 
so h- they can have time with him an- 
so you have a break too 
right 
so and we uh we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home you know we have we try to spend like monday nights we call it family home evening and have our kids um you know have little lessons with them and you know just see count see how things are going in our family and you know teach them about their grandparents or something like that bring out pictures of them so they get to know them 
uh-huh 
and we just do all kinds of fun things like that 
an- 
uh 
we have family that 's far away 
it sounds like you might too 
yeah 
we do 
so they you know the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures 
yeah 
so and um 
right 
and phone calls that 's about about it 
yeah 
right 
and uh you know they we you know we go to the park 
or we go in the backyard an- sit down 
an- 
that 's wha- yeah that 's what we mostly do pretty simple things 
yeah 
especially since my youngest one is excuse me only fourteen months 
right 
she she 's really getting to the age where she 's playing and likes to go places 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and with you know me being at home and just having the one income you know you do n't have this lot of extra money to to do a lot of you know extra things 
that that 's right 
so you you make more fun than you know 
you know the kids just think it 's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or yeah or um you know go get a bag of m and m 's or something like that 
oh that 's a big thrill for them 
they they think that 's a lot of fun 
so we just we try to spend as much time as we can 
we you know 
our wh- our whole weekends are divi- are devoted to our children except for we might go out you know one evening or something 
yeah 
but during the day you know it 's all devoted to our kids 
and they come go to church with us 
an- so 
yeah 
that 's true 
yeah 
so 
have um have you ever been to the science no it 's called the science place 
yes 
yes 
that 's what 
we ju- we have n't lived here too long 
we went there couple weeks ago 
and uh 
uh-huh 
the kids thought that was wonderful 
oh yeah 
we 
i guess there 's science place one and science place two 
we 've only been in i think it 's science place two 
i is i 'm not sure which one we went into 
it was about a year or so ago when we went 
the one we went in had um 
the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a like a kids place area 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that really see- i mean they really seemed to go wild in there 
yeah 
yeah 
they had a lot of fun in there 
and um there 's uh there 's some petting you know like uh uh 
i think it 's owens country farms has a free petting you know like a farm that you can go to 
and the kids can pet animals and stuff 
where 's that 
that 's on plano road 
um it 's like in richardson you go up plano road 
it 's like a little bit past campbell on plano road 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and that 's a lot of fun 
oh yeah 
they have tours going through there 
and um the kids think that was a lot of fun too 
oh that does sound like fun 
it 's a little bit of a ways 
an- we take you know whenever we take them to showbiz 
or they think it 's wonderful just to go to mcdonald 's you know 
they do n't go for the food 
they go for the to play around 
and there 's another place in mesquite called monkey business 
oh that 's right 
uh-huh 
and it 's a indoor fun park 
and it has a bunch of different rides for kids 
that sounds fun too 
and parents get in free 
and it 's like during the week 
it 's like five dollars admission for child all day 
and and you said a- about plano and campbell is the petting 
the petting farm 
yeah 
that sounds fun 
i think maybe we 'll try to do that 
yeah 
yeah 
an- the one in mesquite is um scyene exit 
uh-huh 
and it it 's uh 
the kids just had a wonderful time there 
they you know you just pay that admission 
and then all the the the rides are free 
you know th- of course they have all the little video games and you know those little quarter rides you know to and stuff like that 
but they thought that was a lot of fun 
yeah 
you can have birthday parties there 
an- i think that was better than like showbiz pizza because there 's more for them to do 
because they can just do 
you do n't have to have tokens for everything 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
so they had a lot of fun 
that does sound like fun 
well i 've gotten some good ideas from you 
yeah 
i we try to do a lot of things as a family and you know inexpensively as possible 
so 
definitely 
well i think i do n't know if we 've done five minutes 
but i 'm sure that 'll be be good 
yeah 
yeah that 'll be good 
yeah 
was it good talking to you 
well it 's good talking to you 
i had a g- i really appreciate your suggestions 
oh no problem 
well take care 
okay 
b- bye 
b- bye 
okay i guess we 're on 
yep 
central america 
have you ever lived in central america 
i was n't in central america 
but uh talking about latin america i kind of i consider latin america to include central and south america 
and i did live in uh sao paulo brazil for four years 
do you do you think that that we should have given up the panama canal 
uh r- realistically i 
yes 
i do n't see the 
the panama canal that has n't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it 's not not really big enough to uh accommodate the the shipping that it once did 
and uh maybe it would be better that we let the panamanians run it 
however i think we 're certainly justified in uh our actions dealing with uh noriega in this 
well there are those that that that think that that that the panama canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military 
interestingly enough my father was who was in world war two and as uh as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the panama canal 
he had worked with united fruit company there 
uh-huh 
and they uh they in fact they had this was in uh the late twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over 
and uh he turned them down 
it it 's interesting that that most people do n't realize how small the canal is 
have you ever been there 
no 
i have n't 
it 's it 's really 
i i have n't been th- 
i 've been to been to salvador 
and and uh in fact we went back to visit some friends of of of my fathers 
that we went in fifty seven i guess 
and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite quite easily 
the thing i find interesting though is that uh is the whole colonial approach 
and and and do we do we support the sandinistas or or do we support uh you know 
when they thought uh they thought that nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the 
will you uh d- did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in nicaragua 
i i have a a little bit 
i can n't say that i 'm i i would be an expert on the on the region 
but uh certainly uh i it it gets it g- 
there you you 've got this this toss up bet- or not not so much a toss up but a a dilemma when when you want a country to have it 's it 's um own uh dominion or its free rein over its its own people 
and then on the other hand uh the uh the government in power that under what seem what seems to be popular support uh sandinistas had to a given extent popular support um starts making overtures to the soviet union and and into what we consider our sphere of influence 
and now we 're we 're in this dilemma over uh 
united states is believes in democracy and and self-determination where a- 
but that on the other hand we believe in self-preservation and uh agree with the or not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about the inf- soviet influence in in what 's considered to be the united states fear of the world which is not only 
you we used to see spheres 
but now we 're in a situation where the united states is looks like we 're it now 
well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic 
i do n't know if you read any of the history on where the panama canal 
but there was an option to build it across nicaragua uh 
and there were uh there 's a big there 's a big lake 
um-hum 
and um from a technical standpoint it would n't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in nicaragua 
but the the united states uh had some 
and i 've forgotten what the political influence was 
but there were economic ties then 
the issue of of of if if it 's in the economic interest of the united states uh do we go in and and prevail 
and and uh in other words do we make the world a safer democracy 
right 
but if there 's no economic benefit 
and i think particularly if you 're if you 're looking at the at the at the peasant uh whether he 's in central america regardless of where he is is his life is his life better off under communism or or uh or democratic government 
you look at salvador where the 
well he does n't care as long as he 's feeding his uh his family 
yeah 
and and the question is is does the government make a difference 
if they 'll mostly leave him alone uh 
and i think that 's the difficulty they that that we have that uh it it it reality does n't make uh does n't make a difference if he has no income 
and apparently even some of our alleged uh central american leaders that uh a- are that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things 
so it 's uh 
yeah 
oh you 
can look in i- 
y- p- if you look at the region and and on 
to their detriment they came from uh this uh hundreds of years of spanish control 
in the in the spaniards have a horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who uh have been uh i do n't know manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good 
i mean if you go back to the kings and then the the conquistadors coming in and and the who- the incredibly horrible things they did to the uh the native tribes 
i mean they make uh they make the things that custer did look like uh like trivial 
and uh you get 
it it 's it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation 
and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting and 
and and americans have uh have a pretty good reputation of exploiting you know 
we basically the panama canal we went in and and took it 
oh absolutely 
and n- we set up 
and uh we stole it fair and square 
i think is uh 
and 
i mean ted teddy roosevelt did n't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for uh for nothing 
and uh 
well what 's going to be interesting is to see what the economic impact of of uh of the the region uh you know 
at the moment it the tremendous drug traffic through there 
but uh the idea of of uh what 's the what 's america 's role there 
right 
and it it uh with with other things going on it it it seems to have lessened 
but you 've still got uh cuba that exception exerts some influence 
i 've the only the only thing i see about cuba though is uh after fidel castro dies i do n't think there 'll be communist power anymore 
i i can n't see communism in that country carrying on past him 
well when you take a a situation where i think in particular in salvador where there is a significant u- under class excuse me and that uh having a a a lot of difficulty uh surviving uh the question is would they you know would they be better off under communism 
yeah 
and i would n't do n't know that i would advocate communism 
but uh the question is can a can you can a can a democracy uh afford the 
it 's like the street people that are starting to show up all over the us is that that 's essentially an underclass 
right 
and when you get enough of them uh you know communism would feed them all 
yeah 
well i i do n't know if maybe communism 's the right the right word for it 
but what we would 
there 'd have to be some kind of 
there there may be a point at which a- at which you 've uh you might want to consider some kind of socialistic uh organization or socialistic setup to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy 
well that 
yeah 
if the guys got some incentive if he 's got uh you know i- if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas to uh where he 's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all 
right 
right 
then democracy of a considerable interest 
but cocoa leaves sell real low right now it seems 
yeah 
to 
him yes a- as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments 
absolutely 
absolutely i do n't 
it 's going to be hard to um 
we 've 
th- y- th- y- 
that 's that 's where you 're absolutely right as we 've got to do something in that region to encourage uh or to make to make him growing bananas profitable again i mean 
yes 
but the but the question is you know if somebody offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it 
right 
well not that we could be bought but uh 
i got to watch what i say here 
i never know when the dia maybe uh listening on my phone 
well of course all everything we 're saying is being recorded 
and 
right 
of course 
of course 
yeah 
uh it 's tempting 
it 's got to be it 's got be horribly tempting for those for those because 
particularly if you 're hungry 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
y- it 's not j- it 's not just a matter of uh of having an extra car or having a better car 
this is a matter for them of of feeding themselves their wife and their family 
and and y- 
there 's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family 
and there 's dishonor in not being able to do it 
a- 
uh starve to death is not a not a whole lot of fun either 
and that uh and and and you know when somebody comes in and offers 
oh 
no 
i think that 's one of the real problems particularly when when the uh religious organizations you know 
the catholic church has been accused of a lot of things 
um-hum 
in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves 
no- not that they 
i 'm i 'm not sure the catholic church is is is p- particularly political 
but you know if somebody 's hun- 
right 
okay uh 
my favorite show is masterpiece theater 
and it has been for a long time 
but i feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because i 've never met anybody who likes it 
do you by any chance 
oh yes 
you do 
yes 
very much 
well would n't you know 
as a matter of fact i prefer public television 
uh-huh 
and uh i have particularly enjoy the english comedies and the english mysteries 
yeah 
yeah 
i watch mystery too 
um i- is that what you 're referring to 
yes 
okay 
yeah 
that is good 
i like uh 
do you read 
vociferously 
okay 
well that 's the reason why i like both of those programs is because they 're kind of based on books 
yes 
and the plots are more uh challenging you know than the sitcoms of regular tv 
well unfortunately for us at least here in the united states we the only access we have to that of course is public television 
yeah 
and i i 'm not a great television watcher in in any respect 
uh but uh the watching 
what i do watch is uh usually news and whatever is on public television 
uh any kind of 
i also uh am very fond of great performances in in that regard 
uh-huh 
yeah 
me too 
but uh 
did you stay up late and catch this red dwarf 
no 
oh that was a scream 
uh no 
uh no 
as a matter of fact uh turner broadcasting has been uh broadcasting all of the james bond movies every night this week 
uh-huh 
really 
so i have concentrated on watching james bond movies this week 
uh-huh huh i used to like him too 
he was my hero 
in fact i like sean connery to this day 
well they 're showing uh live and let die at this moment 
uh-huh yeah 
and it is the first appearance of roger moore as 007 
yeah 
so 
oh he could never cut it 
it it no 
no 
that 's true 
i was just thinking that today he well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in the early movies 
yeah 
yeah 
he does 
whereas uh sean connery has maintained the i how would you ruddy uh look 
uh but uh oh yes 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i liked his accent too 
and he can even be in movies that are not uh uh sexually oriented 
and he still comes off great 
yes well you know he was uh when was it last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something 
yes 
yeah 
he had my vote double 
i mean the man is sixty two years old 
i do n't care 
if but uh otherwise you know we 
uh with you know pbs and so forth 
and i i particularly enjoy i do n't know whether you 've whether you had a chance to watch it on pbs but uh the series uh yes minister 
uh-huh 
uh what 's that about 
that was about a the interior minist- 
it was a comedy 
oh yes 
yes 
the interior minister of uh in england with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that 
uh-huh 
right 
i l- i 've seen it several times 
it 's a scream 
but i had to go to bed 
i have to get up and and work the next morning 
i wish they 'd put those 
that 's why i say did you stay up late to watch this red dwarf 
it came on after doctor who on saturday nights here at least 
um-hum 
and it 's just 
of course i do n't you know 
you really it was 
i do n't think they should show it on during prime time 
but still it was funny 
um-hum yeah 
yeah 
i know 
well i i 'd i as i said i 'm not much of a television watcher 
i read as i said and uh quite a bit 
uh-huh 
i i read about two or three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff 
yeah 
what d- what what do you do 
what kind of work do you do 
i 'm a payroll clerk 
just an accounting clerk 
at ti 
no uh 
i have a friend who works for ti 
and uh i work for a a tire service here in 
oh i see 
i 'm from dallas 
um-hum 
well the last two people who have called both worked for ti 
and i just wondered 
yeah 
yeah 
it could be tiers uh i think probably are participating more than anybody else 
but i needed the money 
this is five bucks here 
huh um-hum i guess yeah i- i guess we all can 
yeah 
really 
do you work for ti 
no 
no 
i work for gte in maryland 
really 
yes 
how 'd you hear 
oh we 're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we 
well that i guess it 
it doe- how did i hear about it 
well i work you know 
they 're gathering a database for voice processing 
yeah uh-huh 
and that 's my field of of work also 
huh 
so i i know the people at ti who are doing this 
and i heard about it 
so i called them and ask if i c- could participate and uh you know sent in the forms etcetera and uh so forth 
yeah 
huh right 
we could go back to television shows 
well you know speaking of public tv have you caught any of this series on the bible 
if you yes 
i have 
i 've heard that it 's really against the well i mean that it 's coming out with the idea that the bible 's not true 
well no 
that 's it 
you could interpret it that way 
uh-huh 
uh i think what they 're trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth 
but the interpretation that actually got into the um the writing of the bible itself is probably uh after the what uh was it the king james version when the committee uh did it wr- wrote the uh the or translation that so much was lost in the translation uh particularly since most of the tr- most of the translations were from greek 
uh-huh yeah 
uh well for example uh in greek there are seven different words for love 
right 
okay 
so you can have 
there 's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word word for you know l- uh love of uh your father and that sort of thing 
so in those tr- those types of interpretations uh really made a difference in how one might interpret the bible now and what it says 
uh-huh 
so that you know it 's it you know 
you can look at it as though they are saying it 's not true 
but there 's too much historical fact involved just from the uh the histories that are that were developed around that time that are available to deny that at least you know the majority of it is true 
huh 
so you know you know it depends on how you look at it 
yeah 
you can look at it if you know 
if if you want to say that it 's proving that it is n't true then you can you very much look at it that way 
i guess if you 're looking for that you 're 
yeah 
hey you could well you can interpret that the what the tv show in the same way you can interpret the bible 
but uh 
uh-huh 
well uh so 
really 
but uh i as as far as that goes i a- we at we at least agree on you know on what we enjoy 
yeah 
that 's right 
in that regard but uh i do n't know if there 's a there is a time limit on this so uh 
yeah 
surely we 've made it 
i think so too 
all right 
well it 's been very pleasant talking to you 
well it was nice talking to you 
and have a good evening 
okay you too 
good night 
bye-bye 
yes um 
i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for puerto rico 
i was a resident although very young of the s- of what is now the state of alaska in nineteen fifty nine when alaska stopped being a territory became a state 
uh so i guess i have a left over positive feeling about the question even though i do n't know very much about puerto rico 
um i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in alaska have been very positive uh 
and i k- have a suspicion that that i believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of puerto rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go 
one or the other 
what is your situation 
well i 'm i guess i do n't have su- such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do 
um my concern is the economy because as i understand it puerto rico has a very low st- uh standard of living or at least um annual average income 
um part of this i suppose is justified in i- in that the climate they do n't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of th- the more northern territories need 
however in that case i guess i would favor status quo 
i have been to puerto rico and and found it very very interesting 
i did peace corps training there 
oh that 's very interesting 
and so um you know i saw it also as a young student 
and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in california and so the spanish was no problem 
um it was it was you know very lovely 
and and the people seemed very friendly and and nice 
i have 
actually i work with uh a girl from puerto rico 
and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors uh 
your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on puerto rico or pressures on the us in terms of aid or 
well probably more on in terms of the us 
um you know i 'm i 'm not quite sure how the us copes with this sort of thing 
i 've lived abroad abroad most of my life 
so i guess i i 've been very cut off 
uh i lived actually in lebanon 
so i was very cut off from the the press as i w- you know and uh bec- was becoming an adult 
so i do n't know how the us would cope with it a new state that is so very very poor 
um-hum 
um i guess you know we 'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of like new york and and how much aid it needs 
i suppose the whole country or the whole um new state would require such aid 
um-hum i guess um we 're assuming that that puerto rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say mississippi or 
i think so 
okay 
that 's something th- that i guess i have not much of an image of other than than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess although i 'm aware of the political problems and unrest and and and also difficulties they have 
um i do n't know whether state woul- statehood would improve their economy 
i do n't i do n't know that the ve- the act of being a state would would have any impact on on them 
uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they do n't have now 
but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax 
i do n't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being since they are n't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they are n't able to tax like a typical state would be 
how do you feel though about 
well i guess it 's to their advantage to be a territory 
but uh i wonder how hav- having been in a territory but only as a young student 
and my parents were in the military at the time 
so they did n't have ready negative feelings about being in the s- in the alaska at the time since th- they voted absentee 
i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se- feeling of second class citizenry uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote 
the district of columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times in their not having a senate representative 
um-hum 
um-hum yeah 
th- those are good points um which obviously i 'd never thought about 
um i do n't know wh- uh 
i suppose they also not being a state are probably freer to determine their own um ways of life than they would if if 
i- i 'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory 
um-hum 
perhaps compulsory education um and taxes 
uh i see what you mean 
so that 
yeah 
taxes would undoubtedly be occurring 
uh there 
i do n't know 
i i do n't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation 
um frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states 
i uh and i 'm thinking in terms of education 
but then again each state sets its own 
and i do n't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico 
um it 's interesting because i had n't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to uh economy uh 
i had thought of it more in terms of political uh realization 
and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the us than an independent country 
so 
um-hum 
w- well actually i thin- 
one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they 've recently voted that spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway 
so if they 've just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me either they 're doing it because they 're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state or maybe because they do n't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish or hispanic heritage 
um-hum uh-huh 
that 's interesting 
well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo 
i i believe i would probably tend towards that 
and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these 
so i 'm ult- i guess i 'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point leaning towards uh statehood 
well that 's interesting 
right 
what about if if um they demanded to have spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood 
i think i would be troubled 
i suspect i believe that any of our states 
and i i constitutionally i do n't think there are any prescriptions abou- against that decision even if uh louisiana chose to go with creole or something 
um i do n't think there is any prohibitions 
i would be bothered by that 
i 'm i 'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of america 's strengths 
and that 's the the the melting pot 
um-hum 
uh i i- am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines 
but i 'm troubled by too close a clinging to to the the past 
and i 'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country 
um 
and canada i guess comes to my mind as they 're going through the throes up there relative to french quebec and whatever 
uh that i i think that would be a a negative step to make 
and i think that that they would need to reassess that 
um i 'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as that it intr- it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect 
um-hum 
um-hum 
that 's interesting because although i tend to be bilingual spanish based on experience uh i was in bilingual education in california 
and i did n't have any problem with my students 
but i noticed my my brother wh- who was uh quite a bit younger was learning spanish in elementary school 
and he can n't speak a word 
hum 
and so obviously it did n't work in california 
yeah 
but i 'm rather in favor of people being bilingual 
right 
and i 'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn english and a second language 
right 
but i 'm i 'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level 
oh i see 
um i 'm i 'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess 
um-hum 
um-hum 
well i think we have gone to time 
and i appreciate your having called 
o- okay 
well thank you very much 
good-bye 
uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes 
wh- um 
well um my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class 
uh-huh 
he 's an aerobics instructor and um is going to be uh entering north texas for a kinesiology program there 
um-hum 
and um the the 
how i met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach 
um-hum 
you 're a student 
yeah 
so i 'm i 'm an avid aerobics uh person and just very very athletic 
uh-huh 
enjoying a you know uh anything dealing with sports 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so and how do you feel about it 
um i 'm i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise 
i i do n't feel like i 
i do n't very often do things for the sake of exercise 
i do n't feel well unless i am exercising 
and i try to do things that involve exercise 
but i very rarely do things like um 
i 've never done aerobics or any sort of structured 
this is my exercise time but i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh you know mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that 
um-hum 
and i spend a lot of time 
and i probably get more exercise than your average person 
but it 's not a a structured sort of thing 
and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising 's sake 
um-hum 
and perhaps it 's because somehow that implies to me it 's not fun or something like that 
yeah 
well i i 've 
my 
that 's the way my mother stands on it 
she feels like if it 's something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes it becomes a chore 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yes 
yes 
and and she does n't enjoy it when it 's a chore 
so um and i feel that way too as far as y- you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know 
to 
um-hum 
um-hum 
you know a a calc- you know 
calculated down 
and and do your calisthenics you know three times a week 
um-hum 
or but but i do try and um i do try and regulate how much exercise i get a week 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
is that why you like aerobics classes because you 're not sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore 
yeah 
and it 's got 
and i 've always enjoyed dance 
yeah 
so it involves you know 
i- i can n't get out to dance all the time 
and 
yeah 
would that we could 
yeah 
and it 's and it 's more regulated 
i mean you 're you 're using different parts of the body 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so it it is like dance 
an- and it 's structured like that 
but you have the music and someone like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me 
yeah 
um-hum 
and someone else is telling me okay you know l- let 's move this way let 's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much 
um-hum 
um-hum 
right 
you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise 
and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself 
yeah 
yeah 
but i 'm like you 
i also um like to participate in uh things like 
well we just went to the uh myerson symphony run this past weekend 
and and that was a lot of fun 
and you get to meet different people and um just get out you know out and about 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and it 's it it 's something you can all 
like our 
we did it as a family 
so it was it was quite a lot of fun 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and biking 
and i- i- i love to swim 
so i love it when you know it 's swimming weather 
hm 
and uh 
well you 're talking to someone from california where it 's often swimming weather 
oh 
i did n't realize that 
uh 
i 'm sorry 
well i 'm in texas 
i- i just assumed that i had 
this is the first call i 've done 
and i did n't realize that they had were going to reach out to people from all over the country 
you would n't know that 
oh i 
so it 's the it 's it 's the the act- well it 's actually 
it 's interesting because there are rea- real regional differences 
um in california there 's uh almost an assumption um unless you 're sort of clearly of an uh an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that 
i 'm i 'm i 'm i 'm not uh 
there 's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban california 
and maybe not 
i do n't know about rural california too well 
but in urban california it 's just you know 
for all i know aerobics started out here 
i do n't know where they actually started 
but they you know the craze really picked up big here 
and before that there was the running craze 
and they 
california gets you know tends to be a bit faddish 
but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere 
um-hum 
so there must be something to some of them 
and uh 
well i think people are are more enc- 
people from california seem to be more health motivated all around i mean as far as the diet and everything uh the diet and uh just y- y- your health consciousness 
and i mean it just seems like uh a lot of those ideas generate out of california 
um-hum 
not just exercise but health health related ideas 
yeah 
and i 
i- it 's curious i do n't know why do n't know if it 's 
do you 
does california have a 
well there 's a sense of it being a package 
i think there there is a sense of you know whole 
there 's a lot of uh you know 
you 'll get organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever 
and uh oh the uni- uni- uni- the university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that 
um-hum 
and and it does n't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything 
it it 's on fairly s- solid scientific ground 
uh it 's just dispensed with these distinctions 
it says ev- all sorts of factors go into health and there 's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together 
and uh so it 's had that orientation for quite sometime 
um there 's been some progressive medical schools out here that have taken that approach 
um-hum 
and um 
now do you think that 's because they 've realized that for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they 've incorporated that into their program 
boy 
do you think the program came first or the 
yeah 
that 
there 's a 
i- i can say there 's a correlation but i could n't say which which caused the other 
they sort of dev- you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more 
yeah 
the more money they put into it 
yeah 
and 
i can see that 
because i 
knowing 
from institutes of learning like that i know that they 've got to get their money somewhere 
and somebody 's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it 
so 
s- yeah 
yeah 
exactly 
and part of it is california you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements 
and some of them fizzled out 
and some of them were disastrous 
and others of them um had an impact on the society around here 
and one of the ones that had an impact was um people becoming interested in alternate practices 
i do n't know if it was a meditation practice or sure it was you know which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh ama approved medicine 
um you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here 
and and you could have them around long enough 
and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things 
um-hum 
and before long you you get this this whole kind of gestalt this whole package of of health of health care and options and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them 
um-hum 
the irony is is it 's people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented towards doing the exercises 
and i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks 
the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers 
yeah 
last thing 
or they 're older 
pardon me 
well do n't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar- 
i- i- i sometimes think that it 's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city 
oh like everything else 
i live in a rural area 
so you know i see the 
yeah 
yeah 
the rat race to exercise 
it 's it 's yeah it 's it 's like it 's frantic to you know to uh achieve something that that a person in a rural area um almost you know does n't worry about it to such a degree but stays you know more healthier you know 
um-hum 
yeah 
well i- i think so 
as a fit person 
i mean you you 've 
if you look at cert- if you look at other cultures 
like i know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in china 
and they do n't do very much vigorous exercise at all 
but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise 
and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation and they seem pretty you know 
um-hum 
they do n't have the hard body 
they do n't have that perfect look 
and an awful lot of exercises is sort of image conscious 
but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some day you know 
yeah 
and that that 's 
well do n't you think a lot of that is diet too 
and a lot of that is diet 
that 's true 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat um for economical reasons not for preference 
um-hum 
um 
yeah 
and as we can see 
well i 'm a i 'm a practicing vegetarian 
so uh i 've read a lot of information knowing that to be true 
yes 
as am i actually 
what 's that 
i as am i 
oh are you also 
yes 
well that 's that 's good as far as the cal- 
is that is that um pretty predominant as far as california do do 
it is in the urban areas 
yes 
in the urban areas 
most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now 
um-hum 
oh that 's wonderful 
well most most mo- sort of modern looking restaurants will 
yeah 
you can 
that 's great 
i mean we uh 
it 's such a tr- it 's such a trouble here 
i mean you just have to eat at home basically 
i was wondering that 
because i was actually applying for a job in texas 
and and and uh it occurred to me 
well of course in the cities 
yeah 
well in the cities 
we live close to dallas 
um-hum 
so um which y- you know 
you get uh an influx of a lot of people from all over the country 
so you 're going to have a lot of more choices 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but in urban areas it 's you know steak places 
yeah 
yeah 
an and it 's not a you know 
yeah 
it 's uh definitely 
it it 's it 's changing to a degree 
but um it 's very frustrating and even even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or uh organic you know materials and foods and things 
yeah 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
you do n't really have that 
i mean you would think 
all right um 
i think the topic was crime in the city 
right 
i do not live in a city 
i live in a real small little place 
where is that 
uh it 's about thirty miles from sherman 
north south east or west 
it 's north of sherman 
well you live almost in oklahoma 
uh it not too far 
yeah 
that 's kind of ironic because i do n't live too far from oklahoma either 
huh 
you know where saint joe is 
uh i 've been through there 
i 'm about eight miles south of it 
okay 
oh yeah 
i had been through saint joe 
but um just as far as you know watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad 
well you know i 've i 've seen those statistics and everything 
and you know what frightens me is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry you know 
um-hum 
i mean the iraqis did n't have a lot of high-tech weaponry 
but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that 
oh yeah 
sure 
and they did n't kill as many people in in forty five days 
and they were intending to kill people 
uh-huh 
i mean that was their job as they killed in washington dc 
oh i know 
i know 
i know 
um peo- i think nowadays people just really just murder is nothing to them you know 
well i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years i guess 
and i 've come to the conclusion and this is a pretty scary thought to me even that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime rather than put them in prison because prison 's proven not to work just let them go 
say okay you 're convicted and just let them go and if they get convicted again well just kill them 
uh-huh 
yeah 
um-hum yeah 
because uh most likely that will happen wo n't it that you know 
well i think that the best hope to eliminate crime as we know it today is to eliminate the criminals from society 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
if someone is known to have been in prison they can n't get a job 
no 
you know 
yeah 
they can n't be accepted into society 
you know if they 're not going to be accepted into society then everybody 's going to become sociopathic 
um-hum 
and you know who 's to put the limit on it 
i mean i was watching a thing last night up in washington state 
if you get convicted of uh sexual offenses on a regular basis 
i mean some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions 
uh-huh 
and they 're still let out on the street after one or two years 
well in washington state if you 're a habitual sexual offender they just do n't let you out 
hum 
uh you serve your prison term 
and then you go into the mental hospital 
and if you 're pronounced cured they 'll let you go 
uh-huh 
well they may find a cure for it 
but there is no known cure now 
hum so you 're you 're kind of thinking 
in other words if you get if you do something the first time that 's not real bad you know 
you know hey people make mistakes 
yeah 
to go ahead and let them go 
but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh 
well yeah 
use that 
or you know there 's other consequences rather than killing them you know 
you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against 
oh 
um-hum 
you know 
um-hum yeah 
at least they might be some benefit in that 
and if the people they committed a crime against feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them 
uh-huh 
but uh you know with the tech- technology we have today you can put a collar on a guys leg that will knock him down if they leave the property 
i mean it will just in incapacitate them 
uh-huh 
and you can put a collar around a guys leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of you know prohibitive act 
uh-huh 
but you know putting them in prison my god that does n't work 
no 
apparently not 
because look how many years they 've been doing that 
and look 
i mean yeah 
well you look at places like turkey 
turkey has death penalty for just about everything 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
i mean if you get convicted of uh you know drug trafficking they just kill you 
you get convicted of uh you know uh heinous crimes they just kill you 
i mean there 's no two ways about it 
uh-huh 
and uh you look at their society 
and the repeat offenders are very few 
you know and you look at our society almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times 
three or four times 
yeah 
right i mean you know you know the way to stop that kind of behavior is this two fold 
that is true 
i know 
um-hum 
one you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven 
i- i think that 's very important 
oh i 'm i agree very much so on that 
i 
yeah 
and then if a parent has proved to be unfit for any reason take the kids away from the parents 
um-hum 
yeah 
because you know we are what we teach 
um-hum 
because that 's what our society becomes 
i mean we have a just a bunch of people 
comes 
yeah 
and i 've and i 've i 've lived in that that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work 
you know and these guys they come to work every morning 
and they 're stoned to the bone 
i mean their so high they could fly up to the top of that building 
and they work all day 
and they go home 
and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs 
and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money 
and then they go back to work on monday 
um-hum 
and the kids of these people 
sure 
they just think that 's the normal thing to do do n't they 
are phenomenally they 're sociopathic 
y- yeah 
and i worked in a first grade uh classroom for one full semester and these kids were more foul mouthed than i 've ever been 
um-hum 
i had one kid threaten my life first grader threaten my life 
in the first grade 
told me that daddy 's going to whoop me to death 
oh no 
you know and they flipping me the finger and all that and i just said to this kid 
um-hum 
i said you got two choices kid 
you can step into mainstream society 
or you can die 
uh-huh 
because you will eventually be killed 
and you know i just i 'm just totally a- aghast at a what 's going on 
oh i know 
i know um 
i work in school you know 
that 's huh-uh but something i do 
and i it really is 
i 'm like you 
astonishing what the younger ages know 
and they react to what they see at home you know 
um-hum 
if they see violence at home that 's what you 're going to get from the kids at school 
exactly 
you know it really is 
and that 's kind of sad 
well you can see it in the work place you know 
used to be when you had a personality conflict you just you worked with it 
and you got through it 
uh-huh 
now you know people get fired 
or what 's even worse is they promote them into a position that they can n't handle and let them get fired 
yeah 
or one thing or the other 
you look at another kind of society like the japanese 
you put that many people on that small of a space they 've learned to live together 
okay 
it 's in their culture 
um-hum 
and one of the things that 's in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while japan was becoming a great power financially the people that worked for those companies worked for the same company they worked for at sixty five as they did when they were eighteen 
teen 
and the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people 
if they were n't fit for the job they were hired for they did n't just can them 
they made a position for them some where 
huh 
uh you look at uh frito lay 
my wife used to work for frito lay as a typist 
you know transcribing stuff into the computer 
uh-huh 
well she can type about one hundred and five words per minute 
but she do n't like it 
she she just does n't like to do that 
i mean she will 
uh-huh cause yeah 
but you know her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is 
um what kind of hobbies do you have 
um i do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when i do have spare time 
really 
i like cross-stitch too 
oh i love it 
i just have a hard time finding any spare time lately 
i- that 's my case also 
i 've got a new born 
and and there 's just no time 
uh-huh 
have have you been cross-stitching long 
oh several years 
my husband is even interested in it now 
he likes to help me design um you know projects that are a little more customized 
oh really 
mine sort of he looks at the pattern 
and he says how do you get that from there to the to the material 
not that hard 
but oh its not 
i really i really enjoy it 
and once uh once you get started on it it 's just oh i just l- i love it 
um-hum 
i do a lot of my own patterns also 
yeah 
in fact i did one uh bill the cat you know from glenn county that uh was a real good one to do 
oh yeah 
it was it was tough 
but uh yeah 
do you have any others 
or is it just mainly cross-stitch 
um i do mostly that um 
not very artistic really for like painting and stuff 
oh uh-huh 
um yeah 
but now i do n't know 
uh b- i- w- i 'm still trying to get all the dmc colors 
oh really 
yeah 
i 've got the kits to to put them all in 
i do n't have them all yet certainly 
uh 
right 
yeah 
uh 
got to counting the other day 
and uh i think i have what was it two hundred 
and i got to thinking the money that i 've got invested in this is uh 
it uh yeah it can add up quick 
oh yeah 
i just i i just keep an inventory of what i currently have 
and then when i start a a new project i go through and see if i if i you know 
just buy the colors that i need of what i 'm low on 
um-hum 
right 
i see 
well now can i improvise with adding using another c- color instead you know what comes close because a lot of them are are similar 
um-hum 
yeah 
a lot of times you can do that 
think the i 
think the pinks there 's like forty two different shades of pink 
good grief 
yeah 
there 's there 's lots of pinks and and greens 
pinks and greens 
yeah 
there 's lots of shades of greens 
but the colors 
are i just love all the different colors 
um-hum yeah 
they had they had quite a few new ones come out last year that they added to 
b- but ah you do n't have much spare time either 
well not lately 
i even started a new job and trying to get acclimated there 
oh yes 
and that does take sometime 
yes we 're trying to get acclimated with the uh with having a baby 
and 
yeah 
how old 
there 's just he 's uh seven months old 
oh yeah 
and uh just into everything 
so there 's not a spare moment 
oh but i would n't trade it for the world 
i 've been trying to do some bibs for him and uh a- and work on his christmas stocking 
oh yeah 
yeah 
we missed it the the last year 
so hopefully this year he 'll have one 
yeah 
well last year he was a little bit young for having one 
uh right 
probably would n't have enjoyed it anyway 
you would have 
but 
right 
he oh he liked right if it tasted good yeah 
uh uh yeah all he liked was the lights this year 
so 
oh yeah 
oh well that 's neat that uh you like cross-stitch also 
yeah 
that 's that 's kind of strange that we got the same call 
yeah 
it to whi- 
uh uh oh i 'm sorry 
go ahead 
oh no 
that 's okay 
okay uh 
but yeah 
i 've been doing it for probably about ten years or so 
oh wow 
no 
i just started about well five years ago i think 
but but it is peaceful 
i mean it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it 
um-hum 
there 's bit off a couple of large projects baby afghans 
and got one done 
and i think the other one 's going to the child is going to be in high school before i get finished 
oh on that uh is it one of those uh afghans that i 've seen in the packages or the the s- large squares 
embarrassing 
well yeah 
i just i bought the cloth and the the pattern for it 
i did n't um i did n't buy the uh i did n't buy a kit 
oh uh-huh 
well i 've seen the afghans in the in the stores that uh are designed for cross-stitch 
uh-huh 
it 's it 's that cloth 
oh okay 
it 's called anne cloth i think 
um-hum 
and it has the borders and everything already 
yeah 
those are pretty 
number one turned out just great 
and the lady said she could n't believe that they know that i had done it in the colors that they had decorated the uh the nursery 
and i did n't even know it 
oh that 's a 
sh- i gave it to her 
and she said how did you know those are the colors we used 
i said did n't 
coincidence that was a good 
just worked out that way 
coincidence that 's great 
um that uh 
now i 've got some material to do an afghan but i just never did get around to finishing it 
um-hum 
i like those 
those are pretty 
yeah 
lilly yeah lilly she she said i said it 's for it 's for your daughter to use 
oh no 
she said i know she does n't get to touch it 
she hung it on the wall 
yes 
my uh grandmother uh made us a couple of quilts for the baby 
and i was like oh i do n't want to mess those up 
um-hum yeah 
oh there just too nice 
i mean you do n't get many hand made quilts anymore 
yeah 
oh yeah 
um true 
well i 've enjoyed this 
okay 
uh but uh well keep up the good um 
well keep up the cross-stitching 
you too 
all right 
thanks 
all 
righty bye bye 
bye bye 
okay 
uh the topic is to discuss the uh sources where i receive news 
uh-huh 
and uh for me that 's uh mostly newspaper and radio 
i almost never watch television as a matter of course 
so i do n't get news from television 
except during the war i watched a lot of cnn because it was so good 
uh-huh 
well why was cnn the on- 
of course i think saddam hussein only allowed cnn to broadcast it 
is that not true 
um 
it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage 
yeah 
um i do n't know 
i guess uh i do n't even know why i watch cnn 
i guess i just wanted more news 
it 's one of the few times i wanted more news than 
yeah 
well i know even if you watched abc nbc or or the other 
y- i mean what 's the other one uh cbs 
cbs 
they all were were tapped into cnn 
were they 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that 's the only thing they broadcast 
an- like you i listen to the radio on my job at work 
uh-huh 
and all this week they 've been having this uh a discussion about that is why uh why cnn was 
well i listen to a christian radio station 
um-hum 
and they were saying that cnn is definitely a world uh news service 
and uh that 
was 
you can n't really be sure of the quality of what you got you know 
hm 
uh we had some uh some people from our church went to israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing 
um-hum 
and i was watching on tv 
they they broadcast this terrible riot 
supposedly that was going on in jerusalem 
so we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they were n't even aware of it 
right 
and so it really made me question as to what how do we know ab- you know uh if the news we 're getting is any good 
so 
yeah 
i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably do n't affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made 
yeah 
right 
right 
but uh i c- i 'm from california 
and i can remember being in uh in these earthquakes 
and i mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed you know from anyone else 's point of view 
yeah 
but they 'd get all blown up in the news uh 
uh-huh 
well i it i find it depressing to watch or 
especially tv you know 
it 's uh 
local news concentrates on murders and things like that 
i 'm from dallas 
and uh we have a lot of bad stuff 
it just really gets me depressed even to watch it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
so then you wake up one morning 
and you 're in war with somebody 
you do n't even know about it 
right 
so 
oh what newspaper uh do you read in dallas 
uh we have the dallas times herald and the dallas morning news 
but i do n't i do n't read newspapers 
do n't you 
huh-uh 
how come 
i have find it hard to uh follow from one page to another 
it 's just something i 've never developed uh an interest in 
huh 
and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered it 's stolen before i can get out and get it 
go- that 's uh that sounds pretty bad to me 
i mean who would steal a newspaper 
you 'd be surprised 
hm 
they just come by and pick them up even if it 's just for the tv you know uh selections of the day 
i see 
i do n't know 
it just would n't be there whenever i 've tried it 
yeah 
so you 're right 
who would steal a newspaper 
but they do 
yeah 
what part of california are you from 
uh from los angeles 
but i live in raleigh north carolina right now 
that 's where i 'm speaking to you from 
oh okay 
but i grew up in la 
i work out here 
huh you work for ti 
no 
i do n't 
i work for north carolina state university 
huh 
but uh i know some people at ti 
and i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them 
yeah 
so i 'm in the computer business 
well i 
boy current events is not a good subject for me 
well 
i do n't keep up with it that often 
let 's see i 've i 've i 've never done this before 
i mean i 've never 
this is your first call 
this is my first call because i just got my password 
uh-huh oh really 
yeah 
so i do n't know 
are we suppose to 
it seems to me it says you 're supposed to talk for three minutes 
but i think we 've been talking for three minutes 
and nobody has interrupted 
well i 'd i got into a conversation last night with a lady 
and they interrupt at ten minutes 
i see 
so if we 've done our three minutes let 's just let the conversation end and say bye 
uh-huh 
well all right 
nice talking to you 
nice talking to you too 
all right 
bye 
bye-bye 
hello 
hello 
hey how you doing 
not bad 
not bad 
what 's your name 
fernando 
fernando 
my name is nick 
wait 
let me turn off my stereo here 
sure 
because i 've been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody 
really 
yeah 
man am 
right 
what time is it over th- 
are you are you in dallas 
i no 
no 
i 'm in detroit 
or not detroit i 'm in uh california 
are you 
yeah 
i 
because every time i got through i went to dallas texas 
really 
yeah 
i 'm in north carolina 
oh 
well you 're on the uh 
lets see 
on the other coast 
yeah 
twenty one 
yeah 
shoot man it 's what midnight almost 
what 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's uh 
i 'm watching saturday night live here 
yeah 
okay 
all right 
well i guess we 're supposed to talk 
what about 
credit card 
w- wait 
wh- what did how how did you get to know about the ti thing 
oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this 
and 
wh- what are you working on 
a a master 's in uh information systems 
really 
i 'm doing my master 's in in computer science and computer engineering 
yeah 
where at 
at north carolina state university 
hey 
how do you like it out there 
uh i do n't because uh i come from a lot a bigger city than this one 
and i i 'm in raleigh 
yeah 
and 
raleigh durham 
yeah 
yeah 
that area 
and it 's really small 
all all you have is like towns built around universities 
uh-huh 
like chapel hill 
yeah 
so it it 's basically a bunch of small towns anyway 
kind of quaint little towns 
but they do n't have a whole lot there 
yeah 
where are you at 
uh well i 'm in monterey california right now 
yeah 
oh okay 
so so i mean it 's like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people 
and that 's about it 
two hundred fifty 
yeah 
okay 
it it 's it 's a lot bigger than monterey is 
but we 're just uh just south of uh san jose and san francisco 
oh okay 
and it 's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city 
so so where do you go 
do you go to berkeley 
no 
no 
i go to the it 's the naval postgraduate school out here 
oh okay 
because um i was looking at at the doctorate degree in computer science center at berkeley 
um-hum 
and they 're asking like for a um gpa of like three point seven or something like that 
uh-huh 
and like they 're looking like for uh gre like ninety nine percentile and this and that 
yeah 
and it 's like 
well that 's what they look for 
whether or not they get it it 's hard to say 
yeah 
i know 
that 's why that 's why i did n't apply 
i mean it was like for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety nine percentile on the on the verbal part 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's pretty tough 
it 's pretty tough 
i 
mean uh let 's face it you know 
and you know are you did the you know 
as far as 
i found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know 
it 's what you do you know 
yeah 
so uh i do n't lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that 
so are are you going to go for your doctorate 
probably not 
see i 'm in the navy 
yeah 
and uh you know unless the navy funds it i probably wo n't do it until i 
if i do do it it will be after i get out of the navy 
when do you get out 
oh probably be another twelve years 
oh okay 
oh you know i like what i 'm doing right now 
but uh but what if they pay for it 
excuse me 
what if they pay for 
if they pay for a phd 
yeah 
nah 
they wo n't pay for it 
they 've i think they have maybe two people a year go get their phd 
because i know i know a couple of people here that work for um the army um 
yeah 
they civilians or uh military 
i think i think they 're military 
but i mean the guy is still in 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and um h- uh he works over in maryland 
um-hum 
and so he 's doing his master 's here 
they gave him like a scholarship like for a year 
yeah 
and he 's doing it in like in a year and a summer 
um-hum 
and so he 's getting that 
and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that 
yeah 
that 's why you want to join 
um-hum 
but uh this guy 
i mean you can earn a lot more money 
so you say 
i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you 've get your your you know master 's 
um-hum 
they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it 
so 
well a lot of times it 's you know a lot of times it 's not the money that keeps peo- that keeps people you 
yeah 
know they they like what they 're doing 
they you know they feel good about what they 're doing 
that type of thing 
it 's more 
but i mean i mean you 
the 
once you get your master 's you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty seven forty five thousand a year 
um-hum 
and and that 's not what they 're paying 
oh easily 
i 'm sure 
no 
well it depends on what rank you are of course 
yeah 
yeah 
i know 
well i mean like i say if you 're if you 're you know if you 're at an upper level in the rank category you know you 're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year 
yeah 
but that 's uh 
yeah 
those are few and far between though 
yeah 
it 's uh it 's like uh in ibm 
in ibm you can get certain points and uh everyone 's a manager 
um-hum 
but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money 
yeah 
i imagine it 's really competitive 
you 
know it 's like 
no 
i- i mean ibm is like 
there 's a joke about ibm which says you know it 's like uh 
all all the major companies get into a a boating race right 
um-hum 
and so ibm says well we have t- we have to have a team right 
uh-huh 
and then they come in last 
and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it 
yeah 
saying 
he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right 
so he goes have you come up with a -lution uh have you come up with a solution 
they go yeah 
change the rower 
you know it 's like everyone 's a manager 
but you know it 's like only use like one person does the work 
yeah 
so 
too many chiefs and not enough indians 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
oh 
that can be that that can really slow you down 
yeah 
that well that 's the way it works 
i mean that 's that 's why they 're having problems 
i mean everyone 's a manager 
and 
yeah i did n't realize that 
yeah 
i mean it 's like it 's like the people that actually do the work there are uh very few 
um-hum 
and then the other people just plan it you know 
it 's like it 's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for federal express where the with uh the think tank you know 
yeah push paper around 
uh-huh 
like all these people are just standing s- s- sitting around just going you know like what shall we do 
has anybody thought of anything 
no 
and then this guy from federal federal express comes along 
they go what 's that this track which it 's going around the world 
and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time 
um-hum 
and so it 's like the same thing with ibm you know 
so they have this think tank 
and they got to come up with ideas 
but see uh the the thing is that ibm is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff 
yeah 
oh yeah 
they 've got a they 've got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market 
yeah 
and a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know 
people generally go with that because they figure that the you y- you probably wo n't get fired for getting ibm material 
where 's if you try something different they 'll they 'll say yeah 
and it fails 
and you 're dead 
why did n't you buy why did n't you try something more mainline 
yeah 
well ibm does n't fire anybody 
because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job which y- you actually are like sitting around not doing anything 
no 
um-hum 
so you quit 
uh 
i mean that 's their policy 
they never fire anybody unless you 're caught doing something illegally 
i- illegal or something like that 
yeah 
yeah 
like if you 're stealing something or doing anything like that 
uh-huh 
but they wo n't let you off 
what they 'll do is like 
suppose you know like you 're a manager 
so they 'll put you into keeping up the paper you know 
uh-huh 
it 's like how much paper is going in 
and then you say that 's not my job 
um-hum 
so you quit 
so in other words that 's the way they force people out 
right 
that 's why they can say you know there 's no layoff policy 
right 
but it does- they do n't really say that you know 
you 're you 're always going to have great career conditions 
right 
yeah hey that 's kind of sad 
no 
but i mean it 's like it 's like they they have like this different policy 
i do n't know 
my dad works for them 
but it 's like ibm like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know 
it 's like they wo n't say 
no 
well they 're the standard right now 
or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of ibm a lot of times 
and the main 
yeah 
because see what happens is they have a good backup policy 
and anybody can fix it 
um-hum 
and so that 's what you 're going to go for 
yeah 
well you know that 's that 's a that 's a big thing 
and and you know it 's like for example like leading edge 
have you ever heard of leading edge 
yeah 
they are out of korea right 
what 
leading edge 
do n't they 
th- they made like uh small personal computers 
yeah 
small pcs 
are n't they 're out of korea right 
i do n't know 
i- i do n't know 
but what they do is what they did i do n't know is buy all the parts that ibm would throw away and build an ibm pc with all the parts that ibm would throw away 
uh-huh 
oh yeah 
yeah 
bec- so is it like for example you test a chip 
it can n't last seven years 
but it can last five 
ibm says let 's throw it away 
leading edge will say we 'll buy it from you 
okay 
and so that 's 
i mean they 're still around i think 
yeah 
i 've seen well i 've seen them around anyway you know 
so that 's what that 's what they do 
they buy all all the things that ibm throws away 
and they that 's why they 're so compatible because i mean 
um-hum 
and by the time you have a computer for five years you 're going to throw it away anyway you know 
most people do 
or they have to anyway 
well i mean there 's like when 
when you realize 
tea- one of my teachers got this computer and which you know 
it 's like um voice uh synthesis and stuff 
um-hum 
and he got that 
he said you know it 's like um 
i was testing it 
and it was wonderful 
and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory 
wow 
and i want more you know 
and it 's like jesus christ you know 
it 's like why do you want more 
because it 's like one second of recording 
i mean you put into a wave and you want to correct the errors in the wave 
um-hum 
takes so much 
i mean it 's like 
of course it does 
i mean by the times it transforms into wave by markov model 
and you put it in there 
and you want to correct those 
and then you know you 're trying to make the the wave smooth 
so you can approximately 
of course it 's going to take a lot 
imagine imagine what it is for us to make markov models you know 
um-hum that 's amazing 
yeah 
it 's like jesus christ 
well when you get yeah when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory they 're going to require 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
both both in terms in ram as well as uh you know standard memory or disk mem- disk base 
yeah 
so 
well like they say like nobody can get enough you know 
it 's like once you have something 
and it 's like i was watching this program on tv yesterday 
well yeah 
you find out more 
in nineteen seventy six nasa came up with three d graphics 
yeah 
right 
uh-huh 
and they were showing this like three d g- three d graphics view of like 
like those hologram 
what 
no 
no 
no 
deals like a hologram 
no this is like this is like video game stuff 
just graphics on a on a 
okay 
okay 
but the only thing was that it was just lines 
okay 
like if you 
well what d- do you think in terms of uh benefits 
well personally you know i think you know 
of course i 'm sure we 're familiar with the exact same benefit package 
and i think that uh we 've probably got one of the best around you know 
besides yeah they tend to offer ad- adequate vacation i guess 
and the paid time off is wonderful 
and uh one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the coda plan that is offered 
and i think that is just a a fabulous one 
so i do n't know if you participate in that or not 
but is n't it great 
absolutely 
it 's just a it 's just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know 
well i have to agree with that 
you know i was thinking about um importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for uh the system to find a a respondent 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed 
and i suspect that that 's probably true for everyone 
yeah 
when i was much younger it was uh less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits 
but as i grow older and my family grows it the medical benefits are more important 
and the retirement is more important 
i had never really thought of it that way 
but i guess that 's true i guess that 's true 
i 'm still young enough that that uh the vacation 's real important to me 
and the paid time off is real important to me and and that kind of thing 
but uh you know i was just as a matter of fact i just uh celebrated my fifth year at ti the end of last month and uh kind of started looking through the the book because of that you know 
now that i 'm a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what exactly what does that mean and what is the pension all about 
and you know when you 're when you 're you know in your 
i 'm only in my late twenties now 
so you tend not to think about retirement 
but uh it 's 
i guess now is the time to think about it 
so does ti have a pretty good retirement package do you think 
i think they have um a one that we need to recognize that we 're going to have to supplement ourselves 
yeah 
and that 's certainly one of the reasons that i 'm sure that they 've begun the uh coda plan 
uh-huh 
it 's certainly a a supplemental way uh 
uh-huh 
and i suppose if b- maybe in in your instance if if you 're started with ti in your early to mid twenties and happen to stay with them until you 're sixty five then you 'll have a very good retirement plan 
right 
but i had another career first and then came to ti a little later 
uh-huh 
so it 's not uh 
all by itself it wo n't be adequate for for my situation 
it 's not going to be build up quite enough 
yeah 
so i have to find a way to supplement that 
yeah 
well they just they seem to make it so easy to save 
you know one of the things that we 're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world 
but i 've got money coming out to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check 
and it 's probably not a great investment 
but if i was n't doing that the money would n't be being saved anyway you know 
y- i kind of have to trade off you know 
if you never see it you do n't spend it 
so and it 's 
i unders- understand though 
it 
yeah 
uh believe me i do that myself 
do you 
yeah 
and i disagree with you 
i do n't think it 's the worst investment in the world 
do you really not 
i- i you know i- i debate about whether it 's really good or not you know 
well it 's in terms of guaranteed return on investment 
and maybe you do n't start looking for that word guaranteed until later 
yeah 
yeah 
uh it 's shown a history that uh sure beats anything else over many many years 
yeah 
that 's true 
that 's very true 
we went uh and did a a thing through ibs which is a like a financial consultant type thing here in in dallas 
and uh one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was you know 
they work up this whole big you know proposal profile for you that ev- all the things that you need to work on and you need to do 
and then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our son 's education 
we have a two year old you know 
and and you know we can n't start saving for college when he 's sixteen you know 
we have to do that now 
and and uh they have a way that they can figure you know what you know 
and he 's two now 
in sixteen years when he 's ready to go to college this is how much it 'll cost you know 
and it 's just really scary the thought of how much it 's going to 
it 's what it costs now is ridiculous 
what it 's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary 
and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like fif- between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have you know money for his college 
and that 's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year 
so i guess it you know 
in that way at least we know that that 's taken care of you know 
we we can worry about other things 
so 
i understand that approach 
yeah 
that 's what that 's exactly what 's happening in my family 
yeah 
is it really 
yeah 
except that mine are a little bit older 
and and i 've shown them the numbers and said this is what 's going to be available 
all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you 're there 
uh-huh 
you better make sure that you 've got a scholarship 
that 's right 
that 's right 
well that 's what she said to us 
she said now do you all want him to go to a a state college or a private college 
and and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college 
and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship to attend you know 
and that was kind of our view on it 
it just costs too much 
you just can n't do it you know 
so i do n't know 
it 's it 's 
i do n't uh 
it just amazing 
it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years 
i just do n't know how anybody 's going to do it 
i know 
and boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them 
um i have a an eleven year old daughter now who 's saying gee dad i want to be an allergist 
oh goodness 
and i said that 's wonderful 
i applaud that 
let 
yeah 
me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that 
yeah 
exactly 
and then her little brother 's only two years behind 
exactly 
and he says well i do n't know 
i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian 
and i said that 's great 
let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that 
that 's right 
that 's right 
well you know ti you know ti offers some good stuff 
and then i think there 's i mean i think there 's some negatives 
but there 's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go 
i have you know all 
this is the first really large company i 've worked for i 've 
always been involved in little small you know ind- privately owned owned firms 
and so i 've never had the the big benefit package 
so i really do n't know how to compare it to other big companies you know 
it when i came on it was great see because i had never had anything even close to what what they offered 
so i 've been real pleased 
well that 's fantastic 
yeah 
and on whole o- i would say that they 're equal to uh most of our competitors 
think so 
uh i can see some some potential changes that probably are are would not cost very much but might uh make things a little easier such as offering a a smorgasbord having a larger variety of benefits 
um-hum 
but here 's the amount that that ti is going to pay for it 
yeah 
yeah 
and you can pick what you want 
and yeah 
now it 's up to you 
it 's menu selection so to speak 
right 
that sounds really good 
i read a thing 
i do n't even remember if it was in the dallas site or the inside one about uh companies allowing you 
and they said that ti was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which i thought sounded like a good idea 
you know if you 've been there you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation 
but that 's really not enough 
and you want an extra week then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay i 'm going to want an extra five days this year 
and they 'll take a set amount out of each paycheck you know 
and they 're deducting it all along 
so you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you know 
you- you 're really not being paid for them 
the money is actually coming out of your own pocket 
but it 's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know 
so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in 
and ti said that they were looking into something like that 
so 
well i could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a a standardized compensatory time for overtime 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and i do n't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that 
well 
true 
true 
uh and and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one 
or or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one uh a- as a repayment for every three to five days that i work overtime there they should give me one day 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
but it should be a standard and and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate th- uh that 's running in each department 
um-hum 
well 
and yeah 
and and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person 
and you know i see a lot of differences but from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who does n't get it you know 
but that 's and that 's that way with a lot of things you know there 
it seems like it depends on what what group you happen to be in what what you 're going to get and what you 're not going to get 
so 
well that 's for sure 
which is the same 
but but then it 's probably that way anywhere you know 
that 's 
oh i 'm sure personalities always come into play 
um-hum 
uh just in this size of organization 
well i am new to texas 
so i do n't even know what the law is in the state 
um-hum 
do you 
well yes 
of course we do have capital punishment 
and we 've you know done away with our quote fair share number 
oh that 's right 
i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper 
yes 
um you know different things 
is it restricted to certain crimes 
or just 
yes 
it 's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape this sort of thing 
um-hum 
hum 
well 
and it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know get into the system 
yes 
i know 
the one thing that i think is really sad about it as i recall from the articles that i 've read is that if if people who have been there are going to be killed 
um there 's people that come to the prisons 
and and um-hum they 're very violent 
and they want i mean they 're anxious for someone to be killed 
um-hum 
yes 
and i just i can n't see that 
th- that happens on occasion 
it sure does 
maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know has affected you personally you know i do n't know or a person personally 
uh-huh 
no 
i think i would be you know 
i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty 
i do n't know that it 's a big deterrent really 
i do n't know that it is 
i do n't know how we 'd ever find out you know really whether it is or not 
well there is so many chances for appeal that it kee- 
oh yeah 
oh absolutely 
yeah 
it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money 
yeah 
it 's really sad 
yeah 
i do n't know 
i just think um 
somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting the feeling that it right 
yes 
with 
someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know is really kind of bad 
yes 
um-hum 
yeah 
it is 
it 's it 's a tough tough question 
it really is 
and hum that 's true 
i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that 
like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it 
and there really are criminals that are hard-core and repeat and ne- never have any chance for 
oh absolutely 
th- that 's right 
oh i do n't know 
is it 
do you feel at all like it 's a religious issue 
not with me personally 
it is with a lot of people 
um-hum 
it 's not not to me personally 
no 
hum 
no 
i do n't know 
sometimes i feel 
i mean i do go to church and things 
i do n't know how i would feel about it 
but like you say if it hit you personally closer at home you would feel feel differently 
um-hum 
yes 
that 's a it 's a tough tough question 
it really is 
do you think most states have that 
or 
yes 
i think most states do have capital punishment 
yes 
um-hum hum 
but i think the us is one of the few countries that still do 
that still does it 
that 's right 
yes 
they 're only 
i was reading something about it the o- day 
i i want to think there 's only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still 
um-hum 
a lot of them had to have el- elected not to do so 
now i do n't know what they do in place of it 
you know maybe it 's life imprisonment or you know something 
i do n't i do n't know how they handle it 
bu- i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment 
have that 
well and it does n't seem like very many people uh are really 
i mean there 's a lot of people that are on death row 
oh yeah 
but there 's not very many people that actually um do get killed 
yes 
a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else 
um-hum 
so seems like a lot of people live there 
and then through appeals 
yes 
because i know they do frequently 
i mean they cover cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper if it finally gets to that point 
uh-huh 
yes 
right 
the first appeal is automatic 
so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat 
yeah 
there 's there 's a lot of you know last minute uh things that happen cause a person not to have to go through the whole thing 
um-hum 
so is it uh 
are we doing lethal injection now 
yes 
uh-huh 
that 's that 's fairly recent 
i do n't know how recent but fairly recent in the state of texas 
before that it was uh death by electrocution 
um-hum 
wh- which seems so awful 
yes 
it certainly does 
so it 's a little bit more humane 
i guess it is 
yes 
it would almost have to be i suppose 
if you if you had to chose i guess i would i am sure i would take the lethal injection 
yes 
the other one just seems so terrible 
yes 
absolutely 
hum 
it 's a it 's a tough question 
it really is 
i guess if i had to say you know yes or no i would say you know yes 
i- i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes 
well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime 
or it 's not because we do n't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison 
no 
i do n't think it 's a monetary thing 
um-hum 
i think 
we hope that it will be you know some sort of deterrent deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that 
hum 
some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless 
this may s- seem to be the best way out 
i do n't know 
yes 
easiest way out maybe 
no 
i do n't think it 's a monetary thing 
hum well um i notice that the crime rate was up in the dallas area 
it 's and it 's kind of been scary to think about it 
yes 
especially the murder rate its just gone crazy 
yes 
and you 're hoping there is something that will cut down on that 
absolutely 
yes 
i wish i had the answer for that 
everybody does 
you hate to have the dubious honor of being you know so high in the in statistics 
yes 
it 's nothing to be proud of 
certainly not 
but i you know 
we have been really fortunate 
our family has n't had any crime 
yes 
so have we been very very fortunate 
and so we do n't 
it 's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way and how they would expect how they would hope 
that 's right 
absolutely 
um-hum 
i mean you you hear of people who have um committed crimes 
and then they get out of jail 
and they go 
and they do the same thing again 
absolutely 
and you wonder why they can n't just stop it 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
so maybe you would 
yeah 
but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone 
so would i- 
i fortunately never been in that circumstance 
i hope i never am like like everybody else 
no 
i know when um 
we just we moved here um 
i from the i got a summons jury summons just like constantly it seemed like 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
but fortunately i had small children 
and i did n't have to go 
right 
and it 's not that 
i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury 
uh-huh 
it 's just that i did n't 
i hate having to be in charge of someone else 's life 
sure 
it 's it 's a big responsibility 
it really is 
and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case involving a violent crime or anything 
yes 
so would i 
that would be really awful 
yes 
absolutely 
well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh talking about this although it has been difficult 
but uh 
it is it 's a tough subject 
it really is 
i 'd hate to decide it 
but i guess um guess it 's important that we decide as a people what what we 're going to do 
right 
that 's right 
anyway well you have a good day 
well thank you 
it 's nice talking to you 
thank you 
bye-bye 
uh-huh 
bye bye 
okay 
the question was um what what is your opinion of youth uh spending a year or two in in public service 
okay i think it would be a great idea 
i 'm not sure about requiring it you know of people because people are going you know feeling resentful 
i do n't know 
but i think it would be a great idea 
yeah 
seems like there 's so many kids that do n't have any since of you know what they want to be or do 
or you know they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time 
and we sure our country all countries sure need help 
so 
um-hum 
would uh would you be more in favor of uh you know like a local uh 
my only experience with it i was in central america for a while and uh in san salvador in el salvador 
hum 
um-hum 
for instance everybody had what they called there social year that they that they had to put in 
oh really 
and basically it was a uh repayment for for uh high school education 
uh 
and most of them joined the red cross 
and it was done internally 
i just 
there was very little external 
i think possibly what uh they 're thinking about here more external peace corps type things where we 're sending people off shore 
um-hum um yeah 
i think that would be real interesting for people to do 
but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries 
hum 
and but i do n't know 
if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then may- maybe countries that are so poor that they would n't be able to really you know send children you know to do that 
yeah 
i did n't know 
i do n't i do n't know how the peace corps works 
i guess i was of age when the peace corps came in and all that 
yeah 
i was too 
i thought seriously about joining at that time 
i thought it was a fantastic idea 
did you ever get any information on it like 
i sent off for stuff on it 
but i do n't remember that much about it 
i know that they trained you in the language 
and um 
that 's that 's what i was wondering about was whether they actually 
yeah you actually got paid too while in the peace corps 
it was n't much 
yeah 
but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses were 
was it yeah was n't jimmy carter 's mama that was in the peace corps 
covered yeah 
i think so 
yeah 
yeah 
but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a certain age and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here and take them and to some other country that had different moral values something like saudi arabia where they could n't drink 
or some such thing where they could n't do that 
yeah 
you might end up with a revolution 
i do n't know which end though 
really 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah that 's that 's been interesting though the kids that have been over you know coming back right now you know 
yeah 
you wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them would actually say hey that 's not a bad way to do it 
because from what i understand from some of the guys i know crime uh is punishable just almost uh instantly and in 
i had n't thought about that um-hum yeah public hangings 
pub- yeah 
and this sort of thing you know 
so you do n't have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes 
and yeah yeah 
yeah 
i 've heard that like in china and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody you 'd be murdered them you know on the you know street 
so 
yeah 
well i guess that 's uh the price of freedom i guess is a little anyway 
the uh uh the the public service thing again 
i- i- i i guess in my own having had the whole three or four minutes to you know give it a great deal of thought here uh i- i think i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary 
but when you do that then it becomes almost uh 
or it can be 
yeah 
you know there are 
people will kind of set up their own little club 
yeah yeah yeah 
that 's true 
and uh but if you know 
the people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that 
if you start yeah 
might not go if it was voluntary 
but i do n't know how they 'd enforce it 
if it was 
yeah 
well if they went awol what are you going to do 
yeah 
shoot them 
put them in jail 
i do n't know 
send them over to iraq 
yeah 
yeah yeah right 
have a vacation in iraq for a year 
yeah i know my dad always talked about uh 
he was in uh ccc during uh 
yeah 
the depression and he was uh a rock rib iowa type republican 
and the only good thing he could ever say about uh the the whole roosevelt administration was uh civilian conservation corps 
um-hum 
he because he was in it 
he thought that was great 
yeah 
the rest of it was all hog wash 
but the that was great 
well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if it 's in their own country 
it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way 
i i 
it would take quite a few people 
i think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that 
so maybe that part of it would be helpful too 
um-hum um-hum yeah 
i do n't know 
yeah 
the only 
i 'd like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and 
well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know 
what would you have who who who would determine what these people do 
yeah 
yeah 
you know if uh you know if it 's run by the individual state 
you know like ccc was run by the army 
and in effect 
um-hum 
and the only opposition to it really was that it was you know s- starting some sort of a military elitist type you know special corps of uh cadre of people that sort of thing 
um-hum 
and uh when the politics of it get real confusing 
um-hum yeah 
really there could be um some uh scandals involved if you know it was n't people that were really fair and leaving it you know in a legal way or something 
uh um-hum 
they could send all the people over to you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to you know get supported 
or 
yeah 
well 
we 've we 've gotten to the point where you know if if if well if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know they 'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know all this kind of thing 
it would be open for yeah 
that could be a complicated too could n't it 
oh yeah 
yeah 
suppose uh well you know they they had a group of people who were construction oriented 
and they went and they they built uh can n't think of a good example a swimming pool or anything you know 
and one you can you can only build it in one place you know 
and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you did n't build one over here 
yeah 
that 's true 
unfair or something 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i think uh 
oh boy 
it 's one of those things on the surface you know it seems like a great idea 
it 's like a joke i heard once about uh elephant foot soup you know 
it 's easy to do once you find a elephant foot 
it 's it 's uh it 's the logistics of the thing that uh that that gets you going 
yeah 
yeah really 
yeah 
well it seems like there 's there 's a a lot 
of you do n't hear much on the news about young people really you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that 
but you know i 'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing 
i just i saw on the news the other night that the uh the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the cosby show kisha knight pullman was starting a 
i guess now she 's practically a teenager 
yeah 
she started some type of um national um organization for youth to volunteer like to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards you know helpful things 
and i know even like in the high schools in dallas 
there 's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a um minority you know 
um i think it was in a hispanic area 
they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers instead of they said ever- all these gangs kids could join to belong 
um-hum 
but they did n't have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know 
um-hum yeah 
so they were trying to start that out 
so if there 's people out there that are willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy gosh we ought to use them you know if their willing to do it 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's it 's it 's just the you know 
here you to the logistics of the thing again you know 
yeah 
who who 's going to run it you know 
what 
how 
oh it 's just so many yeah well like like i said at the beginning i 've got so many connections with people in central america 
yeah 
my daughter-in-law is panamanian you know 
hum 
and they have situations like like that down there where they they have these the social in some sort of way 
um-hum 
if you want to go to school outside the country and many salvadorians did they 'd go to school in cornell iowa of all places 
huh 
and when they came back they 'd have to serve this this this year 
and it turned out to be kind of a joke 
the ones i knew you know always chose the red cross because they did n't do anything and they had all kinds of uh things they could go into agricultural and you know really you know good stuff 
oh i see 
yeah 
but uh unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that red cross it was so many of them in it that at any particular chance your chance of having to do something was very s- it was very slim 
yeah 
yeah 
and so 
well we um we belong to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints which is like the nickname the mormon church 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and um the there is men and also women 
women are n't um nearly as frequent 
and also that have uh elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission 
and um they 're all over the world 
and its it is an incredible logistics 
i mean they have a training center where they teach them 
it 's called the missionary training center in utah 
and they have to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things 
um-hum 
and then they um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh 
young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months 
okay 
then that 's uh kind of a private organiz- 
right 
you know i 'm i 'm familiar with 
my instructor pilot was a was a mormon 
he was because he was a good construction uh you know in- instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible 
oh 
he had a direct connection somewhere uh 
yeah 
yeah right 
he felt that he really had an in 
so you know he things he would do with an airplane 
yeah 
but any rate that 's off the subject 
yeah 
no i 
but see they do n't get paid for it 
and um but there is funding that that comes 
they 're supposedly saving up on their own 
and the church helps them out some 
have n't 
but but you know that it is incredible y- you know 
s- i have n't seen you know um-hum i seen how they were organized in in central and south america 
yeah 
and uh yeah it 's uh 
it 's very involved 
well um with credit cards is me i i try to keep maybe just one or two 
i do n't i do n't like having credit cards for every store 
i i uh i just do n't like them 
what are you afraid of with them 
what am i afraid of 
yes 
um i do n't know if i 'm really afraid of spending too much 
i just uh do n't think that i need them you know 
i 
uh they are tempting at times 
but i i just you know sometimes i just do n't like everybody knowing everything about me you know 
so 
well that 's very can be very very true 
so and there you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so you 'll spend money 
so 
well that 's the idea 
they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it 
yeah 
uh-huh 
and 
that 's right 
see they make money off of it whether you use it or not 
absolutely 
well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest 
that 's right 
uh-huh 
i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing 
uh-huh 
that 's what i do 
right 
that 's what i do 
just a sec- 
sorry 
that 's all right 
sounds like you have a little one there 
i have two little ones 
yeah 
oh you have 
yeah 
so but 
great 
how old are they 
always want some um four and two and a half 
oh boy those are two very active ages 
yes 
uh yeah 
i 'm i 'm like you 
i i use my only use my credit card for um you know when i you know 
i just use it whenever i feel like i do n't want to write a check 
and then but i do n't charge anything that i can n't payoff at the end of the month 
uh-huh 
so 
well uh do you uh do you ever use the atm machines 
no 
i never do 
my husband does at work just to get cash out 
but uh i take the checkbook 
so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him 
and he gets it out 
and i do n't even think i know my number 
well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you do n't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
see we he could n't do without it he but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing 
oh that helps 
right 
yeah 
well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their visa or their mastercard for cash and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on 
uh-huh 
you 're right 
and that 's kind of silly 
yeah right 
absolutely 
yeah 
because they figure that that 's correct 
your defeating the purpose 
the idea is to use their money 
yeah 
and uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean i get i get at least one or two a week people to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i do n't want it 
um-hum 
right 
because i 
well i think that 's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted 
yeah 
yeah it 's like i 'd like to know where they determine that i 'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know 
well i- 
you 've already been preapproved 
and oh absolutely 
preapproved 
that 's their favorite word 
yes 
everybody in the country is preapproved i think 
i think so you 're right 
so 
well it 's interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find wow i did n't realize i had this much you know i 'd spent this much money 
that much spent 
right 
and then they can n't meet the minimum monthly payments on it 
well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own 
uh-huh 
and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem 
yeah 
it does because you 're you know you 're you know you 're just co- costing yourself more money because you if you can n't make the monthly the minimum payment you 're paying interest again 
that 's right 
so 
that 's right 
yeah 
yes 
well it 's been enjoyable talking with you 
it 's enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way 
so well 
right 
well take good care 
take care of your little ones 
you you too 
good luck 
uh-huh 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
ellen what kind of a car do you think you 're going to buy 
well as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day 
and uh i really do n't know the answer um 
i would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type sporty one but um something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things 
yeah 
oh you do want a lot of that stuff 
yeah 
well yeah 
i like i like some of those things 
they come in really handy 
what kind of uh things are you going to consider you know 
what uh 
you said something about the about the well what do you call them you said amenities that they have 
amenities 
but what about um their reputation of the company or the price 
um 
well of course i guess uh price is always the big consideration 
but 
it is for me 
other people do n't seem to have the same problem 
yeah 
well that 's that 's a big one in my book 
yeah 
but uh um i have preferences for uh for some um makers over others um 
and i would sort of like to buy american 
yeah 
but you know i 'm not so totally hung up on that that i would n't buy something else 
how about you 
well um the last car we bought was american because of because of that reason 
but have not been entirely happy with um several things about the car 
it does n't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be 
oh really 
because several things minor things sort of 
but still they cost us money um that we did n't feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new you know 
um-hum 
we bought the car new 
and after um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch 
oh 
and they just said well you know clutches are disposable 
and i said since when 
yeah 
brake pads are disposable you know 
yeah 
we know that 
but i never thought a clutch was disposable 
yeah 
i would n't have thought so either 
yeah 
so that was that was kind of a shock 
oh 
yeah 
i- i guess there 's a lot to to think about when you 're trying to make that decision 
yeah you know 
the less actually the less you spend on a car 
it seems like luxury cars they 're called luxury cars even though they 're much more expensive like like uh um a mercedes benz they do n't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable 
right 
you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a mercedes especially not after two years 
no 
but then 
um no 
but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune 
really 
oh i do n't know 
yeah 
i 've uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh mercedes 
um-hum 
and even though they do a lot of the work themselves then just buying the parts and everything is is pretty expensive 
but for them it 's it 's sort of a hobby too to own them 
yeah 
what kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying 
or like what things are you looking at 
well i have n't rea- really gotten that far with it um 
i 've always sort of liked general motors a little bit better than some of the others 
um-hum 
but uh oh i guess i really do n't know 
how come 
i 've been kind of um 
i guess the commercials are getting to me the toyota commercials 
yeah 
and i know that a lot of people i 've i 've known that have had toyotas have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all 
yeah 
that i think that 's 
i think they have a really good um quality 
um-hum 
my uh daughter has owned two different ones 
and uh you know we 've had some work done on them 
but it 's not too bad 
and the reason one of the reasons we um bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years 
and he lived way out in the country 
so he put a lot of miles on it 
um-hum 
and you knew it had had been through a whole lot 
um-hum 
and yet you know it it held up pretty doggone good 
so i thought they would 
yeah 
they seem to be really durable 
yeah 
so i do n't know 
i 'm i 'm not ready to buy a new car yet 
but i do n't know if if the next time i 'm going to try to to stay with buying something american or if i 'm going to go for a little more what i would consider to be a long-term investment 
yeah 
well and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know 
you 
oh it 's easy to get gas mileage in this car 
yeah 
it gets excellent gas mileage 
yeah 
that 's one of the big throwing cards for some of the foreign ones 
um-hum 
well we talked long enough 
i think so 
okay 
well enjoyed it 
all righty 
thanks 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
alrighty 
uh i 'll just hand it off to you 
and hobbies in our spare time is what we 've been selected to discuss today 
well uh the hobbies that i pursue in my spare time are crafts 
and uh i 've been involved in making uh hat stand and uh rag dolls and uh different type hats with um flowers and roses you know and uh that kind of thing straw hats and all that kind of stuff 
hm 
and i enjoy it 
it 's relaxing 
and you kind of get absorbed in it 
so the time goes by you know before you realize anything 's going on 
and i play the organ sometimes uh just for my own satisfaction not for anybody else 's ears 
because i 'm not that good at it 
but i like to bang the keyboards once in a while 
oh really 
how about yourself 
well oh hobbies gee whiz 
i guess i got too many hobbies 
so i never have time to deal with them 
really 
i like photography a lot 
oh yeah 
that 's neat 
uh i used to do that a lot 
and then i like um 
we have a new child that 'll be a year old here next week 
so i 'll take a lot of pictures of her you know and spoil them 
oh that 's great 
uh-huh 
first one you know how that is 
and um uh i play the guitar and a banjo 
i mainly play the guitar a lot you know 
i play it about every night 
and um i really love that 
if i had a druther 
if i could 've if i could make it on the road i 'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something 
because that 's 
i 've 
oh that sounds nice 
i like bluegrass too 
yeah 
i 've done it before and when i was in h- in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it 
uh-huh 
and and it 's really a a blast 
my wife hates it 
but that 's the way life is i guess 
that 's the hard part right 
exactly 
if you can do things together that really helps a lot 
uh the well yeah 
we uh 
she 's uh into the aerobics 
and uh an- and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half 
oh well that 's good too 
and that went over real well 
uh-huh 
but uh that 's about it there 
oh it 's good 
and it 's healthy too 
oh yeah 
yeah 
we do that too 
we have a uh a treadmill and uh a bicycle and that kind of stuff 
we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week you know 
oh that 's great 
yeah 
that 's great 
and we like movies 
yeah 
yep 
that 's uh 
spare time 
with a child it 's kind of stre- 
she 's 
we have uh 
we 're looking for a baby sitter 
so we 've been out twice in o- in this year so far by ourselves without the child 
uh-huh 
so it 's kind of uh become an issue you could say 
sure 
um hobbies 
i like messing around in your house building things and you know put cabinets up and those kind of things um 
oh yeah 
that 's great too 
uh-huh 
yeah 
we did some remodeling when we bought a house 
we built put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering 
that 's fun 
it 's really kind of fun 
it is 
it really is 
especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty 
yeah 
yep 
exactly 
i like things that uh you know two people can do 
but i like the quiet of doing things away you know 
kind of gives you some space for yourself 
and that 's what i find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that i can create 
and i like to crochet and knit 
i made some afghans and that kind of stuff 
i like doing things with my hands 
uh-huh 
sounds like it 
that yeah 
do you like to cook 
yes 
i love to cook 
yeah 
i love to cook too 
i 'm a 
italian food 
oh really 
yeah 
pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff 
well we 're all skinny farts 
so i 
it 
so when it comes 
i like to cook and eat and to have m- mainly i guess i get the 
yeah 
enjoyment out of people eating it and saying man this is really good 
uh-huh 
yeah 
it is 
um um but it it just 
work in the garden work around the yard o- course 
do you do barbecues 
yes 
w- we sure do 
smoke them and 
for uh uh uh smoking and all that stuff 
oh yeah 
all that hoe down stuff 
yeah 
yep 
yeah all that stuff that 's bad for you 
i- i lived in abilene for a little while and uh worked in the abilene plant 
oh sure 
yeah 
and we used to go to joe allen 's barbecue 
and oh that was great 
oh yeah 
really great 
that 's uh only way to do it 
they have some nice stuff down there 
i miss it 
well yeah 
it 's uh it 's uh it 's uh 
there 's uh there 's pluses to everything 
oh yeah 
but yeah it seems like there 's just so many things to do down here 
i like the sports 
side i play a lot of racquetball 
oh we did hor- i- i did horseback riding too 
in fact when my children were growing up we always had horses 
and uh that was kind of for them 
but they were n't as interested in it as we were you know 
so uh that was a real 
i 'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know 
we always had horses around 
and i really enjoyed that 
oh that 's great 
sound like you 
and i was disappointed when i went to texas 
i did n't see that many of them 
horses 
yes 
yeah 
you really do n't 
yeah 
th- there 's 
a you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete uh 
i know 
i know 
it 's true 
there 's buildings and concrete and a lot of people 
and that 's about it down here 
and it 's 
uh-huh 
uh yeah 
but uh that 's great 
well sound like you have a lot of nice hobbies there 
yeah 
you too 
you too 
well great 
well look uh 
i know it 's probably late for you 
okay 
uh enjoyed speaking with you have a good weekend 
me too 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye now 
okay 
i do n't know 
which end do we push 
but okay 
okay 
well um let 's see 
i i think uh there 's a lot of people that do n't vote because they do n't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard 
and you know there 's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the united states 
and that you know 
their vo- votes not going to make that much difference 
and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in 
and that person is going to have a lot of uh 
since there 's so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them 
right 
yeah 
so it 'd be really difficult to have that one pers- perfect person that believed exactly what you believed 
that 's true 
you know a lot of people uh uh 
i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the party uh the party type followers the guys that uh you know follow the party lines you know 
and they you know just go in 
hum yeah 
and if they 're republican they vo- r- vote republican every year you know 
and uh the people that are independent you know are the ones that do n't uh do n't really uh show up every year because they can n't seem to to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's good 
yeah 
i always thought 
it was back when anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and he 'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes 
but that did n't work 
yeah 
yeah 
there 's uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the democrats 
they 're real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um the democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of 
it would be the other way that the republicans were real liberal minded as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things 
um-hum 
but 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's uh 
and and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote 
um-hum 
they they each think that uh if more people vote they 'll get more votes 
yeah 
i 'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it 's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know 
yeah 
that 's that 's true 
i think in uh the texas governor election i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time 
yeah 
well that uh 
that 's so- i i know that there 's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a pr- pr- predominately catholic type area 
oh really 
and when things start uh 
when when abortion comes on the issues then people just get all inspir- inspired you know 
right 
and uh still on the other hand we 're also uh 
this particular community is a catholic community 
but uh uh down in dc where where things are a little bit different uh you know it 's it 's women 's rights and the a- and that sort of movement 
and so it 's uh quite the opposite 
so elections start getting very uh 
the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones 
um-hum yeah 
that 's true 
but uh 
and uh yeah 
that 's true that the different places in america that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place 
yeah 
i can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in dc are like controlling things for the the midwest 
um-hum 
and uh it does n't matter who they put in office they 're going to fall subject to uh the pressure that lobbyists can put 
right 
yeah 
and it 's uh real true that uh y- you know they 'll say one thing to get elected 
and then once they do get elected they do n't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand 
well right 
you know maybe it just was n't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing 
you know that 's uh 
with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to even try to do 
yeah 
yeah 
well i do n't think he 's going to have to worry about that next year 
i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected 
right 
uh 
right 
after the war 
uh-huh 
that really uh 
unfortunately that 'll probably even drop lower the voters turn down even mo- uh turnout even more because more democrats will think that they do n't have a shot 
so they wo n't even bother turning out 
uh that 's true 
yeah 
they 'll just say oh well you know the republicans have this election 
we 'll see you in four years 
right 
yeah 
uh but yeah i hope some of the local 
well that 's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with i- with old-fashioned values are the ones that are n't turning out at the at the booths 
they they say that these older voters that uh you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country 
so they they do n't come ou- turn out to vote 
and they 're the ones that uh you know really know what 's going on have the experience and -ve seen you know how politicians can you know screw up or whatever 
um-hum 
but i know my grandmother has n't voted in years 
right 
that 's 
right you know neither has mine as a matter of fact 
and uh that 's true 
they i think they look at it as well everybody the majority of the people think this way when that 's not necessarily true because you know that 's what the media says 
well the majority believes this way 
so uh they do n't even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions 
so that 's that 's true 
um-hum yeah 
wonder if they 're going to take into account with this computerized uh this computerized conversation that there 's little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking 
yeah 
do you hear the dogs in the background here 
no 
i can n't hear them 
okay 
they 're 
the children next door just opened the fence 
and they went off 
oh yeah 
yeah 
but anyway that 's 
i guess we 've uh talked long enough 
and that was sort of interesting 
yeah 
what part of the country are you from 
uh washington dc 
are you really 
um-hum 
wow 
this is 
i 'm in from 
this is dallas where i 'm at 
oh okay 
the outskirts of dallas 
well i figured with texas instruments they 'd probably have a few uh texans on the line now and then 
yeah 
do do you work for ti in any way 
no 
huh-uh 
wow 
how did you how did they get you 
uh basically they they went through engineering companies 
or oh 
and uh we 're communications 
i w- i work in a communications company 
oh okay 
right 
i work for ti 
so we saw it on the uh the t- news one day 
and i thought wow that might be interesting 
yeah 
yeah we sort of different 
yeah 
they called me at uh ten oclock one night 
that was very strange 
well yeah 
i guess they were doing it eastern standard time 
i was like 
well i do n't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes 
yeah 
central standard time 's what they 're doing it by 
so i yeah 
yeah 
i still have n't figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet 
but i did n't study it that hard 
so maybe i 'll figure it out 
um-hum 
but anyway it was nice to talk to you and uh sort of meet you 
and that was an interesting topic 
okay 
yeah 
okay 
well if you 're ever in uh dc can look up wayne sherman you 'll say oh yeah talked to that guy 
okay 
i 'm i 'm kyle hunt too if you ever come to to dallas area 
okay oh 
okay 
well we live right by the airport 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
so do we 
oh okay 
yeah 
right next to dulles 
yeah 
all right well i 'll talk to you later 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye 
here goes sharon 
okay 
well what do you think about nolan ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars 
that 's the only thing i found out tonight 
oh you found that out tonight 
yeah 
i had n't even heard that 
that 's great 
i think he deserves every penny of it 
yeah 
but there are some others out there that i do n't believe deserve the money they 're getting 
well is n't it funny how baseball 's getting less than like football players would 
oh yeah 
wonder because football 
and they play a lot they play a lot longer season too 
and a lot more games right 
yep 
that 's exactly right 
uh-huh 
but i think let 's see 
the teams that were there last year were see somebody from california 
i do n't even know who won the pennant last year 
beats me 
i mean i know yankees have won a lot of games 
yeah 
through the years 
not lately though 
we have been talking about this 
i tried to call earlier 
uh-huh 
and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from 
then i started cleaning 
and i do n't know where i even put that paper 
threw it away 
i yeah 
i was just cleaning and throwing 
oh gosh 
let 's see 
the teams that 
i think the a 's were in it last year 
the oakland a 's and i think it was i do n't think it was an all california baseball 
well have you ever played baseball 
i play softball 
well that 's what i did when i was growing up 
yeah 
that was fun 
yeah 
that 's fun 
that 's a whole different sport 
uh-huh 
yeah 
let 's see 
but i think i think the rangers need to go 
and i think the pirates will go 
and uh let 's see 
rangers have got a new guy this year 
i do n't remember his name either 
do you ever go see the rangers 
every once in a while i- i like to go on the nights when there 's not anybody out there not very many people out there 
it 's a lot more fun when you 're not fighting a crowd 
yeah 
i think it 's fun 
i like just looking at the billboards 
yeah 
but 
sometimes when i if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun 
yeah 
it 's nice at night 
yeah 
that 's when i 've been 
it is 
well 
and and do you know anything about that new stadium 
have you seen all those pictures that they 're going to put out there 
no 
yeah 
that that huge 
it 's suppose to be a huge stadium 
and it 's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it 
and uh they 're going to try to make it a real community center out there 
of course 
and you 're going to be able to buy your 
what was no wait what was it about the liquor 
that 's that 's in uh texas stadium where the football players play 
was that oh yeah 
see you 
and they 're never going to let liquor in there 
just well they 're trying 
i know 
but they try every year 
and every year they get thrown out 
it 's so stupid because they let you take it in there 
but they do n't they do n't allow you to sell it do n't allow them to sell it there 
uh-huh 
but uh that new stadium 's going to be real nice 
and i heard that there 's uh that you can bid on that stadium 
last night on the news i heard they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you 
it 's 
kind 
of right 
going to it 's going to go to the highest bidder 
oh well that 's the way to do it 
so yeah 
so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame 
you hear that 
that 's my kids turning on their music 
oh 
let me see holly turn it down 
i think it 's the bartman the simpsons 
oh god i stay away from them 
i wish i could 
i bet you do 
yeah well where are you 
in plano 
okay 
i 'm in garland 
oh you are 
yeah 
my h- my husband teaches in plano 
oh what 's he teach 
c v a e 
uh-huh 
so what do you do 
i teach 
but i teach for dallas 
oh you do 
for right now 
i 'm trying to get out 
is that a tough system to be in 
uh-huh 
real hard 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i would think it 
i mean it 's good because they they try new things you know 
but it 's like they 'll try something 
and then they throw it out and get something else you know 
yeah 
and you get tired of that 
that 's typical bureaucracy though 
that 's that 's i think it 's going to be any where you go 
it 's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones 
yeah 
i do n't know 
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad 
well but they can n't be though 
they do n't have as much money 
yeah 
most the time 
but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes 
oh man but in dallas you do n't even know who 's in in administration 
there 's so many of them 
you do n't even know who to payoff huh 
i mean somebody walks in the classroom 
and you do n't know what they 're there for you know when they 're coming how long they 're going to be 
yeah 
oh how funny 
you know it 's just them there they are 
and they 're writing the whole time 
no communication whatsoever 
no 
i had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything 
and i finally got to where i go okay i 'm debbie moore you know may i ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for you know 
yeah 
because you know you never know where they 're going what they 'll report 
or 
i know 
and they 'll tell you they 've written something down 
and you hope they 're telling you 
and you have n't you and you never see it 
no 
huh-uh 
that 's got to be frustrating 
oh it is 
how long have you taught taught dallas schools 
uh this is my eleventh year 
ooh that 's about uh ten too many 
no 
actually it 's 
now my job 's good much better than a lot because i 'm chapter one 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and all i do is teach reading all day long 
oh 
and it 's just ten children at a time 
well that 's not bad 
no 
it 's good 
and you 've got a lot of federal money too 
but has n't it changed a lot over the years 
teaching 
yeah 
oh yes 
or working in the system 
yes 
when i first started teaching i remember i went up to my job 
and i said okay i want to see a curriculum guide you know 
so i 'll know what i 'm suppose to teach 
and they go we do n't have one 
of we do n't even know where one is 
oh god 
and i go okay i mean you just you did what you wanted to do 
oh how funny 
and now they tell you what to teach and how long and you know what day what period 
yeah 
you do n't know which is you do n't know which is worse 
yeah 
no 
i know which is worse 
yeah 
i guess so 
yeah 
being told what to do is worse 
um-hum 
so how long are we suppose to talk for 
well you can talk for ten minutes 
but you do n't have to 
oh you can 
yeah 
and no 
if you talk to ten then they come ov- on and say oh you 've extended your limit 
and please say good-bye within the next five seconds 
oh i have n't ever talked that long 
well you know i had n't either till last night i was talking to this retired administrator from cleveland ohio 
oh 
we started talking about gangs you know 
how funny he lives in cleveland 
yeah 
wow 
and everybody else that i 've talked to has been right around here 
yeah 
but she was real interesting 
huh 
and then tonight this woman called 
have you taken any incoming calls 
the yours is my second one 
okay 
so hers was the first one i got gotten 
and uh oh she was telling me all her problems 
and it went over ten minutes 
did she did she did you all not talk about the topic at all 
well yeah 
we did 
but the topic was boring i thought 
oh 
what would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party 
oh gosh what was i 'm trying to remember oh the other 
the one i talked about the other night was good 
it was um about movies you know who what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that 
oh yeah 
i could go on and on about that 
me too because we go all the time 
the guy i was talking to never goes 
he was boy it sounds like your really up on this 
and i said i see at least two a week 
ooh neat 
so that was real good to talk about that 
have you seen like uh silence of the lambs 
no 
you 've got to go see that 
the last one i saw was dances of the with the wolves of the wolves 
yeah 
we talked about that one too 
and he he said he did n't think it should of gotten all those awards he thought it was too long 
but i 
oh i enjoyed it 
i did too 
i mean it was just more for my money 
yeah 
i did n't think it was too long at all 
um he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch 
huh 
the other one you need to go see is sleeping with the enemy 
uh-huh 
and how old are your kids 
one is eight 
and one is eleven 
you probably do n't want to take them to see silence of the lambs 
it 's it 's not it 's not too cool for kids 
they usually pick their own 
i bet they do 
you know they 've got it all figured out 
yeah 
they want to see all the horror movies 
well and ninja turtles 
yeah 
ninja turtles got to have those 
but most of the time really we watch them on the video 
oh yeah 
you bring 
that 's 
do n't you 
just massive rental 
well heck that 's a lot cheaper then uh taking them out to the show 
going to 
i know 
especially if you get them for a couple of nights you do n't have to watch them all at one nigh- one time 
that 's what we do especially when it 's bad weather man just plug it in 
yeah 
of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything decent 
i know 
it 's good when you go to tom thumb though 
and they 're cheap 
and nobody 's got them yet 
well that 's true 
unbelievable 
that 's true 
we saw um heroes has always been cowboys tonight 
uh-huh 
it was okay 
it was kind of slow 
and i felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know 
it just it 
and i do n't know 
it one of those movies it 's not going to be around long 
it 'll be a dollar movie in no time 
do you read 
not very much 
no 
no 
i do n't have the patience to read 
see i do that to make myself go to sleep at night 
yeah 
oh my mom and dad read all the time 
you saw field of the dreams right a long time ago 
yeah 
sure did 
so i was reading the book 
and it 's called shoeless joe 
oh really 
it was so wonderful 
and then i was um i decided well i like this author 
so i got a uh book of his short stories 
and that 's been real good 
who 's the who 's the author 
do n't do n't ask me 
oh 
the ghost of shoeless joe was the name of the book 
shoeless joe 
was it like the movie 
yes 
okay 
quite a quite a bit 
but you know in the movie the guy was black 
right 
he was n't in the book 
huh 
that 's one difference 
there really was n't a lot of difference 
i did n't 
uh see i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie 
that 's interesting 
that was a good movie too 
um-hum so well do you think we 've covered baseball 
i think so 
okay 
well have a good n- 
okay 
i 'll let you start first okay 
okay 
we um i 'm presently living in a house uh 
first time uh 
we had the house built 
and so this is our our fifth year in it i guess 
and uh um it was a really excitement to uh to go out and select a house and have one made and built 
and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses 
and um as we did with probably ninety five percent of the people here in dallas fort worth we bought a fox and jacobs home 
and they 're good for about five years or four years 
and after that they start falling apart 
so i would um not recommend f and j house for my dog to live in uh because they 're overpriced um 
but they 're a cheap house 
if you can n't afford something good you know 
they 're good for that 
and um you can call it a home because it 's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head 
but as far as the costs for what your getting uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it 
how about in your case 
well in my case my husband is not a carpenter 
but in fact he 's in electronics 
but he knew the only way we 'd ever have a new home is if he would build it 
so it took him about two and a half years 
but uh he built us a house 
it 's uh 
we have thirty two hundred square feet 
and it 's a brick house 
and pricewise it was n't great because he did it all hisself you know 
so that way he could we could kind of control in control it 
um-hum 
and um we live in kind of a small town 
um-hum 
and i mean it 's nothing fancy you know 
it 's it 's a house 
it 's nice 
and it 's real pretty 
and we 're all comfortable in it 
well that 's great 
that 's great 
that 's uh 
i 've heard 
i have another gentleman friend of mine who uh who had a house built 
matter of fact another guy 's building one now 
he 's been doing it for three years 
and the city 's a little upset with him 
but i understand you save a lot of money off uh by doing that 
and uh 
oh you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else 
nothing wrong with that 
you know 
uh i 'll vouch for that 
um 
so but uh of course my husband did everything except 
my brother 's a trim carpenter 
and he came in you know and did the inside for us 
and that helped 
that was a big savings 
a- and uh 
yes 
and uh we had to hire course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know 
he did everything else we 've been in it six years 
well that 's great 
we- have you been in it long 
oh really 
well have you do you have any plans to uh maybe um expand or move onward 
n- no 
we- 
well uh our kids are kind of still small now 
and we had thought before when they get a lot older we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it 
but he will not build a second one himself because he says agewise he 'll never be able to handle that again 
i see 
well 
first one 's always a bear 
yes 
yes 
we 're having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us 
and uh that can basically be be be put on any lot in any state any coun- you know 
so that 's kind of the we just got with him and told him what all we wanted 
um 
uh-huh 
and he 's charging about a buck a square foot to design it 
and he 's r- certified and registered 
so at least we know we 're it 's not going to fall in or something if it 's built 
yeah 
oh 
but uh i have heard that your approach is is is right 
you can actually go out and sub it if even if you do n't want to get hands on 
uh-huh 
you can even just sub it out the concrete and those kind of things 
and and that 's kind of the plan i have 
so um uh 
yes 
everyone i talk to uh i 've i file in my little book and do other things with it uh 
that 's great 
that 's great 
but uh like i said otherwise you know a th- the expense 
but you know we could not had one as large as we have if you know we had n't did it ourself 
sure 
i can imagine 
yeah 
i mean it 's not a eldorado house or anything like that 
but you know it 's ours 
if your happy with it that 's all that counts 
that 's right 
that 's right 
that 's o- 
only uh you only have to uh satisfy yourself and no one else 
a- apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high 
ooh and that 's uh that 's uh a a encouraging sign if you ever want to resell it i guess 
is n't it 
it really is 
because i i 'm always shocked at about you know what they 've g- have it appraised at 
i think oh my goodness 
a lot of money i bet well that 's great 
well yeah 
i guess that about does it 
okay 
and it was nice talking to you 
nice talking with you too 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye 
hi 
how are you doing 
uh 
i could n't hear you 
i said how are you doing 
i 'm doing fine 
i 'm just uh editing a spreadsheet right now 
i 'm trying to figure out how i can retire without having to work -til i 'm ninety five 
yeah 
we 've been doing that too 
we 're trying to retire in our fifties 
yeah thi- yeah 
this is a a very appropriate topic for our uh conversation today because what i 'm figuring out is that i 'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what i 'm making 
good luck on that one then 
what 's that 
i said good luck on that one then 
well we 've got a pretty good situation uh my wife and i since our property 's already paid for 
you know the main things that i like about the uh the job benefits would be the uh the availability of the health insurance and the availability of uh you know being able to transfer around inside the organization without having you know when they cut off a system and they do n't just can everybody that 's working on it like some companies i know of 
uh-huh 
you know they give you an opportunity to transfer into uh an on going project 
so you work for ti then 
you can n't say 
yep 
yep 
what 
yes 
you do 
well i work for disd 
and i do n't know what you 're talking about when you say um health insurance 
but dallas does n't pay 
it pays most of mine you know 
now after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it 
but then for the the family you know m- i put my kids on my policy 
it 's like two hundred dollars and it 's gone up quite a bit 
um-hum 
and they predict you know of course it 's going to keep going up 
i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage at some point 
and benefits you know 
i 'd like to see child care paid for or or on-site ch- child care sometime 
i think that would be an 
well 
excellent idea and would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their kids were being taken care of 
they could go visit them during the day 
right 
yeah 
that 's uh that 's something i had n't really thought about since we do n't have children 
but i can see how it would be a real benefit 
those 
that do 
well we can shelter also monies that we 're going to pay in for child care too 
you know go on and pay a lump sum 
and as long as you pay that amount you 're okay 
but if you paid in more than you actually used and the same thing for insurance what you predict you 're going to be paying for insurance as long as you pay actually pay out that amount of money you 're okay 
but if you pay out less then you lose that money 
hum 
i do n't like that part 
but you do n't have to do that option if you do n't want to 
well that can i can see where that might be important 
and then we got that cafeteria plan 
do you have that 
no 
no 
i i do n't know what you 're talking about 
you can uh 
well you 
let 's see it sh- it shelters you 're money that you pay for insurance 
it takes it out of your salary before taxes 
there oh okay 
yeah 
yeah 
we got that 
okay 
pre tax insurance 
yeah 
yeah 
but we call it the cafeteria plan 
i wonder why 
hum 
i said i wonder why 
oh it 's probably what the first guy who did it called it 
cafeteria 
yeah 
he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it 
maybe 
so let 's see what else can we do 
changes 
i 'll tell you what we could do 
what 
we could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired because you know 
um-hum 
you mean like for health insurance 
i- well no- not only just health insurance i mean for the whole benefit of the company 
see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job 
yeah 
okay 
now if we get somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company and they 're not doing their job or they 're not capable of doing their job then we should find a a place to put them or b you know boot them out 
well that 's easier done in a company than it is in uh school teaching 
well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they 're getting paid 
thank you 
what 
i said thank you 
oh 
we 're both school teachers 
well i 'm i 'm 
but it 's hard to get rid of a teacher if they 're not good 
i know 
it 's almost impossible 
well there 's two schools of thought on that 
you know i i 'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a professor i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that but once you get that job with the university then you 've got ten years of probation 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
then you have tenure 
and they can n't fire you 
well you know in a situation like that i do n't know if that 's good or bad 
i do know that i 've had tenured professors that were just sorry 
right 
and i 've also had tenure professors that were the best things on two legs 
well they did away with tenure in teaching a long time ago you know f- in the public schools 
but in addition 
it made you ea- more at ease 
you know you knew you were n't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous 
um-hum well they they really can n't fire you without cause 
anymore i mean you know the government 's taken care of that 
but uh what i 'm looking at is you know there are a lot of teachers out there that are n't getting paid what they need to be getting paid 
and there are some teachers out there that are n't worth having around as janitors 
right 
you know and i could see a point protecting someone 's position 
but on the other hand i do n't think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have a a degree at all 
well they do n't 
well 
in some places they do n't 
in some places they do n't 
do they 
but you know you you 've got specialized education now for instance take computer science you know 
we 've got kids twenty years old right now that could beat any computer professor at microcomputer applications 
i know we do 
and these people can n't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches because there 's no comprehensive test that they can take that would allow them to s- to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college 
you 
you know i went to college late on in life 
and i realize that hey you know it 's nothing but four years of endurance 
and you might be teachable 
you know what i mean 
know yeah 
i mean my agree is absolutely worthless 
it 's my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial 
but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards 
what did you get your degree in 
industrial marketing 
and what 's your job now 
well actually i 'm selling computer software 
but the two are mutually exclusive because the it 's experience that got me the job that i got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college not my degree which is i think kind of bizzaro 
huh 
maybe 
all right 
what else could we change 
oh i 'd like to see flexible hours and teaching you know shared job sharing more of that 
well let 's that 's we 've already we 've already got that 
well see we 've got a little bit of it but not much 
and it 'd be nice if your you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing 
what else 
i 'd like to be able to to evaluate your boss 
and it really carry some weight 
and you get to choose your boss 
um-hum well 
yeah 
supervisor evaluation 's always been a tough one especially in my line because you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check 
huh 
well so you get to evaluate him though 
well not really 
you know i mean i- there 's what what 's to evaluate -ate him on you know 
i mean uh my my supervisory level is like practically zero 
i run the whole show 
and when i need something i tell my boss 
and he gets it for me because he knows that i know what i 'm doing 
why not no yeah 
you know and uh that that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the in the large market place you know the major corporation because so often you know you get a guy who 's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak 
yeah 
you know it 's it 's hard for me to y- you know especially since i 'm in marketing sales you know 
i make more than my boss because he 's salary and i 'm not 
i make as much as i earn 
you know if i do n't make a sale i do n't make anything 
yeah 
well it 's a little tough 
but uh you know there are you know requirements and and quotas and what not for me to make 
but uh bottom line on on that kind of thing is you know we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who are n't doing a damn thing 
they 're just there 
you know the work they do could be totally eliminated 
and not that they are n't working not that they are n't trying or anything it 's just that their jobs are useless you know 
take for instance um a large construction company i used to work for ed swampers 
swampers a guy who 's in the union 
he 's a laborer 
and he 's assigned to 
okay 
in order to make the uh curried chicken i just fried the chicken until it was nice and brown you know 
uh-huh 
make sure it 's nice and brown on both sides 
and then you take it out of the fat 
and you you let the chicken that you fried kind of drain so that a lot of the oil comes out of it 
uh-huh 
and then you you uh pour most of the all of the oil out of the pan 
and you kind of clean it out 
and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some um bell peppers and onions in in that little bit of oil maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons let that brown then put all of the chicken back in there 
and then you uh mix flour and a cup of water maybe uh one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water 
stir it real real well 
uh-huh 
then you uh pour that in there you know to make the gravy 
and you let it come to a boil again 
and then you let it simmer 
and you add uh about a tablespoon of what i 'm using now is jamaican curry powder 
oh 
and that 's going to it 's going to be really good 
that 's very spicy too 
yeah 
it 's 
i mean these bell peppers and curry 
right 
and then if you like it really hot you can add some hot hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff 
oh that sounds really good 
yeah 
huh 
i guess it was 
is this dinner time for you 
uh well it will be in a little while 
i 'm trying to get it get it ready early 
all done in advance 
that 's um 
i uh i 'm i 'm not that great a cook 
but i was single until i was thirty 
so i did cook a little you know 
oh 
uh and i cook a little bit now 
what i like to do mostly is stir fries 
and my wife normally says you know oh tom why why do n't you make a stir fry tonight 
so we even we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok 
oh uh-huh 
and we do a lot of um stir fry vegetables 
what kind of wok do you have 
is it is it a real chinese wok 
it 's it 's called a stir fry pan 
and it and it fits right on your uh si- it fits right on your burner whether it 's gas or electric 
so it 's it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does 
or uh-huh uh-huh 
i see 
and um normally what happ- what we do is um just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular oi- vegetable oil 
but i will use peanut peanut oil or things 
and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and um green peppers and um maybe put in a little bit of um garlic and ginger uh beforehand 
that gives uh uh uh spicier flavor 
and then after the stir fry is over just mix in um a little bit of uh sometimes chicken broth and corn starch and soy sauce 
yeah 
and that sort of makes a uh a glaze that sticks to the the vegetables 
uh-huh 
i 've used 
you turn them over 
a lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu 
we do n't put in meat cause i guess we 're i 'm not 
uh-huh 
but uh she likes to watch all the how much red meat and things 
so we 'll do a lot of times vegetarian 
i yeah 
but it 's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and uh carrots and celery and green peppers and um oh gee mushrooms 
oh that 's that sounds real good except the squash 
it 's it 's a pretty big 
and we put that over rice 
i just do n't like squash 
oh you do n't 
i never did 
my mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash 
and she 'd have squash and corn bread 
oh 
and maybe some she 'd have chicken or something 
uh-huh 
and i 'd just be 
yeah 
see we never in fact i never had squash growing up 
my my wife eats more vegetables ate more vegetable than i did growing up 
i 'm i 'm from pittsburgh 
and pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town 
uh-huh 
yeah 
recipes in pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato 
uh-huh 
red meat and a potato 
oh that sounds good 
we we were from north carolina 
and we had a garden 
and my mother would would uh grow the squash 
and she 'd grow white potatoes and onions and a cabbage and collards and all kinds of 
oh she had all of those types of vegetables 
right 
see never no vegetables in my family 
wow 
yeah 
it was really funny 
you would n't believe it we even raised chickens 
well that was a real farm 
you ever seen anybody kill a chicken 
no 
but i i 've i 've uh 
i 've heard stories 
no and they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off 
uh 
and then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub 
and finally it dies down 
get just a little patter 
and then it 
oh this is terr- 
uh you should n't be talking about this right before you 're while you 're fixing dinner 
getting ready to eat chicken too 
that 's right 
you should be careful 
that 's pretty funny 
but my dad used to tell stories you know about the way they eat chickens 
but i never we never we lived in the suburbs 
we we bought everything in a grocery store 
uh-huh 
there was no 
but it was funny you know 
it 
so but when we got married you know a lot more vegetables a lot more you know a lot of changes 
well that 's good 
a lot of people are eating healthier now a days 
i think so too 
yeah 
but we just went shopping 
and we came back with uh with um sweets you know chocolate covered peanuts 
we came back with sweets 
ugh 
we did n't bring all the healthy food back too 
yeah 
i 'm trying to learn how to cook um deserts without without all of the sweets you know 
maybe use honey or something 
uh-huh 
well that 's that 's supposed to be um the trend of the future but uh the cut back 
yeah 
i uh recently was over a friends house that 's indian 
and uh she had brought indian sweets into the office 
and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots 
oh 
yeah 
that was a sweet 
and i was like ugh 
this is a sweet 
oh it is it 's a candy 
i 'm like ugh you know 
indian candy is not very good 
uh right 
but everything was and everything 
you did n't notice it at first 
but everything was sort of hot 
everything had a little bit of curry in every 
the spice 
yeah 
it was funny 
even the sweets did 
wow 
when you first took a bite of them you did n't notice it 
but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it 
you know it had that that after taste that 
very it was a very indian flavor 
yeah 
good 
they did n't have 
i did n't like her desserts very well 
they were very yogurt and carrots and pin pistachios pistachio nuts and yogurt 
yeah huh uh-huh 
and it was n't very good 
well i might have liked some of that 
i i like hot stuff 
uh-huh 
i really do 
yeah 
well have we done our ten minutes 
oh is it ten minutes 
something like that 
i think we 're 
i do n't know 
do we get a signal 
no 
nor- normally they just come in 
and they say you 've overextended your your conversation 
oh well this is my first one 
oh okay 
well that 's 
you 'll see 
it will normally it will come on 
and it 'll say you 've over extended your conversation 
you now have fifteen minutes to compl- fifteen seconds to complete it 
so oh wow 
but uh i 've been cut off twice 
um-hum 
so i just thought 
in fact just also 
i 'm hearing a siren outside 
i think my my neighbors car must have got bumped you know 
he has one of those alarms on his car 
goodness 
one of the the neighbor has an alarm on a car 
and it 's going off 
uh-huh 
so i was going to go out and see what they were doing 
well okay 
okay 
hey thanks so much 
yeah 
thank you 
it was nice talking with you 
uh-huh 
and you said this was your fi- 
well you 'll you 'll get a couple more probably 
yeah 
i uh if i called yesterday i or friday 
maybe i talked to somebody that uh i got them on uh during the day 
it was a housewife 
and she was home with two kids 
oh 
and while we 're talking the kids are screaming in the background you know that they wanted something 
and they were arguing back and forth 
and she just kept talking the whole time 
it was pretty funny 
yeah 
kind of hard that way 
okay 
okay 
hey thanks a lot 
i 'll talk to you later 
all right 
thank you 
bye-bye 
bye 
okay 
i guess its recording 
um what kind of hobbies do you have 
do you sing or knit or anything 
well i um i do cross-stitch 
and i enjoy reading and playing softball 
okay 
i uh i started knitting awhile ago 
i knitted 
i did n't know even know what the stitch is called 
i just had this uh uh piece of yarn 
and i wanted to start something 
so i remembered something i learned i think when i was five years old 
so i kept doing that 
and now i have a little blanket 
but that 's all i 've done 
oh really 
so 
well i know that i learned how to knit one time and um made a few things 
but i have n't done it in so long that i probably would n't remember how 
um do you make sweaters and things or just blankets 
well if i remember i think we made some like christmas stockings 
you could make the like the granny squares or whatever and sew them together and make christmas stockings and maybe some slippers or something like that 
or uh-huh 
oh 
i see 
nothing as big as a blanket 
hum 
i know that my husband 's grandmother does a lot of that 
uh-huh 
and she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff 
but 
i probably wo n't make anything beyond this blanket 
i do n't know why 
it 's just too time consuming 
yeah 
do you have any other hobbies 
um i like to sing 
i 've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that 
oh well that 's good 
um right now my actual job is a news reporter 
but uh if i could do anything i wanted to do it would be to sing professionally 
but um 
so are you on the tv then 
yes 
uh-huh 
oh 
i i 'm in uh 
i work for channel six in waco 
oh okay 
and so i do little news reports and things 
that it 's not as exciting as it as it sounds 
but um 
so you do n't have too much time for hobbies 
uh no 
not much um 
my day is usually pretty full 
yeah 
my schedule is like from nine to five thirty 
but i could be at work from anytime you know from nine -til nine at night or ten or whatever 
so it 's hard to make plans much less you know have a hobby 
and even if i had a hobby like knitting or something and i wanted to take it to work i 'd probably never get to it 
yeah 
you know so what do you do 
um 
normally 
i 'm a housewife 
oh okay 
so unless the kids are asleep i do n't get usually get much done either 
um-hum 
but i 've made a um few things cross-stitch things 
i really enjoy doing that 
um-hum 
and um i made uh like stockings for both my children and a christmas tree skirt and that type of thing 
oh 
and it just takes a long time to get it done 
but you know once you 've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good to to see it 
right 
i show- i showed mine to my boyfriend 
and he was like you did n't make that 
but really 
oh yeah 
it it looks uh halfway decent 
actually first thing i did 
but 
i guess you can make baby blankets that would n't take as long 
yeah 
how many children do you have 
two 
oh okay 
i hear them in the background there 
yeah 
all right 
that 's a hobby in itself 
not quite 
a job in itself 
it 's a full-time job 
yeah 
right now i was just sitting here watching tv 
i was getting ready to fall asleep 
so um have you sang at any weddings yet 
but uh yeah 
i sang at one last summer 
um it was my first wedding 
i 've done um little commercials and background singing 
and um i sang all through college and things like that 
but i really have n't done anything really professional perse 
um-hum 
but i did one wedding last year 
and uh i just now got some cards together kind of uh business cards that say singer 
um-hum 
and what does it say a song makes beautiful wedding or something 
and i 've been passing them out to different wedding shops 
i mean when someone comes in you know for a wedding for a wedding dress and they they might ask about it 
oh that 's a good place 
yeah 
um-hum 
this one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because i have a demo tape you know if any one wants to listen 
yeah 
and uh she wanted me to bring it in 
she 's going to play it on saturday 
so that would be great if someone came and heard it and they were like i want that voice 
yeah 
but 
well that 's good 
uh i have n't got any calls yet 
but i only just put them out this week 
so hopefully i 'll get some calls in especially now since this it 's spring 
yeah 
and it 's the wedding season i guess 
oh that 's true 
um-hum 
make your hobby into a business that would be pretty good huh 
yeah 
that would be great 
then i could be getting paid for something i love to do 
yeah 
not that i do n't like reporting 
but i 'd love it 
did you have training in singing when you were younger then 
or 
no 
i 've never i 've never had uh formal training 
i 've just been singing every chance i get 
i try you know in school and yeah choirs 
choirs and that kind of stuff 
and um when i was at ut i was in a group called ensemble one ow nine just twelve singers 
and we did uh little conventions and um uh like dinner parties and things like that 
huh 
sing pop music 
well that 's nice 
so that 's what got me really really interested in it 
um-hum 
so i 'm trying to be sen- sensible too at the same time 
yeah 
not just give up your job and jump right into it 
yeah 
exactly 
my parents would have a fit probably 
but uh i think i either have a ca- or 
yeah 
i do have a call 
hold on one second 
uh-huh 
hello 
yes 
yes 
okay 
that 's my mother on the other line 
i need to go 
oh 
but um i think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes 
are we suppose to hear a beep or anything 
i do n't know 
i 've only done this one other time 
and i thought that the man told me five minutes 
oh okay 
my mother said ten minutes 
so i do n't know 
so oh okay 
but uh okay 
well it was nice talking to you 
and and good luck with your hobbies 
it was nice talking to you too 
good luck with your singing 
okay 
bye 
thanks 
bye 
well the thing is is that uh 
since i 'm in school i do n't like basically have a monthly budget because i 'm living off my dad 
but the thing is is that um i have to keep it under control because for example you know it 's like the the beginning of the semester when you g- have to pay for everything everything 's pretty rough 
but he controls that part 
but then whenever you know 
it 's like once the semester start i 'm the one who has to control how much spending there is 
and the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just food 
and uh so 
yeah yeah what about tuition and rent 
who takes care of that 
well the thing is is that i live in a dorm 
uh 
so uh what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts 
yeah 
and the the tuition is also the same thing 
so the thing is is basically that i spend like maybe thirty five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries 
and that 's about it 
but the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because it 's like i can n't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars uh you know three times a week 
no 
can n't do that very often 
so i mean it 's 
for for us you know it 's like i- i can spend i can spend that money 
but it 's not it 's not what i want to spend it on you know 
are a- are you working anywhere while you 're going to school 
no 
okay 
because um they do n't allow me to work since uh i 'm a foreign student 
oh okay 
and so they the government does n't allow me to work 
yeah 
so all the money comes from home 
uh-huh 
so you got to make uh 
so how do you keep track of where you are in in your monthly spending 
well the thing is is that um i ba- i basically know how much i have right 
right 
and so the thing is is that i i can tell like uh 
i get all my money out of the teller 
yeah 
and besides see o- one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call you know international 
where do you call to 
argentina 
argentina 
yeah 
wow 
and so the bas- 
one of the problems is that i spend too much money on phone bills 
yeah 
talk too long 
well that 's 
they w- they want me to call down there every so often 
yeah 
i me- i told my dad li- dad listen if you want to save money i wo n't call so often you know 
he goes we want to keep in touch 
so it does n't matter about the money because we need to hear from you 
yeah 
yeah so you call him collect 
no 
because it 's more expensive that way 
i would suspect so 
uh any any uh 
basically the united states is the cheapest country to call out of 
yeah 
and uh because it 's considered luxury in other countries 
oh okay 
so you just call him direct 
and then 
right 
since it 's his money anyway you know 
yeah 
so that and he gets the and you get the bill and send it to him 
no 
uh i got money to pay that too 
okay 
so it 's basically you know 
it 's like it 's not too much money 
and it 's not too little money 
so i wo n't have to you know rush a letter to him or something 
yeah 
because uh he really wants me to concentrate on my studies 
yeah 
what are you s- what are you studying 
i 'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering 
and what do you think you 'll do with that 
with those degrees 
um-hum 
well i can i can work up uh here up to a year 
and 
and hopefully get a job after that 
i mean you want to get into some kind of manufacturing 
or or what 's the specialty that you 're looking for 
uh computer communications and data transmissions 
oh okay 
so you want to find a uh data transmissions 
you 're looking for uh um long distance type stuff 
right 
yeah 
you know anywhere from uh local area networks metropolitan area networks you know all that 
and and so well you have a family right 
yeah 
yeah yeah i have uh wife and two children 
and uh 
and does does your wife work 
a- no 
she does n't work 
she does uh 
well it 's kind of hard to say now days uh other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself 
oh okay 
and she gets paid for that 
so she brings some money in 
yeah 
she 's trying to start h- her own business where she does that full time uh alterations and sewing and stuff for the public 
okay 
yeah 
and uh do that on a on a full time basis here in town 
and so and you have a monthly budget 
well s- sort of 
we 're probably like most am- american families i guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we 've got at the end of the month 
right 
and we know what bills have to be paid 
and uh we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with with the monthly budget 
so 
so you do n't have any problem in uh overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that 
oh sure 
we 're like everybody else you know 
you we 've got a uh several credit cards that sometimes uh instead of paying them all off at every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around christmas time 
yeah 
yeah 
you know that 's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff 
well then uh see uh that 's that 's one of the points which i do n't see 
like i i do n't give a lot of gifts during christmas 
and i you know i do n't wa- i do n't like to give any at all because the thing is is that you know it 's like if i want something i 'll i 'll ask somebody you know 
yeah 
yeah 
like like m- uh for ch- for christmas you know my roommate goes what do you want 
and i said i want a backpack 
yeah 
you know uh no 
i told him you if you want to give me a present for christmas give me a backpack 
yeah 
but something that you can use 
right 
because i i needed a backpack 
so he gave me a backpack 
and i i knew he needed an alarm clock 
yeah 
so i bought him an alarm clock 
so the thing was that that 
that 's very uh utilitarian 
right 
but right 
you know you make those things there are no no frivolous gifts 
but uh thing is especially i mean when i was down argentina it was to me was ridiculous 
because you know you have to 
once a year you go out 
and you spend all this money on all these people 
and some you do n't care about you know 
it 's like 
yeah that 's true 
why bother 
yeah 
yeah 
and so but the thing is is that um 
well especially being a college student you your 
i do n't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know 
yeah 
that effects the budget especially around uh christmas time 
it 's the end of the semester you 've got finals and you 've got lots of bills i would suspect 
yeah 
what about when you have breaks like uh christmas or between sessions 
yeah well for example we had spring break now 
and i went skiing 
and i spent around like maybe two hundred dollars 
yeah i expect so 
or so uh but you know its like uh 
you 've got to budget that though 
you 've got to save up in able to do that right 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean 
because it 's like you know say you know it 's like we 're saying let 's go eat out before spring break 
i go let 's not go eat out before spring break 
let 's see how much money we have afterwards 
hm hm yeah yeah right 
and if i felt like i spent way too much then uh i wo n't go out you know 
right 
and so like my roommate went home 
i went skiing in uh over the carolina mountains which are n't anything 
right 
but um but it was you know it was i guess it was worth it 
hm sure it is 
any time you can get away and and get away from from the daily grind 
you know it was a nice place 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
especially if you live on campus and you do n't have a car you just go crazy 
yeah 
i know the feeling 
so oh well let 's see how long have we been talking here 
six minutes and a half 
okay 
is that okay 
yeah 
all right 
all right 
well nice talking to you 
oh nice talking to you 
have a good time 
all right 
bye-bye 
bye 
i guess i 'm going to school while i 'm uh working at ti 
so there 's not a whole lot of time that i 've got uh for hobbies seems like lately 
but one of one the things that i do when i 've got some spare time is and i do some woodworking 
and that oh i guess ranges anywhere from uh carpentry work to uh uh some types of furniture and uh oh i do n't know what you would call them knickknacks i guess stuff you hang on the wall and to put a mirror on 
and i made some uh candle sconces that you hang on the 
yeah 
i have quite a few of those that my uncle made 
there 's something about working with wood that that i enjoy that 
i do n't know if it 's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood 
but 
i think it 's more like the mess you make is n't it 
and you do n't have to worry about cleaning it up 
you know yeah 
because it 's it 's out there 
you know i do n't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust 
and the wife gets kind of aggravated at that 
but then i get the opportunity to vacuum 
so i guess i get s- some of both 
uh what are some of your things you like to do 
well when i have time i do like to sew 
um i had been doing a lot of crocheting 
i make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them 
yeah 
my mother was real heavy into crafts 
and i would help her with whatever she happened to be doing 
and then she would go to these uh arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework 
oh yeah 
so a lot of times i 'd help her with that 
i have n't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately 
we 've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going 
yeah 
it 's a good time for gardening 
oh yeah 
it 's been beautiful this last week 
but 
i could do with a little less wind 
but i think the the temperature 's been pretty good so far for working outside 
yeah 
do you find you do most of your your uh crocheting or your knit work around christmas time 
i usually start in the fall 
yeah 
and my husband says i do it you know make afghans so i can keep my lap warm 
well that 's kind of what my wife says 
she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she 's always got something to cover her l- her legs and feet with while she 's working on it 
yeah 
i know seems like she 
i think she made three this year one for uh my father-in-law and and then a couple of brothers and sisters 
so uh sh- those things they take some time to make 
yeah 
i found one that 's real easy 
it- it 's um um um 
shoot i can n't even remember the name of it now 
but you make it in strips 
and it 's real easy to do 
and it 's just that it does n't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that 
but it 's 
oh that 's kind of like quilting 
yeah 
yeah 
i think the mile a minute 
mile a minute 
that 's the name of it 
mile a minute 
well i 'm not sure what she does 
i i 
first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across you know back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of of afghan 
i guess that 's your standard knitting is n't it 
yeah 
yeah 
usually single crochet would is is always starts it off 
yeah 
i know 
if we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other do n't worry about it 
we have a a very small phone company down here 
oh okay 
and my husband says that 's called rinky-dink 
call instead of call waiting or call anything else 
no 
no 
we can n't have that down here 
we get disconnected all the time 
well i guess that that 's one way to end a conversation 
yeah 
well it gets a little aggravating 
i 've got kids all over the united states 
and and you know sometimes they get disconnected when i 'm talking to them 
yeah 
what 
uh have you started your garden yet 
yes 
we planted um potatoes and onions and bell peppers 
um boy 
uh what else did i get in there 
and jalapeno peppers 
oh yeah 
always got to have those 
yeah 
i think i had four uh jalapeno plants last year 
i think one of them died 
but i i got s- you know i put them i chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because i do- there 's no way that i can eat all those 
and nobody else in the family likes them 
but always got to keep those planted 
yeah 
oh my husband does n't like them either 
but i can always give them away 
well that 's kind of the way i am um 
besides they 're fun to grow 
i planted uh zucchini last year 
uh i planted four hills of them 
i think i had three or four s- seeds in each one of them 
and those things just flat took over 
um it was n't -til late i guess in the summer 
maybe it was because it was too dry 
they finally started making zucchini 
and i 'm not sure when a good time to plant those is if if they should be planted early or later 
it seems like all i got was 
supposedly after the soil warms up 
i would think so um 
seems like these all they all went to uh to leaf 
and it was n't until late in the summer they started making fruit 
so i do n't know if i 'm 
mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon you know 
um-hum 
but i do n't i had n't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is 
i- i doubt if zucchini is in there 
it may not be 
it may not be 
probably the same time the the other squash is though 
you think they are later in the year 
yeah 
uh 
about the same time that you plant okra because it 's supposed to be warm 
well that 's true 
mostly okra that 's grown around here is is later okra 
yeah 
well that 's about uh 
we decided this year 
go ahead 
i 'm sorry 
go ahead 
well i was just going to say we it 's a little over six or seven minutes 
so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding well i 'm 
um that 'd be fine 
oh just anytime 
well all right 
i guess we 'll call this one quits 
and thanks for participating 
all right 
well i 've enjoyed talking to you 
all right 
have a good time 
okay 
bye 
bye 
uh robert what do you uh think what substances do you think are the most uh likely causes of air pollution 
um gee 
i do n't i mean 
i i guess it 's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust you know 
they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that 
right 
so i believe them 
but i 'm not a chemist 
do you um do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like ai- acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from industrial um areas factories and so on 
i do n't really know um 
i grew up in los angeles and have felt like i was victimized by air pollution 
i was going to say 
and and you so you understand smog 
i understand it very well 
and in fact i was a private pilot there 
um-hum 
and i can remember very etched etched clearly in my mind uh flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and and really being unbelieving at what looked like a uh 
wow 
it just looked liked peanut butter 
my word 
thick and brown and so on 
and that was a few years ago 
this was quite a few years ago 
this was in the nineteen sixties 
i- i wonder if it 's any better now because they uh california has such strict rules um about emissions and so on 
people say that it is somewhat better 
right 
um i- i do n't know if you h- uh heard about the uh recent legislation in um colorado um against a power company uh that 's actually on indian land i believe 
but um it has uh been ruled against uh regarding air pollution because they think that it 's causing terrible smog over the grand canyon and um i- particularly in the winter months 
hm 
so they 
it was uh a landmark case because it 's unusual to um 
i can n't 
think they they were talking about shutting it down or if it did n't comply and so on 
so did it burn coal 
i do n't know that 
the information is one of those wire services kind of new- pieces of news you know 
and so it 's hard 
i never did see the full story 
so i do n't know 
yeah 
but they said that it that it really caused so much smog over uh the grand canyon in the winter months that they could n't do the uh piloting uh you know the helicopter trips and that sort of thing which would be horrible because the there 's nothing 
hm 
yeah 
i mean that 's such a spectacle 
it 'd be a shame to ruin it 
yeah 
uh what do you think individuals could do or society could do to alleviate this problem 
uh i do n't uh i do n't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals um maybe just take good care of our cars and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing um 
right 
apart from that i i do n't know what we can do as individuals 
what do you think we can do 
um-hum 
you think it 's more we- more in society 
well i guess i kind of agree there 
i um 
on an individual basis there is n't a lot that we can do about a lot of things 
but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can uh force uh government uh that we elect to deal more seriously with it 
yeah 
and i do think that we have a responsibility there 
i must admit i 'm not always real politically active 
but i do think that um congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards 
yeah 
and it 's brought their the 
they uh really listen to 
the the uh lobbyist and uh the m- car manufacturing companies have uh you know have really pushed 
saying 
all those re- those restrictions too hard 
we can n't we can n't quite make that go 
and they do n't 
and then we still live with air pollution 
yeah 
um so i suspect that that 's one thing that that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators 
but um as a society i think we can do more 
and that 's probably how we ought to do it uh individ- being individually responsible a- as uh in order to be group responsible 
yeah 
i guess i 'm i 'm to the point where i 'm cynical enough that i really do n't believe anything will happen unless unless there 's something economically justifiable about it 
right 
and in the case of air pollution it simply might turn out at some point down the road to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems and everything else that we 'll spend the money that 's necessary to uh to get rid of the source of it 
um-hum 
i suspect that the pub- that there 's going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it 
and probably the only way that can happen is for um governments to realize that they have to pay if companies do n't 
yeah 
and uh i do n't know how long that that 'll take 
people also have to realize they can n't have their cake and eat it 
so if you do n't want to burn coal for power how about nucle- nuclear energy 
sure 
well we do n't want that either 
exactly 
yeah 
right 
how about investing in the sun 
well nobody wants to pay twenty five cents a kilowatt hour i do n't think 
right 
uh i probably would n't mind if it really came down it 
yeah well it 's just the same thing with the car um uh the gasoline 
now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we do n't um run into this kind of problems we 've recently had 
wou- yeah oh yeah 
yeah yes 
yes 
and yet the government 's not going to do that because people are too dependent 
and they do n't want to they do n't want to pay for it 
so instead we spend billions of dollars going to war 
yes 
um you know f- wha- 
however i- it might have had other causes 
certainly oil was a big factor 
oh certainly 
yeah 
um and i think that 's probably going to happen with with such things as air pollution when we when we se- get serious about cleaning up our motors in our automobiles then uh then maybe you know we 'll have a little bit of help um uh 
yeah 
do you have any air pollution in your area 
there 's not really a lot here in raleigh 
uh once in a while we 'll get some uh 
i think it kind of washes down from uh the from your area linda 
oh no 
that 's what they that 's what they 
your talking about from from the uh the middle middle states that that have more factories and so on 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's what they say 
but it 's it 's not it 's not very usual 
and certainly we do n't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities 
yeah 
we really do n't have that either 
although i think i can tell a difference in i lived in this area for about twenty five years and i think i can tell a difference in the comfort level um particularly in the summer uh you know when it gets hot and you have the that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air um usually they say caused by exhaust 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
it seems to me that i 'm more uncomfortable 
and you know my eyes sting more and so on and so on 
so i suspect that it 's it 's an ever growing problem 
yeah 
well i suspect that we 've probably covered everything that we need to here 
right 
i think we 've given them about seven minutes according to my watch 
it was nice talking to you 
and i enjoyed the conversation 
so did i 
bye 
all right have you lived in this area long 
no 
i 've only been here a couple of years 
okay 
uh but uh i- i- i 've noticed that uh this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past 
yeah 
it 's it it 's it 's a lot warmer a lot drier too because usually about this time of year there 's you know you see a little bit more rain 
i mean by uh by mid february i mean we start getting a lot of rain 
yeah 
yeah 
well i remember last year or or the year before uh we had ice and snow we had 
but it 
a had a terrible ice storm uh around this time of the year 
um-hum 
and uh this year it 's been so hot and uh sunny 
it it it 's really uh quite uh quite amazing 
yeah 
unseasonable 
i used to my wife and i we used to live in san antonio couple years ago 
hm 
and it was it was i remember the first day of spring 
it was so much ice that came down later on that a- that afternoon evening 
yes 
it was just it was horrible 
i was just talking to my son today 
he 's up in boston 
and it was twenty nine there 
and it was you know in the seventies out here 
and it was really uh 
yeah 
he really wished he could be here rather than there 
yeah 
well um i do n't know 
i- i guess i 'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather 
oh really 
um i l- i like it warmer 
i mean i like it you know i like it warm 
but it does n't really matter 
i mean i 'd i would much rather see it cooler at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly 
but um 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
i have n't you know 
i d- i don- 
i think it 's really been delightful 
i- i come uh i 've spent most of my time in in warm weather areas 
and uh uh the ice and snow just does n't uh hold any allure for me at all 
well i spent three years in germany 
so i 'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway 
i mean i got used to it 
it was really strange 
i mean when i when when when we came to san antonio it was just like uh uh you know it just just swelter 
and then we got used to it 
and then we went up to dallas 
and it was just 
it 's it 's not it 's not that it 's just hot or dry 
it 's just it 's not very comfortable 
it just 
uh-huh 
he- do you you think think san antonio 's more comfortable than dallas 
yeah 
a little bit 
um-hum 
yeah 
you must well uh 
-t it must be quite a bit hotter down there is n't it 
it yeah 
my wife and i the last day we were in florida we my visiting my um my my parents and my brother and sister 
we were we were down there 
and the last day right before we left we had to i had to ride with my sister 
and the air conditioning went out on the car 
oh wow 
and you know you g- you you -ust get used to air conditioning all the time 
oh yes 
and this 
it was just 
the humidity was like eighty plus eighty percent plus 
and it was just killing us 
oh yeah 
it 's terrible 
yeah orlando is the only place i 've ever been where i 've seen the car sweat 
yeah 
i mean yeah that 's really bad 
yeah 
well i mean i 've i- i- i guess i 've i 've been to some places you know where the weather was just so mild you know places like monterey california or you know 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
it 's just you know so mild 
and then b- been to such extremes like san angelo texas where you just where you walk outside and you sweat 
you know you 're sweating 
yeah 
you look down at your arm 
but you see the water leaving your arm 
it 's so hot and you feel it pulling away bizarre 
hm wow hm 
i know i- i- i tend to i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it 's very temperate 
yeah 
uh uh it does n't 
doe- some people say uh they they like to watch the changing of the seasons 
but uh i i 'd rather you know like southern california you know have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time 
yeah 
so it 's kind of a luxury 
i tend to agree 
but i do n't know 
i- i think in in some in some respects it oh it seems more tolerable 
well i guess this the weather is n't as as lively a topic as uh as some of the others we might have gotten 
no 
the other topics 
i got one topic 
they said talk about the middle east sit- 
i guess we 're supposed to say good-bye or something like about what 
my daughter is here prodding me say good-bye 
we messed up the conversation anyway 
well well i mean i 've had some pretty bad i guess some pretty controversial topics 
so it 's just like well that was my fault 
but but then the weather 's like 
man i mean it 's it get 's pretty mundane 
i mean you can only talk about about the situation you know just so long 
okay 
well nice talking to you 
okay 
tony 
bye-bye 
well do you have any uh television programs that you watch regularly 
oh this is kind of tough 
i do n't too often watch you know shows that are on on a regular basis 
uh-huh 
i do n't have a lot of time 
and i do n't really like some of them to tell you the truth 
i mean i do n't think they have any redeeming value 
no 
but uh oh i watch things like uh sixty minutes every week 
uh-huh 
uh ooh it 's kind of tough to think of some of the others although i do watch some of some of those frivolous things 
uh like on thursday nights at nine oclock when i get home from aerobics i will watch uh knots landing 
oh you will 
yeah 
just something like that for you know uh end of the evening type of thing 
relax 
but uh how about you 
well i watch um 
i like news programs like you mentioned 
and sometimes i will watch um like the cable news network evening news program 
um yeah 
i do n't get that so i do n't have that choice 
yeah 
i- i like that 
i i watch that a couple of times a week um 
it comes on like at nine oclock at night 
uh-huh 
and i really do n't have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly 
i- i have seen that um murphy brown that comes on monday nights before 
uh-huh 
and it 's kind of cute 
yeah 
and but i do n't 
yeah there 's a couple of those i 've seen once in a while 
uh-huh 
uh i can n't think of the name of the one that has the uh military uh fellow 
oh the 
i mean he 's playing a military part 
he 's the husband of the girl on designing women 
uh-huh 
right 
i know who you 're talking about 
i have n't i have seen it i think maybe once 
yeah you know 
it wa- it was on one time when i saw it 
and you know it it 's pretty cute 
i like that 
well i um i 
we really do n't watch too many programs regularly 
my children like some of the morning children 's shows when they 're home 
yeah 
they um 
i just have one son who 's in kindergarten 
so in the morning they will like to watch like um eureka 's castle it 's called 
it 's just like a sesame street show 
uh-huh 
but and they watch a couple of shows like that 
but i do n't watch any daytime tv at all 
yeah 
no 
i do n't 
and uh 
i guess uh there 's some uh things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly 
uh-huh 
on saturdays they have uh a variety of things uh 
and a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time 
but uh they have programs on uh house repairs and how to build things 
uh-huh 
oh 
and um they have a calligraphy show 
and i do calligraphy 
so i watch that 
oh that 's nice 
and um they have a lot of cooking shows 
uh-huh 
and oh you know i 'll just sort of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those 
i do n't sit and watch them 
but but i enjoy some of it 
and especially if i 'm uh cooking on a saturday evening or something 
and one of those is on it kind of inspires me 
that sounds like a good idea 
i notice that um since we moved here that we we did get the cable tv 
and when the newspaper comes out on sunday i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed 
uh-huh 
and i record some 
and then uh we have just totally cut down 
and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there 's always plenty of things that we can record and then watch and then record over it something else 
yeah 
and so that 's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved 
yeah 
we do some of that 
in i 'm fact i probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on tv than you know other kinds of things 
uh-huh 
well that 's probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies 
and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies that i have really enjoyed that i 'm seeing for the first time 
yes 
yeah 
like the marx brothers and things like that 
yeah 
those are pretty good 
i- i like those old ones much better than some of the new stuff 
uh-huh 
right 
and so we we have really enjoyed that 
and it 's really nice not to be running out 
some of the video rentals can be expensive 
and 
yeah 
well going to the movie can be unbelievable 
and um-hum 
right 
going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something 
so we 
i have 
and it 's so convenient at home 
and you can do it anytime y- you take the notion 
yeah 
and so i have really enjoyed that 
but but there are 
i do have friends that watch programs 
like they want to see a particular program 
and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it 
they have some programs that they wo n't miss 
uh-huh 
i 'm not that hung up on most things 
i mean if i miss something big deal 
yes 
well and things are repeated so often that you know if if i have seen just a program once chances are it 'll be that exact same show 
yeah 
that 's true 
yeah 
if i ever decide to tune it in again 
yeah 
the only one i 've ever seen 
and it 'll be showing again 
pretty funny 
yep 
but uh tv is something that we try to not um deliberately try not to get hung up on it like you say 
yeah 
we do too 
it too many other things to do and too much going on 
um-hum 
and we do n't want our kids to to grow up thinking that that 's what you do with your spare time 
right 
i agree 
so it 's a little bit something we try doing 
and there 's there 's a lot of good children 's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day 
uh-huh 
and you could say oh that 's a good program for them because it 's educational 
but still you want them to go out and do other things 
even if they 're good programs you do n't want them sitting there watching them 
right 
yeah 
anyway well 
okay 
well we probably exhausted that huh 
yeah 
that was pretty good 
i- i like that 
and um i guess it 's time to go 
okay 
i enjoyed talking to you 
yes 
nice to have spoken with you too 
okay 
bye-bye 
good-bye 
okay 
well my favorite probably all time tv show is star trek 
and i would like that 
i i like the adventure of it and the idea that that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and then i like the 
they have a new one now 
the star trek the next generation which it 's an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and and doing new things and finding out about different people 
right 
and i 've i 've always liked that show probably the very best 
uh-huh 
i think i 've actually seen a number of star treks one way or another over the years uh although i never watched it regularly 
i 'm certainly acquainted with the character the characters 
uh-huh 
and then i 've seen some of the star trek movies 
yeah 
those 
the movies are good too 
and i i guess all the most the shows i like are are kind of along the same line because they 're all adventures 
uh-huh 
when i when i started thinking about this that those are some of my favorite shows mcgyver because it 's it 's only one person there more than uh you know instead of a cast of people 
uh-huh 
but he 's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and and a few tires and all of a sudden he 's got a hang glider 
and 
i do n't think i i 've even heard of that show 
you have n't 
it 's called mcgyver 
uh-huh 
and what is what is he 
he 's like a semi government type agent who goes out then to uh works for the phoenix foundation supposedly 
uh-huh 
and uh h- his big thing is that he can take pieces of little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things 
he took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder 
uh-huh 
so he he does all kinds of strange things like that 
oh great 
boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard and see if he could build a 747 out of it 
yeah 
see what we can come up with 
do you like the uh news shows twenty twenty an- sixty minutes those kind of things 
well uh i used to watch sixty minutes as a matter of fact 
and uh and i used to like the show very much 
uh-huh 
but unfortunately i find getting rid of your tv set you do throw out some some of the baby with the bath water 
some of the little things 
yeah 
and uh i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it 
i mean i could just sit mindlessly in front of a tv set for hours 
uh 
and i just realized i was sort of like an alcoholic 
if i did n't get the booze out of the house i was going to drink 
oh 
so 
i guess i have n't ever had any trouble with that 
i have more or less i have my favorite shows 
and i usually make time in my day or my week you know to watch those 
yeah 
but for the most part i try i have small kids and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time really when they 're up 
yeah 
yeah 
because they 're 
i guess that that that falls in 
and one of my other favorite shows is sesame street because of the kids 
i like that real well 
right 
well when my kids were little i did have a tv set 
and i did watch a lot of sesame street and a lot of electric company as well 
uh-huh i do n't think they have that on anymore 
oh that would be a shame 
i have n't seen the electric company in a long time 
i i remember it when i was younger of you know catching it on pbs 
but uh i do n't think they show 
it must be in 
maybe it 's in 
if it was in repeats 
but they 're not making new ones 
huh 
i have n't seen it in a long time 
but sesame street is still really good 
yeah 
how about mister rogers 
is he still around 
yes 
yeah 
they still show mister rogers 
i do n't think he 's making new ones 
but they repeat all the old ones 
i see 
i see 
so that 's still a real good show too 
i 
that one tends to come on earlier in the day than i want to turn the tv on 
uh-huh 
sesame street comes on from like nine to ten which is a good time 
and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go 
so it 's 
the timing of of it is good besides the am- what 's on 
right 
i figure your children are preschool 
yes 
i have two little ones 
yeah 
so they like that 
yeah 
i seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon 
they come on both 
they come on like from nine to ten and then from uh five to six 
uh-huh 
okay 
they just repeat over again which is also 
okay 
that 's another thing that 's good about it 
when it comes on right in the dinner hour i f- can feel like i can let them sit in front of the tv and watch 
and they 're watching something worthwhile while i can make dinner and do things i need to do without them under foot 
yeah 
yeah 
little with little kids the tv set really is a i mean 
i used it as a pacifier 
yeah 
i 'm not sure it was that great for my children 
but they turned out okay 
so 
uh it did n't hurt them any 
yeah 
some shows are good for 
i think some shows some 
star trek i 
for the imagination of it all 
the idea i i think that 's one of the things i like about star trek 
uh-huh 
and is is the 
even in for kids watching it some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff 
i do n't let my little ones watch it 
but the imagination of look what we can do you know in the future this is perhaps this will be possible that kind of thing 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
well i think we 've covered most of my favorite tv shows 
well i 'm trying to think if i ever even had a favorite one at one time uh 
let 's see how about uh man from uncle 
i do seem to reme- 
is that the one where they uh he always got this this tape recording that self-destructed 
that 's mission impossible 
uh mission 
that 's right 
mission impossible 
yeah 
i used to watch that 
in fact i can still remember a couple of those 
they were 
i thought those were very good 
yeah 
they always have 
i 've i 've seen some of them on repeats 
yeah 
that uh 
they always had a good plot 
huh 
it kind of kept you guessing on on uh what was going to happen next 
right 
right 
you 
how they 're going get out of their latest scrape 
yeah 
i do remember that 
and uh i remember as a kid my parents watching the ed sullivan show 
that was really the big deal in our household was the ed sullivan show 
oh yeah 
every saturday night 
yeah 
i g- i guess it was a saturday night 
and i went to see the movie the doors a couple of days ago 
and they had this scene uh that por- portraying the doors appearance on the ed sullivan show 
huh 
they even had somebody portraying ed sullivan 
and it was very very funny 
i think it was the funniest part of the of that movie 
um 
well i do n't know 
was there any 
i remember the milton berle show even 
i was i was 
ye- 
i 'm not old enough to recall that one 
well i guess i have to admit that i am 
my tv viewing started sort of mid sixties 
so 
i see 
my folks did n't my folks 
i 'm not even sure if we had one when i was really little 
that may be why bu- 
they probably did n't have a tv until i got to be you know grade school or so 
yeah 
and the shows that i like now they would n't let me watch 
i had to catch them all on repeats 
like star trek they thought that was much too violent for small children 
so 
huh 
i i i i ended up watching a lot of these things on you know repeats in the afternoons or something 
yeah 
that 's that 's interesting 
uh i think it 's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from tv 
people were just as violent before tv was invented maybe even more so 
yeah 
but i guess that 's that 's a different topic 
is n't it 
probably so 
well i think that 's about uh that 's about covered it for me 
so i think i 'll say good-bye 
and we 'll talk another time perhaps 
yeah 
well it was nice talking to you 
tell me tell me where you 're calling from 
i 'm calling from garland texas 
garland texas 
uh-huh 
all right 
i 'm in nor- 
where were you from 
i 'm in raleigh north carolina 
oh my goodness 
i did n't know they did it long distance 
yeah 
i think they 're doing it trying to do it or i hope they 're trying to do it all over the country because they need to collect all kinds of different different dialects 
yes 
well it was nice talking to you 
same here 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
i think we 're supposed to discuss our view of the soviet union as a continuing threat to the united states 
okay 
how do you feel about that 
i do n't really 
i more 
i do n't know about the government as much as um 
the people uh i would n't consider to be a threat at all 
and i really do n't feel much like the soviet union itself is a threat anymore 
i 'm i 'm worried about them 
they 're in a very uh tumultuous state right now with the kinds of uh adaptations that they 're attempting to go through so 
i 'm concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden 
they 're very large and they could become very quickly a large financial burden as as one more stepchild we have to carry around 
yeah 
yeah 
i think that 's that 's a real important aspect 
and that uh as the the mo- the most the mo- 
let 's see the more that we d- that we do or that we can do to help them become self sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming a you know a reality 
i know that uh this last winter was very hard on uh several areas in the in the the ukraine particularly the coal mining regions of siberia uh 
the people there have money 
that 's not their problem 
but there 's no food for them to buy 
and its 
you can n't eat money 
and they have a a problem their their whole attitude um 
i i 'm not sure which crop it was 
but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they could n't get anyone to harvest it 
yeah 
and the people in the city were saying well why should i go do that make the government do that that 's not my job 
right 
they 've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they 've been through now 
and um they 've been they 've been under under the oppression that they 've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms 
but they do n't know how to act yet 
they do n't understand that to make that work 
they 've got to take some responsibility for themselves 
it 's not just the government 's responsibility anymore 
you can n't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well 
absolutely 
and and i think that they 're having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back 
people only go forward 
and i think that that is giving them 
i 'm expecting a call 
and unfortunately i think it 's come through 
i 've enjoyed talking to you 
okay 
thank you 
bye 
all right 
bye-bye 
real problem the last few days one of their uh young hopely stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season 
it was catcher 
uh-huh 
and they really do n't have an excess of catchers 
and it 's really kind of kind of late to you know to start be trying to trade for somebody especially with the salary cap that the rangers have 
yeah 
they 're not the highest paying ball team around 
oh no 
no 
they 're not are they 
but i you know i would i would gladly take the salary of most of the guys i 'll tell you 
oh goodness 
i would too 
even the bench warmer i would 
yeah 
that 's right 
i really have n't been an active ranger fan in several years 
i used to go take my son you know 
when he was in high school he enjoyed going to the baseball game 
um-hum 
i 'll have to admit i k- i kind of went more to s- to see the other team a lot of times than i did the did the rangers 
yeah 
but i think they 're doing better 
i do to um 
i have boys you know l- like eight and eleven 
and we go quite often to watch the rangers 
yeah 
um-hum yeah i can imagine 
i used to love to play baseball when i was a kid 
um-hum 
oh yes 
we 're heavy into that too 
i think it 's more fun to play than it is to watch 
oh i do too 
yeah 
and i think uh what caught so many of our attentions last year was that nolan ryan you know 
yes 
oh of course 
of course 
as a matter of fact i read in the sports page this morning 
he just pitched his first uh exhibition game a day or so ago 
uh-huh 
he pitched five five full innings 
that was almost unheard of for a pitcher to you know to start out that strong 
yes 
yeah yeah huh uh-huh 
in cave no big deal you know 
it 's just part of a days work 
yep yeah 
i know 
yeah 
yeah 
he 's something else 
he really is 
he really is and you know 
as far as predictions and stuff i really think the rangers may come out real strong this year 
they could do very well 
they sure could 
they coul- because 
i do n't know 
but last year i just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything 
um-hum 
right 
i really do 
um-hum 
yep they 've got uh i guess all 
well all of their players are signed now 
some of them are not too happy about it 
but there 's no there 's no hold out 
yeah 
yeah 
at least that should help 
so that should help 
it sure should 
yeah 
it should um-hum 
but in a way i really do 
and of course there 's a few more you know i think are good ball teams also 
oh yeah 
sure 
like oakland a 's and the giants 
i really do 
sure 
um-hum 
cincinnati 
yeah 
there sure are 
yes i like to go watch the giants when they come to houston sometimes 
um-hum 
um-hum 
that 's right 
but uh 
i 've never seen the astros play 
oh you have n't 
huh 
oh i have a few times 
um-hum 
um they 're a good ball team 
they tried 
they really are 
um-hum they sure are 
would n't it be something to have a world series between da- the rangers and the astros 
oh would n't it would n't it though 
boy 
i tell you that would draw a crowd would n't it 
would n't it 
it sure would 
oh my goodness 
we might actually get to go to a world series huh 
that 's right 
would n't that be something 
oh yeah 
sure would 
that 's something you dream about 
absolutely 
but there a lot of ranger fans around 
oh oh there sure is 
and that i mean they really are 
um now incaviglia i do n't know how familiar you are with him 
but last year i was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump 
yeah 
but they 're saying this year their predictions is that he 's really going to come out of it and be on top 
um-hum 
yeah 
um-hum 
boy 
he 's a bull is n't he 
is n't he though 
he really is gosh 
he sure is 
he either hits home run or strike out 
um-hum 
that 's right 
there 's not ever a in between for him 
that 's right 
he 's kind of like babe ruth 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
they were saying something about this may be his last year with the rangers though 
apparently they i think his contract is up after the end of this year 
and they 're not sure they 're going to be able to sign him again 
to sign him again 
yeah 
huh 
yeah 
that you know that may or may not happen 
yeah 
oh you you never know 
that 's right 
it 's a long way away 
that 's sure 
if you offer them money i 'm sure they 'll do a little bit of everything 
um-hum that 's right that 's right 
fortunate 
the rangers do n't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do 
no 
no 
no like that joe jo- canseco you know 
yeah 
that 's right 
i mean oh 
is there going to be a ticket increase this year price do you know 
i had n't heard 
i have n't either 
i- i really have n't um 
yeah the uh those cowboys have increased their prices again this year 
oh yeah 
but i did n't know 
if i- i do n't think i 've heard anything on the rangers 
or i do n't remember it if i have 
well i had n't either 
yeah 
we had n't you know 
like i said we 
ha- i do n't even guess they 've even thought about sending schedules out yet 
yeah 
i guess it 's too early 
yeah 
because we usually get one 
we usually order our tickets way in advance 
um-hum 
it 's a good idea 
yeah 
we we try to go so often 
um-hum 
yeah 
if you have young young children you know they they 'd get a kick out of it 
oh they do 
um-hum 
well i 've enjoyed talking to you 
well you too lori 
and hopefully we 'll get talk again 
right 
you take care 
okay 
bye-bye 
-kay 
bye bye 
you said you have four cats 
yes 
i have four cats 
how old are they 
a- well they range from let 's see about a year and a half to nine years old 
oh gosh 
yes 
i have n't had my oldest one quite nine years 
i 've had him probably five years 
oh okay 
get so attached to them 
yeah oh yes 
i love my cats 
i lost one one time uh 
oh 
the first one i got 
he jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment 
oh no 
and he 'd never been outside like you know by himself outside 
uh-huh 
and it started raining 
and i was hysterical 
i was i 
mean you would have thought a child had died 
yeah 
um-hum 
i called everyone i knew 
i had every friend i knew in the apartment searching for this cat 
yes 
i understand 
and they laughed at me 
they thought that was so hysterical 
oh no 
i understand 
we have uh we 've gone through the same thing with ours 
we 've cut you know they 've been ill 
i mean i take off work to take care of my cats you know 
oh yeah 
th- my boss thinks i 'm absolutely crazy 
and then we had a baby 
and its like all right who comes first the cat or the baby 
right the cat was here first 
so i know 
it 's hard 
and and then when we go to sleep at night you know it 's like uh my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us 
oh how funny 
it 's like all right whose corners is this one 
that 's sweet 
i have the two 
the other two cats i have are outdoor cats 
oh uh-huh 
and they did n't used to be actually 
but they got kind of wild and were n't doing very well inside 
so i put them outside once i got a house 
and they 're doing great out there 
they love it 
but the other one the first one i got he does n't want anything to do with outside unless you 're there 
oh uh-huh 
other than that he gets scared to death 
if you shut that door he goes into hiding 
oh no 
i think it 's from the time he jumped off the balcony 
yes 
uh-huh 
that 's it 
and lord knows what happened to him 
but he 's probably been through all kinds of nightmares 
right 
traumatized for life here 
probably 
oh yeah 
we 've 
all four of ours are house cats 
are they 
we started out with two with two outdoor cats 
but our neighbor decided he did n't like cats and shot one of them 
oh no 
oh well he lived through it 
oh i could n't believe it 
we went through like twenty two hundred dollars worth of vet bills 
oh my gosh 
the the cat almost died 
and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat 
oh he loves life now 
uh i imagine 
and he 's like oh thank you so much 
i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened 
i know 
we wondered about that 
but uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too 
oh oh i can imagine 
what did he shoot him with 
uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet gun 
and then he started chasing him with a bull whip 
oh oh my gosh 
people are crazy 
oh yes 
it was absolutely nuts 
uh but uh luckily enough you know we found the cat in time and uh rushed him to the vet 
and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery 
and tod- 
oh lord 
i mean he started off as a stray 
and then we did all this for him 
oh man 
but oh they he 's been a wonderful cat 
i imagine 
they usually are after something like that happens to them 
it just seems to mellow them or something 
oh yes 
but uh we would n't ha- we would n't have them 
i mean i do n't see us without pets without cats 
no 
there 's just uh there 's this they just fill this void 
oh yeah 
i ke- i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i do n't i can n't take care of them as well because they 're outside 
uh-huh 
and it worries me that one day one of them wo n't come back 
yes 
and i feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things 
but i can n't give them up 
oh no 
i just i go hysterical when they do n't come home 
right 
and you worry about oh who 's taking care of them 
oh j- oh yeah 
and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat 
you know uh-huh 
and you go crazy thinking it might be yours 
uh right 
well i did n't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until i brought one home one night 
we w- i had one that had we had we had to put to sleep he got so sick 
uh-huh 
and uh well i fell in love with this uh it 's a chinchilla persian and uh brought him home 
ooh 
and oh my husband just died 
really 
it was like we can n't take it back 
you 've got we 've got to keep it now 
well it 's here now 
we have to keep it 
yeah 
my my first one that i got 
i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment 
and it took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
yes 
so i found this one 
in a actually it was on a sign at taco bell drive-thru that said free kittens 
oh uh-huh 
and i thought well that 's interesting 
i 'll call them 
uh right 
and he was the only one left 
and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she 'd gotten all her kittens 
oh uh-huh 
and he was the last one she carried across you know 
the whole big sad story 
oh 
so of course i had to take him 
i felt so sorry for him after that 
right 
right 
and he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because he 'll nurse on your ears and your fingers 
oh no 
yeah 
he 
i asked the vet why he did that 
and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed 
so 
yeah 
but he is the lovingest cat 
everybody people who do n't even like cats like him 
oh 
he never meows 
he he does n't have any front claws 
i had him declawed 
oh uh-huh 
but he does n't bite anybody 
he 's just he 's just kind of there real friendly and docile 
oh that 's good 
oh we just uh just love them 
they uh you know get to feeling so lovey and dovey 
and they 'll come up and just start kneading in our chest 
and it 's like oh your claws need trimming 
oh yeah 
yeah 
we do we call that doing biscuits 
oh yes 
yes 
it looks like their kneading bread 
oh it just drives us nuts 
oh i just love cats 
i like dogs 
they 're okay 
i had i had a dog when i lived at home 
um yeah 
but they 're a lot more trouble than cats actually 
they really are 
the cats are so independent 
and they have so much more personality than a dog 
oh yeah 
oh yeah they do 
and but oh they 're so much fun to watch them play 
oh they are 
i love it 
it 's so funny to get more than one cat together because it brings out their personalities 
it 's just just hysterical yes 
and they just act so funny 
oh we 've got 
uh well the two that were outside they 're like brothers 
i mean i 've never seen two cats so close 
really 
and uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house 
uh-huh 
and it is hysterical i mean 
and then the other two cats will follow in suit 
it 's like this train 
a train of cats running around 
i under- sounds like a train 
we 've got we have wooden floors 
and so it just sort of echoes through the house 
oh how funny 
i can imagine 
yeah 
i would n't give anything for my cats 
i love them to death 
oh no 
they 're just they 're they 're just uh they 're wonderful uh 
what are your cats names 
we have uh bonzo bear poindexter and felix 
oh how sweet 
and what do you have 
i have xanadu and precious and rascal 
uh oh 
precious and rascal are brother and sister 
and they do n't look a thing a like 
nothing 
precious is a medium hair yellow cat 
huh uh-huh 
yeah 
and rascal is a black and white short hair 
nothing 
they do n't look a thing a like 
not a thing goodness gracious 
and they came from the same litter and everything 
we have uh uh tortoise which is a black and and orange 
oh 
and she 's so ugly 
so ugly she 's cute 
right 
yes 
uh-huh 
i mean you can n't help but love her 
and she 's the she 's the oldest one and but uh very possessive 
really 
i mean it 's like nobody messes with her mama 
oh 
and uh i mean it comes bedtime 
and she 's right there 
is she the oldest one 
yeah 
she 's the oldest 
and she 
well in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also 
yeah really 
and so yeah 
it uh 
would n't have 
i mean oh if something happens to her 
oh i know 
it 's like the end of the world 
um it will be 
i know that 's how i am about xanadu 
yes oh goodness 
you get so attached to them 
oh definitely 
my mother has dogs 
and i 'm like no 
yeah 
yeah this is nothing like cats 
you can walk a dog 
and that 's okay for a weekend 
but cats are good all the time 
uh-huh right 
i 'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person no it would n't have worked 
it would n't have 
no 
that would be a problem 
oh that 's one of the requirements i asked him 
i said now you do like cats right 
we do n't li- 
have you seen those uh 
do you ever read cosmo 
yes 
uh-huh 
there was a cartoon in cosmo about a year or two ago 
and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date 
and there were cats hanging all over him hanging on his clothes you know 
they had ripped him up 
and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom 
he said of course i love cats 
and you know they were just all over him and sitting on his head the whole nine yards 
it was so funny 
oh yeah 
oh the whole time i was pregnant they kept saying are you getting rid of your cats 
are you getting rid of your cats 
you can n't be pregnant and have cats 
i 'm like uh no no no 
watch me 
right 
the child will learn to like cats and deal with them 
definitely 
i 'm sorry 
we are not getting rid of the cats 
oh i would n't either 
there 'd be no way 
the whole family was so disappointed 
oh really 
oh well 
right 
that 's life 
that 's how life goes 
right uh 
but yes 
we just just love them to death 
i know 
i love mine too 
well it 's been nice talking to you 
uh well well it was nice talking to you too 
i enjoyed it 
me too 
bye 
bye 
okay thanks bye 
bye 
okay mary 
yes 
um the uh the latest one i 've seen uh had to do with a uh uh the uh basically a manhunt um 
and it was uh it was called manhunter actually 
uh the uh the guy uh apparently had a a mental dysfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people uh just uh kill them with uh with as much blood and and guts as possible 
oh how awful 
it was true it was truly awful 
it was not one that i picked 
but uh uh it it it did show some some uh some interesting things about the fbi 
because they were the the uh the characters trying trying to get him were fbi people 
and uh uh of the of the few good things that were in it it did show uh a lot about the fbi about the training and and how they go through training and how they try to to develop uh uh a mental picture of who they 're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that 
and it was uh uh it was was pretty telling about the the the fbi and and their procedures 
i wonder how truthful all of that was or whether that was fictional 
yeah 
i- i- i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the fbi uh going i guess 
yeah 
well they keep it rather secretive 
yes 
yeah 
yeah 
uh the most recent movie i saw uh i 'm afraid was uh 
well two two of them actually 
uh the rain man was one 
oh that was a great one 
was n't that fabulous 
and and driving miss daisy 
oh i loved it 
you know i have n't seen that one yet 
and i need to go see it 
oh you need to see that 
yeah 
that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was jewish and one was black 
uh-huh 
and this all took place in the south 
oh my 
and uh normally never the twain shall meet 
um you bet especially in the south 
yes 
right 
and um uh it it it really was a fantastic movie 
the acting was phenomenal 
but as it it as i recall it got some academy awards did n't it 
oh yes 
jessica tandy won best actress 
and uh 
oh yeah 
that 's right 
it it might have one best picture too 
say yes 
it did 
yes 
it did 
yeah 
just as rain man uh with dustin hoffman uh that that was tremendous and tom cruise 
um-hum that was 
yeah 
i- i think it was more a lesson for tom cruise than anything else in terms of uh of how to act from dustin hoffman 
but uh 
yes 
uh oh that was that was uh what the much of the hype was that tom cruise learned so much from dustin hoffman 
yeah 
it must have been great just being with him on on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his for his lines and all that stuff 
yeah 
and a good bit of that was filmed right there in cincinnati which is just forty five miles from from where i am where i actually live in a suburb of dayton 
and oh 
is is the kmart there 
oh well we do have a kmart here 
you better believe it 
is n't there a kmart everywhere 
that was that was so funny 
had to 
or was it kmart 
yes 
uh he had to buy his underwear at kmart 
right 
right 
yeah 
that was hilarious 
the the i guess the the first the first uh scene in that movie that really got my attention uh concerning the the that disease and all that was when he uh dropped the the uh the toothpicks 
yeah oh yes 
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image 
yes 
yes 
unbelievable 
well you know there are people uh referred to as savants also uh who can do most phenomenal things 
yeah 
and everyone feels they are totally retarded 
yeah 
yeah well because that 's the way they they might seem outwardly 
that 's right 
but boy there 's a lots going on in there 
it 's amazing 
yeah 
yeah 
and i the the i think the the best thing about rain man was the uh the way that they put together the the real awfulness of the of the of the disease a- only 
yes 
a- a- and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it you know 
and and and you need to to to work with it uh you know certainly on on a daily basis but then ag- then again work with it toward a good end not not toward you know winning in las vegas for example 
yes 
and the 
right 
well the warmth that developed between them 
and again it i think was a picture of relationships 
yeah 
again the relationship uh between the two uh that uh never would have occurred uh by accident 
yeah right 
right 
i was uh i was so impressed with that movie 
i saw it three times 
did you 
i can i can s- tell you oh oh so much about that movie just because it it it really rang uh rang a lot of my uh my personal background 
i i have a a brother myself that 's that 's older 
and uh he 's not you know 
nothing nothing of course serious is wrong with him 
but uh but we have gone through these these lapses of of a relationship somewhat sometimes 
yes 
and then you know uh for for for no real you know uh uh direct reason i guess uh we we get into uh uh a really good relationship for a while and then you know back and forth 
so i i was really able to to relate to the the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers 
that was neat 
uh-huh 
well that 's tremendous 
that it 's good because it does make you think about your own family 
yeah 
a lot 
and see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother 
um-hum 
no question 
he the he was he 's one of these guys though that does n't really like to go see movies like that 
he likes the bang them up shoot them up things 
um-hum 
and uh it it was like pulling teeth to go get him to to see it 
but uh oh boy he was uh uh he he gave the the the best response that i 've heard him give of this type of movie for rain man 
i mean he he certainly did n't 
he only saw it one time 
and he did n't go back for more 
but uh but he he said he enjoyed it 
and and 
uh well he at least saw it one time 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah and and he really 
i do n't know 
he he he 's kind of a dustin hoffman fan anyway 
but he was but before he saw the movie he said he was like disappointed that dustin hoffman would do this 
i 'm like oh come on 
well just think of what a phenomenal actor dustin hoffman is 
yeah 
be able to do that to research it and be able to mimic a person uh uh with the kinds of problems that he had 
it and to make it believable 
yes 
i mean i was i- i was believing it 
i do n't know about anybody else 
but i was it was great 
well i 'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them 
he did great 
well it 's just uh been delightful talking with you 
yeah 
yeah 
you take care up there 
and uh let 's hear it for the summertime 
absolutely 
i 'm ready for it 
they 're predicting some more snow for our direction 
no 
oh no 
oh well take care 
take care now 
bye bye 
bye bye 
okay 
well go ahead 
i 'll let you start 
uh i was thinking about whether or not we should have people uh be required to do s- public service for a year or two 
uh-huh 
and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family 
or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to 
i mean you can n't make it everybody 
right 
yeah 
but then you need to make it sure that the rich people can n't buy somebody off and and maybe send them in their place or or get out of it some other way too 
um-hum 
or it could be like the draft where you know before they draft you they ta- y- you get a physical anyway 
so when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical 
and if there 's nothing physically wrong with you then you 're drafted 
it does n't matter how rich you are 
that would be good 
and then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members right 
what 'd you say 
give physicals to the rest of the family members 
and they all had to pass 
oh yeah 
uh 
uh i thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money 
uh-huh 
that 's true 
and uh if they did this maybe help them out in their college cost 
and maybe they could pay people for doing this at least something 
so they c- could subsist 
um-hum well that 's true 
the america 's paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries 
so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time 
yeah 
because actually when you when you do uh service overseas you end up learning something usually that 's that 's really useful plumbing or farming or or something like that 
so you 're really learning a skill 
yeah 
and you know all these old people they would get out of this right all the ones that are already retired 
so what cou- we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country 
what 'd you say 
um-hum 
i 'm just teasing 
yeah 
i i think well that 's probably the i- 
i do n't know whether their idea is to be within the country or outside the country 
well i thought it 'd be a good idea if maybe you took the some of the kids and had them go over to other countries and children from their countries came over to ours too 
a trade off 
yeah 
that would be neat 
yeah 
sort of like an exchange program 
yeah 
uh-huh 
and other than that i can n't think of any other ideas 
yeah 
that 'd be sort of neat 
yeah well i like the idea of uh being uh a mandatory thing for welfare 
course that 's what um that 's sort of like what truman had 
or or was it roosevelt 
i can n't remember um 
with the big 
oh with wpa 
yeah 
yeah 
uh-huh getting people or 
the wor- the work program and all the all the make work jobs 
that was sort of public service in a way 
all the highways they started building 
and we 're still using those things too 
what 'd you say 
we 're still using those things 
yeah 
that 's true a lot of them still out there 
like all these wonderful highways in west virginia 
and no one knows why 
they built lodges before too like at caddo lake 
lake what 
caddo lake 
caddo lake 
it 's between texas and louisiana 
it crosses into both of them 
no 
never heard of it 
well it 's real pretty 
it 's like a swamp 
oh 
you know with all the spanish moss on the trees it 's really it 's eerie 
oh okay 
real pretty like a swamp 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah oh okay 
yeah 
i been uh i got uh talked to someone else before that was a uh a texan 
but i guess that 's uh that 's what we 're going to have 
this is uh a ti experiment to see how talk texans talk to other people 
i do n't know 
where are you from 
uh virginia 
virginia 
oh that 's neat 
i talked to somebody from ohio the other night 
oh yeah 
it is neat to get other people especially since you got other ideas about how people uh how people react to things and stuff especially when it comes to um social services 
uh i- i- i 'm glad they have a lot of uh um you know topics on social services becau- like this thing this is a pretty good idea 
i did n't even know they were thinking about it 
i wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really uh thinking that uh it 'd be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service 
um-hum there is somebody 
and i r- uh i can n't remember who it is 
but there 's a really famous of dang i can n't remember his na- yeah that proposed it 
politician is pushing it or uh or mitch snider or mitch snider 
i read something in people about it 
huh 
mitch snider 
i do n't know who mitch snider is 
oh okay 
well see that 's a dc thing 
mitch snider is the the advocate for the homeless that uh 
he he s- s- said it out here in wa- uh washington 
but he started the um uh the movement for creative nonviolence 
yeah 
yeah 
he started that 
and that that was basically a you know donate time and money to uh help the homeless 
but uh 
so what have your other topics been 
excu- uh 
the other topic was like i said uh something about politicians 
i can n't remember exactly what it was 
it was a real general statement 
i had one that i hated 
it was what meal would you cook for uh a special dinner 
gee whiz 
yeah 
i mean how far can you go with that one right 
and another one though that was good was uh what do you think about the social changes for the last ten twenty and thirty years 
and what do you think has caused some of the social problems 
uh-huh 
that would be neat 
i 'd have to basically say my birth 
that have been it 's probably the best one 
and we had to talk about air pollution too 
what do you think 's causing it 
and what should we do about it 
yeah um-hum 
well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other countries i mean other parts of the state you know 
of course pittsburgh would say you know oh find the better cheaper ways of burning coal you know yeah cleaner ways of burning coal 
uh-huh 
right 
and people in the south would say do n't burn coal you know 
it 's because we do n't have much coal 
oh we have a lot of coal 
in virginia 
but uh it 's uh it 's a dirty fuel 
that 's for sure 
yeah 
well how 'd you get into this program how 'd you get into this program 
excuse me 
how did i get into it 
oh i 'm uh electrical engineer uh here in virginia 
for ti 
no 
no 
uh no 
they 
i 'm in telecommunications company 
and they uh sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers want to participate you know 
so does your company have something to do with ti 
uh not really 
i mean no more than any other company you know 
we buy their parts just as much as anybody else 
but uh no no real association with ti other than being in the same industry electronics industry 
hum 
um-hum 
they just uh they just sent out a letter to everybody they doe- do business with saying that you know if you 're interested we 're doing a study 
and and since 
and do you know how mu- how long this is supposed to go on 
i do n't know 
no 
i do n't 
tha- i do n't either 
i mean it says just keep on until 
and they 'll notify you 
at first i was thinking it was just a week because that 's all it shows you know on the schedule 
but then it seems like it might be longer than a week 
um-hum right 
so what do you think we 're going to get 
wha- what do you think 
what 
what do you think we 're going to get for this 
get 
yeah money 
prizes 
oh i do n't know 
do you know anybody that 's ever done this 
get your own yeah get your own t i seven four l s thirty two or something 
i know ti gets prizes 
what was it a little chip oh yeah i did n't hear about that 
probably for ti employees 
and i was led to believe that if you were n't ti that you get money 
i 'm not ti 
yeah oh oh you 're not you do n't work for texas instruments 
huh-uh 
oh okay 
let 's see one of my friends had a roommate that worked for ti 
and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat 
oh 
so she ran off copies of the thing 
oh 
and i just signed up for it 
oh that 's a neat idea 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
well he 's gotten a good mix i i was saying 
because i 've like i said i heard some other people talking they 've talked to different people in different states and stuff 
uh-huh 
that 's good especially since you call that one eight hundred number 
so so probably knock ti 's profits margin way down 
and it should n't be too good right now anyway because they 've been laying off so many people 
yeah 
right 
this is probably some government study program 
yeah 
really 
so we 're footing the bill on our taxes 
okay 
okay 
well i enjoyed talking with you 
okay 
well thanks a bunch 
we 'll talk to you later 
bye 
i got to save my two year old from a pile of grapes she 's diving into 
well i 'm going to try to please clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around 
okay 
we 'll i 'll talk to y- 
okay bye 
bye-bye 
our community does n't really have any organized recycling drive 
where do you live 
i live in san antonio 
san antonio 
um-hum 
well um i live in garland 
and we 're just beginning to 
we we just built a real big recycling center that recycles everything imaginable 
um-hum 
but as far as that um trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing they 're testing that 
um-hum 
so they 're really not full full force into it 
but they 're trying 
so we 're attempting it 
but i wish we could do more 
yeah 
there 's there 's been no emphasis on recycling at all in san antonio 
i used to work for the power company here 
and there was discussion for a while about uh building a garbage burning uh electric generation plant 
um-hum 
but it just was n't cost effective at the time 
oh 
and there 's there 's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city 
but there is n't any um advertising campaign 
there 's just not any push to recycle 
huh 
i recycle my newspapers and uh alumi- my aluminum stuff 
right 
that 's what i do 
but uh they make it as hard as possible 
it 's just not very convenient to do 
right 
where they put the centers and stuff like that 
um-hum 
yeah 
uh well we have those um which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans 
i do n't know if you all have those around 
yes 
and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because they 're in almost every shopping center 
and you can just stop by 
now everything else like the tra- um paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers 
but but for aluminum that 's real nice 
um-hum 
and i started doing that at work 
um i put out a a trash can and you know for people to put their aluminum cans in 
um-hum 
and that 's really helped a lot 
i mean everybody 's pitched in 
and you know it does n't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can 
yeah 
yeah 
so i really really like that 
but people are really concerned 
it 's just that sometimes it 's not the right people which is really really sad because i wish we would do more 
yeah 
at work we started um all the recycling stuff 
they 're really trying 
i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing that we had last year 
yes 
and um that really started a lot of stuff off 
but you know sometimes it dwindles down 
yeah 
where i work now we recycle all the computer paper 
that 's good 
but that 's about the extent of it 
well that 's well 
at least your trying something 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's just yeah 
it would be nice if it could be more 
and i 'm sure that the uh driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so 
oh do you really 
we sell the paper back to the uh to a paper manufacturing company 
well that 's a neat idea 
well it it defrays the cost of buying the paper i think 
i 
not by much but it does defray it some 
uh-huh right 
enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building 
sure well that 's that 's really good 
i mean at least they 're trying 
yeah 
yeah 
i know a lot of companies that waste so much that 
i 'm even trying 
you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building 
and you know the nice cardboard boxes that you m- packing boxes and they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster 
yes 
and i thought i do n't understand this you know 
yeah 
we 're trying to cut cost and everything like that and and recycle and all that stuff 
and and here we are wasting 
and i do n't understand sometimes the way the thinking the logic behind it 
well the last time uh someone moved offices in my building 
and uh the uh properties people came in with all with the good cardboard boxes 
not the cheap ones of course and packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around 
uh-huh 
i- i took several home because i 'm moving pretty soon 
and they 're good boxes 
that 's exactly what i did 
and they were just going to throw them away 
that 's exactly what i did exactly 
yeah 
because i did n't want to waste that 
hum-um 
and it 's hard enough to find good packing boxes 
right 
and and these boxes are 
you can unfold them 
though right 
so you know there they do n't take up much storage space 
that 's exactly right 
well that 's very good 
yeah 
yeah 
i- i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away 
so 
uh right 
right 
and i thought well i was doing them a favor by taking them 
i found about i found about five um about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes that were in the dumpsters 
yeah 
and i was like oh gosh 
so many people need so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes when you know these are perfect 
um-hum 
so 
yeah 
the ones at the grocery store half the time they 've pulled the lid off 
so you can n't use it anyway 
right 
right 
right 
those 
uh and the uh real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away 
uh-huh 
right 
and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes 
that 's exactly what i do 
those are those are perfect boxes to put files in 
uh-huh 
they 're good for storage and stuff like that 
that 's what i do with a lot of my daughter 's things is i 'll store her you know her like her out dated cards or out of out of season clothes in them 
and they 're just perfect 
what what i 've done in the past 
i do n't have any now 
but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids 
uh-huh 
and you can stack them up and and leave them out and put things in them even 
and they look just as good 
that 's a smart idea 
um-hum 
yeah 
i think i have to try that 
that 's really cute 
yeah 
well you know it 's cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever 
and now they they 're the exact same thing 
that 's all they are 
they just made them look fancy 
um-hum 
yep 
save you some money 
and you 're recycling 
yes 
um-hum 
well that 's neat 
well do you all have um 
we have places that um pay for paper to recycle 
i know you do yours at work 
but for newspaper 
but ours are real hard to find 
that 's the one thing that really discourages me 
i saved pa- you know i recycle paper 
but they 
it 's almost like they do n't want the paper because they do n't pay at all 
i mean they 're real hard to find the places that pay 
and that 's really discouraging 
i mean i just go ahead and take it to the the regular place where it 's you know they just accept it 
uh-huh 
but they um i think they should 
you 
know they want people to recycle i think it 's a you know 
like the aluminum you know 
it gets people to uh doing it you know 
you might you do n't have to pay them a lot 
yeah 
i live near a walmart 
and there 's a big uh uh huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front 
in fact i think there 's two of them and that have several openings 
um-hum 
and it 's for recycling 
and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category 
uh uh-huh 
i do n't 
maybe there 's two for aluminum 
and you do n't get paid 
but it 's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there 
well that 's that 's good 
yeah 
that 's good i 
the one thing i do n't like about the newspaper also is um 
like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk 
you have one for paper and one for just your normal trash 
um-hum 
but in uh in the paper one you have to separate 
you have to make sure you do n't throw away any of the slick paper like magazines 
um-hum 
you can n't throw any of that away 
and you can n't throw certain file type things away 
and i just think it 's such a hassle 
it seems like it would be it 'd be easy to take it all 
i do n't know 
of course i do n't know all that about recycling 
so probably it 's a hassle 
um-hum 
but i do get tired of having to separate paper you know 
um-hum 
it gets to be uh 
i guess you have to make it a habit 
i mean you have to get so used to doing it that it 's a habit 
we 're right 
right 
we had uh a write up in our paper uh this last time at work about um 
they come and you empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash 
and every other day they do your recycling trash 
um-hum 
and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had um dumped all the trash in the same bin 
oh 
and when they were questioned about it they said well we 're running late 
or we did n't have time to do those bins or something 
and that 's real discouraging thinking you 're sitting there working to separate it 
and then they 
and someone else is n't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags 
right 
right 
so they 're they 're really trying to start keeping an eye out for those you know 
talking to the people again about you know 
separate them 
because that is discouraging when you when you do that 
it was hard to get used to those two different trash cans 
um-hum 
but luckily that 'll all get straightened out 
and and they 'll they 'll start separating them 
because i do n't mind doing that 
i feel like i 'm doing uh doing something for the community when i 'm doing that 
yeah 
but anyway 
well i 've enjoyed talking to you 
you too 
well thank you 
bye 
bye 
bye 
uh the last movie that i saw 
i i do n't go to that many 
so i 'll just have to talk about the ones that i went to see 
but uh it was awakenings with uh robin williams and uh peter deniro 
okay 
yes 
uh-huh 
have you seen it 
no 
unfortunately i have n't 
i heard it 's really good 
but 
it is 
i just have to take my hat off to peter deniro 
uh-huh 
he is one of the best actors i 've ever seen 
it 's 
there 's a point where 
the uh the show is about these uh catatonic type people that 
this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the the living more or less 
but it wears off 
uh-huh 
and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know uh 
it starts off with like a tic 
um-hum 
and then it gets to where he can n't you know control his movements at all 
and it was just so realistic 
the way you know you have to just keep reminding yourself that he 's an actor 
uh-huh 
what does um 
is 
robby robin williams does he have a funny part in the 
though no 
it was very serious very ser- 
movie or is oh how does he do serious 
he 's good 
he 's he 's talented 
boy he is 
stuff yes y- i 've only seen him in funny stuff 
and so 
i know 
me too 
but uh well what was that show um gar- uh garf- 
i want to say garfield 
but that was n't 
yeah 
uh garp the world of garp 
yeah 
the world according to garp 
he was n't always funny in that show was he 
i did n't read see the the movie 
i read the book 
but i 
i did too 
and that 's why i was thinking it could n't be just a totally funny part 
yeah yeah yeah 
in fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it 
so 
but yeah 
right 
yeah 
well what have you seen 
i think the last movie that we went out to see was dances with wolves 
oh i saw it 
uh well good 
we 've both seen one 
did you cry through much 
yes 
the whole way 
of i was telling a friend i- i said i only cried twice 
but each was about half an hour long 
so 
where did you cry 
um let 's see 
when i each time that i thought that the indians were going to get killed i cried 
um-hum 
um i cried the first time when the um the wagon man got killed when they attacked him 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yeah 
and um i think from there on through the movie 
let 's see what else did it um what other parts 
i can n't remember any of the other parts right yeah 
i cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed 
we- 
i do n't remember when the horse got killed 
oh they 
when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him 
oh yeah 
and then he uh the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards you know 
and that horse has been such a pal to him when he was alone 
yeah 
you can tell i 'm an animal lover 
you can hear my dog 
um-hum yeah uh unfortunately we do n't have any animals 
so um 
yeah 
it was a beautiful story 
it really was 
but it 
there was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie 
um-hum 
um 
what did you think about the buffalo scenes 
oh i thought it was awful and so graphic 
that was 
yeah 
i mean i had n't even imagined it you know 
i think we 've all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo 
um-hum 
um i had a friend who had fixed some uh chili buffalo chili and about a week before went to see the movie 
oh oh 
of course they raise them now you know to eat 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that 's not 
but she we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili uh after seeing that 
um-hum 
yeah well at least you know that it was n't same situation that the buffalo died in 
no 
it was n't 
um i thought the scenes when the buffaloes running though were beautiful 
like that was great 
oh yeah 
and there were so many of them 
i did n't know that that many buffaloes alive much less in one place 
yeah 
really 
so that was pretty 
really and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path 
um-hum yeah 
and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing 
i wonder how they kept up with them though 
it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast 
i know 
i guess they graze though 
that would n't -ve been a problem 
yeah 
yeah 
it uh uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes uh of of that movie 
no 
huh-uh 
it was 
they tried to keep it you know as very close to real 
um-hum 
i mean like kevin costner did all of his own scenes 
and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl 
oh 
uh-huh that 's the part they had trouble finding was wolves 
i guess they 're just not domesticated 
or or 
yeah 
right 
they just do n't howl that much anymore 
huh that 'll teach them with a couple minutes huh 
i could they c- bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off 
and that 's all they 'd have to do 
yeah 
well that 's funny 
well i think we 've made it 
yeah oh is that five minutes 
is that 
i do n't know 
is it five or three 
okay oh 
i 'm not sure 
i 'm not either 
okay 
well i think we 're we 're we 've done okay though 
okay 
me too 
well thank you for calling 
well thank you 
hope you enjoy some more good movies late- 
yeah 
you too 
bye bye 
bye bye 
back by that 
the um uh 
you know there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of woman how women have changed 
um-hum 
uh look at them 
in england margaret thatcher was prime minister uh indira gandhi uh in india 
um-hum 
so many uh women are heads of state 
and i you know we we keep saying oh yes we feel someday a woman will be president 
but i have some question whether or not they will ever really get around to that 
i think we 'll have a black president b- before we have a woman president 
um-hum 
and uh i do n't know that that 's bad or good 
it 's just a point that i have observed that we 
yeah 
i- i- 
yeah 
i- i- i truly believe that that before that that we have to address the racial racial issues in the united states before we can go anywhere 
yes 
right 
um because it is so you know it 
a friend of mine wen- traveled to belize and and into honduras 
uh oh 
hello 
uh oh i think we 're s- we 're supposed to hang up 
yeah 
well it was n't the matter of wealth 
it was the matter that they were not wealthy that made them equal 
yes 
well i 'll talk to you later 
alrighty 
thank you 
okay 
bye-bye 
okay uh 
could you tell me what you think contributes most to uh air pollution 
well it 's hard to say 
i mean while it 's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories uh pollute a lot um if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano uh it 's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all 
what do you think 
um well you talked about uh volcanos 
i 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and and what the amount of material that they do uh put into the atmosphere 
i think probably the greatest cause is uh vehicles especially around cities 
um-hum 
um uh do you live right in the city itself 
uh no 
i 'm more out in the suburbs 
but i certainly work near a city 
uh okay 
so can can you notice 
how about you 
well it 's it 's 
i live in a rural area 
um-hum 
uh it 's mainly farms and uh no heavy industry 
uh attleboro itself 
i live in rhode island 
um-hum oh i see 
and it 's in the north 
i live up in the uh northeast corner 
and attleboro sits in just over the line where ti 's plant is 
um-hum 
but there is n't a lot of heavy industry 
there 's the freeways 
and we get an occasional 
w- it depends which way the wind 's blowing from boston because we 're only like about forty miles south of boston 
so we 'll pick up that 
and uh i 've noticed over the past say maybe five or six years uh 
we live about twenty miles away from the state airport 
and i notice the fly patterns now of the jets are they getting bigger 
they 're swinging wider so that now they 're coming over the over the our homes 
um-hum 
and it seems like uh um we 're catching all their residue 
i 'm not sure if it 's kerosene or what that 's dropping 
but other than that you know we do n't have the unless we 're catching it from the midwest the emissions -eah from the power plants 
um-hum yeah 
um 
do n't you mean like from the coal 
yeah 
yeah 
we generate 
one of ou- ou- biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to uh generate electricity 
hm 
um there does n't seem to be much emission from them 
but i 'm not sure about the rest of the country 
yeah 
i 've noticed locally a major problem is kodak 
um it 's interesting because in order to uh keep with the epa standards which which tend to be visible uh what 's coming out of your smokestack they do all their emissions at night 
uh so people get up 
is that right 
yeah 
people get up in the morning in that neighborhood 
and they 've got this black ash on their cars which you know seems to be 
y- y- y- yeah 
surprise surprise 
yeah 
i mean i really think if the epa had anything on the ball they 'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and uh you know 
yeah 
them there must be uh um some of the some of the uh uh larger plants up a- up around one twenty eight 
um-hum 
um we 've got reports that uh 
during the night too like they blow off their their stacks from uh th- the boilerhouse for powerhouses 
right 
um-hum 
and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and you know spots all over them 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
so you 're right 
they could do something a- about that i guess 
yeah 
that seems a little ridiculous 
how are your uh your lakes 
and uh 
oh they 've been getting cleaner 
they have 
sure 
but um yeah 
i 'm not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain 
yeah 
acid rain 
yeah 
that 's that 's what i was uh 
i mean the stuff i 've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit um overstated that a lot of the die off they 've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all 
um yeah 
i 'm not an expert 
yeah 
no 
did n't they just have an article oh on uh 
they were dumping lime 
hm 
up upstate new york somewhere um over over huge areas 
i have n't read that 
oh yeah 
and and they thought that was more beneficial because you know and it some of it does soak in 
and some of it runs off right away into the into the streams and rivers 
and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback 
um-hum 
i can n't remember where i 
i read that recently somewhere 
and i can n't remember where 
you 
know it 's interest- 
but i thought it was up there 
so that 's interesting because new hampshire and parts of vermont um they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain 
um-hum 
hm 
um do you kind of think it 's something else then 
well that 's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article 
so that 
oh they did n't say they did n't say what though 
they just said they thought it was 
they did n't say what 
they just said they thought acid rain 's contribution may be less than was previously suspected um but it may be other natural things at work 
um 
hm natural disease 
yeah 
so it 's it 's less than clear 
like i said i do n't remember the article that well 
yeah 
yeah 
but um i do n't know 
i mean what do you think we can uh i guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution 
uh we can demand uh more efficient automobiles for one thing 
i still think that 's that 's uh one of our major causes of pollutants 
um-hum 
uh how we go about that it 's uh uh it 's a little bit difficult 
so you think it 's just up to individuals to ask automakers for uh less polluting vehicles 
yeah 
you n- you n- i think you need a a uh vehicle something like uh uh ralph nader uh nader 's raiders or uh where uh or uh uh aarp which has a lot of members uh if you can get those types of groups 
yeah 
um-hum 
do you really think new vehicles though is a big problem 
i mean i remember reading an article that said like it 's the older polluters 
the the twelve and the fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent of the automobile pollution 
yeah 
and the new cars it 's hardly it 's hardly anything 
they 're better 
but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there 
uh whe- when was the last time you saw a truck that did n't belch smoke or uh 
yeah 
but does n't that just mean they 're out of tune 
or uh i 'm not really sure 
you think that that the uh the trucking indus- uh industry is that uh incompetent that they would n't you know 
fuel is is one of their biggest costs 
right 
so you would 
but diesel engines 
yeah 
diesel engines 
i- you know it 's it 
i mean they do generate a lot of soot 
but that at least you know that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly 
yeah 
yeah 
we could also uh push for legislation for uh rapid transit systems 
uh this country seems to be a little behind on that 
yeah 
on the other hand most people do n't use rapid transit because it 's so inconvenient 
hm yeah 
but only because we got used to uh single person single car driving 
um-hum 
a lot of people do n't even like to carpool 
um-hum 
but we could do that 
that 'll help pollution air pollution 
um-hum 
the uh united states and canada are i guess is is uh it going into uh some types of agreements to limit uh what 's being given out by power plants 
um-hum 
i guess canada 's quite concerned that we 're sending a lot of our stuff up there 
yeah 
sure 
so that 's helping 
well what do you think about like a device a meter o- right on a tailpipe 
and you paid a tax based on how much you polluted 
now that 's an idea 
do n't say that too loud though because uh every city and town will have a meter on your tailpipe generate generate revenue 
well it just means that if you do n't pollute right or you pollute very little you do n't have to pay any tax 
or you just buy one of these things 
and it it um 
i mean you could you could probably devise them so that it slowly closed off your tail pipe 
and uh the less you pollute the longer the device lasts 
and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tailpipe 
and you could n't start your car anymore 
that 's a that 's an interesting concept 
is that your idea 
yeah 
but uh you know it 's uh 
i guess the difficulty would be to somebody could obviously just take it right off the tailpipe again 
so you 'd probably have to build it right into the muffler or something 
well i was going to to say right you could put it in 
you c- you could it could be installed like a catalytic converter 
right 
i mean i guess you could take those off too 
but 
you could take catalytic 
but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off 
yeah 
if you can take a muffler off and only replace 
well not unless it was built into every muffler 
right 
and that 's 
but if you were -st talking about something which was more or less universal that uh buses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax um this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters 
that 's a that 's quite a concept 
you should uh pursue that i think or patent it you know 
yeah 
patent it 
that 's a good idea 
if you could come up with a device that 's the thing 
right 
but it should n't be too hard to do something like that 
but that 's a that 's a thought 
no 
um-hum 
you 're right 
and that will solve uh a lot of problems 
i do n't know if you uh if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that 
um-hum 
uh but you know a proposal to uh uh i guess the proper authorities 
um-hum 
well you might uh generate some yeah you might generate some interest in it 
um-hum yeah 
the automobile regulatory agencies or some- 
but that 's a that 's a good idea 
other than that i 'm not sure what what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization 
um-hum 
okay 
so uh do you own a pc 
um no 
not personally 
but 
but you have one at work 
yes 
uh-huh 
yeah 
several 
okay 
and now because um 
see i 'm doing my uh master 's in computer science and computer engineering 
uh-huh 
and um and i do n't i do n't have one 
but i have to use them like during especially during my undergrad 
right 
uh-huh 
you you use um 
like your first couple of years you use personal computers because uh you know the software 
you know like it 's easier for you to go and run a program you know through the disk because um the grader can do it at home 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
then as the you know as you go up higher like in your senior level you 're doing projects which are are so big 
and you have to have so many people sharing the same data that you can n't use personal computers 
um-hum 
so you have to use you know a main frame 
right 
right 
yeah 
i know 
i uh i do have a uh you know a computer at home 
but it 's one that the company has loaned me 
oh okay 
and that that 's been my situation is that uh that way i can get in access our um um computers that i have up here and you know do work from home 
but does it have uh like a disk drive 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
oh okay 
because uh the ones that we use you you know are like unix base systems 
right 
uh-huh 
and so they do n't have a disk drive 
right 
you know so you can n't 
y- y- the only way that you can do it is through a modem 
right 
and you you know you just do it that way 
yeah 
but that 's uh that 's the only way that you can get to through to the system 
you can n't store it anywhere 
right 
yeah 
no 
i um i- i have both because that that 's what i use all the time is unix systems um versus the dos 
but then i teach dos classes uh at night 
oh okay 
uh-huh 
part time 
so 
and then you also have to do all your grading on the pc 
well that that 's the really neat thing 
i teach in the continuing education classes 
so i do n't uh i do n't have to have grade any grades no grade books 
so that 's great 
oh okay 
but uh no 
i find that i use the the personal computer a lot though for my wordperfect and um also for my spread sheets 
okay 
yeah 
um so i think it 's extremely helpful and very useful 
well uh for us it 's uh uh you know it 's like for doing like you know like resumes and presentations 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
we use like for example a macintosh which is a lot easier for graphics than the p- than you know the ibm pc 's or anything compatible with that due due to the fact that well you know 
yeah 
right 
i- i have n't tested the the ps two yet 
um-hum 
but i do n't know if the software is as easily you know like you can manage it a lot easier than than the old one 
right 
the old one you had to go pick a line use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start and where you know 
right 
with the mouse you do it you know like a hundred times faster 
that 's true 
that 's true 
and uh you also get you know 
when you see it on the macintosh with you know the one i have 
that does n't have any color 
you can look at it 
and that 's the way it 's going to print out 
uh-huh 
and especially if you have a laser printer it 's going to print out the same way as it 's on the screen 
oh um-hum 
and so with you know with the ibm what would happen is uh since the software that i had was it was basically you know 
you only see part of the page 
um-hum 
and so the whole page you you never can actually see it 
oh 
you just draw it 
and they have to zoom out and zoom in 
and you know it 's like every time that you have to do something is it 's really a pain 
um-hum what a hassle 
yeah 
yeah 
and also you know it 's like for for presentations 
it 's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a on a pc 
um-hum 
it can be easily represented on a on a pc 
you know like years back when you did n't have that you would have to map out all this all these numbers and get a graph which you were n't sure if it was okay or not you know 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
but with a with a new system i can calculate everything so fast you know like for spread sheets 
um-hum 
right 
right 
you can see what the trend is over the years 
yeah 
and i love all the windows that they have out now too 
yeah 
that that 
they have really simplified things 
i- i had a i had a program due 
and uh one one window i had the program 
and the other one i had the program running so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know 
right 
right 
i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error 
right 
instead of saying where did i make the error 
uh-huh 
you know go back and forth 
and and you know you always you know 
the old ones you had to go out of your program load up um uh well load up the program again in this case 
um-hum 
after you load it up change it hope that 's right get out of that run the program run uh uh as long as it took and then go back and see if that worked or not 
yes 
yes 
yeah 
but with windows you can have the program 
and say it messed up in line fifty four 
yeah 
so you take a look at line fifty four 
you take a look at the output at the same time 
and you can see that where it messed up because you know 
it 's like in the old computers the ones that uh we 're using here a couple of years ago you would always have to have a printout every time that you ran your program 
um-hum 
you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background 
yeah 
right 
right 
yeah 
i know 
i uh i remember my college days and having to do that too 
di- did you learn it in computer science 
oh yeah 
uh-huh 
i sure did 
and when was this 
uh i graduated in eighty six 
oh okay 
yeah 
so it 's been fairly recent 
yeah 
i know because uh 
all i know is that when i came here in eighty seven they still had uh it was the last year to to put all your punch cards in 
the cards 
ah dear 
i did n't have to bother with that at all thank goodness 
yeah 
so yeah 
no 
but it it was just sensational because i walked in 
and they go oh my god they 're still using this 
yes 
it was like this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out 
and you know you can get a hard copy of it 
wow 
wow 
and that 's about it 
uh-huh 
wow 
so but i mean the price of computers has gone down 
they said that um if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since you know it started 
uh-huh 
they said that uh cars would cost two dollars 
and they would run forever 
oh that would be great 
so i mean it 's like you know the the joke with the yugo you know 
it 's like yeah you you know like when your uh car runs out of gas just throw it away 
uh-huh 
and that that that 's the way it would be 
uh-huh wow 
you know it 's like yeah i think i 'll buy a new car today you know 
so yeah 
but i mean the price has really gone down 
i mean ibm which um 
an ibm pc in like in nineteen eighty one it would cost you five thousand dollars 
oh sure 
oh sure 
and now you can get it you know like for one thousand dollars because uh you know because of the parts basically 
right 
yeah 
and the two eighty six too 
so yeah 
you know what yeah 
the the parts and the labor is what they 're charging you 
they 're not charging you you know over pricing it because it 's like if we sell it for less you know it 's like we 're losing money you know 
um-hum 
right 
it 's like we want to sell it to break even at least 
um-hum 
and i think they stopped producing the ibm pc 
um-hum 
and uh and the uh pc junior was a total failure to them 
oh 
yeah 
they had uh they 're trying to get out small computers 
but the only problem was that when they took that one out the small computer was the ibm pc 
and so you could n't you know 
it 's like sure bring out into the market something that 's smaller when no- nobody uses anything that 's smaller than you know this you know 
yeah 
and so 
oh 
but over the past years ibm has been producing uh like 
every two years they bring out a whole new system you know like the p c b x t d a t and the ps one ps two things you know 
um-hum 
and so it 's just that you have to always compete 
and uh macintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools 
yeah 
because of of their you know 
you can work with it a lot easier 
yeah 
that 's true 
so that 's what they 're trying to do 
oh well i 'll leave you back to your work 
well 
okay 
and uh have a good lunch 
thanks 
bye 
all right 
bye bye 
okay 
what do you like to cook 
i like well i like to cook foods i like to eat 
i like to eat italian food best 
uh-huh 
and i find that i that 's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it 's one dish meals type things and they 're kind of convenient 
um-hum 
that 'd be good for a dinner party that you know to cook that because you do n't have to deal with eight different things coming out at once 
right 
is that what you usually cook when you have a party 
um i usually have parties that are smaller groups 
i do n't have i 've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like thanksgiving and such 
uh-huh 
and so um y- uh yeah 
i guess i usually do 
i like to cook um heavy sauces and um noodles and pasta and such 
really 
that sounds good 
ooh fattening 
yeah 
actually 
how about you 
what do you like to to cook 
um we 
it 's funny that um we 're talking about this 
we just had a dinner party 
and we had um 
our senior pastor and his wife came over 
um-hum 
and i catered to their diet is the only thing though 
so it was n't something i really wanted to make 
i really wanted to make red beans and rice and with 
oh yeah 
anduille y- you know sausage 
because i 'm from new orleans originally 
um-hum 
and um i was going to make that red beans and rice with the those cajun sausage and french bread with garlic butter and stuff 
and um a salad 
and then for desert i w- i would i really wanted to make um just brownies 
or french doughnuts would have been good 
but it 's real hard to make them 
they do n't really come out like they do in new orleans up here 
i do n't know why 
oh 
i do n't know if it 's me or the water or the recipe i have 
but 
humidity or something 
um that 's what i wa- 
that 's what i like to make is just real neat stuff like that 
but 
um-hum uh-huh 
kind of like the italians 
it 's really good 
but instead i catered to their diet 
so i made baked chicken in the crock pot 
and um it was good and everything 
it had all the vegetables in it 
but it seemed kind of boring compared 
it kind of kind of down played compared to what you 'd like huh 
right 
do you find yourself um with all the um cholesterol and and high fiber changing the way that you that you entertain 
i find it changing the way that i eat but not the way i entertain 
because i guess i guess i feel like um if they 're on a diet like that i 'm going to you know honor that 
but if it 's just 
another couple came over um couple weeks later 
and i made 
what did i make that night 
i made a roast 
um-hum 
and i made um oh 
i can n't believe this 
my husband broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday 
oh no 
i can n't believe that 
anyway but um aft- 
when ricky and carrie came over we made um a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit 
um-hum 
and normally i do n't eat we do n't eat like that during the week because of the you know the calories and the fat in it 
uh-huh 
but you know when we 're having guests we just kind of feel like just do it 
and i made blueberry cobbler 
and we had extra crust with it 
yeah 
i mean it was so fattening 
oh that sounds good 
but i do n't think we gained any weight from it 
so 
well every once in a while i- i think i feel the same way 
when i 'm entertaining i do n't take that thing into consideration unless it 's really really 
like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it 's too rich simply because they do n't want the extra calories 
so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes 
um-hum right 
i made a apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over 
and she did n't eat it 
oh yeah 
but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know 
i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies 
um-hum yeah yeah 
yeah 
so um i got a good brownie recipe 
oh that 's good 
but uh anyway so i guess that 's about what i do when i entertain 
uh-huh 
so do you have anything else you want to say about it 
um nothing comes to mind right off 
so i guess not 
or okay 
well it was nice talking to you 
okay 
you too 
okay 
bye 
okay uh 
you want to start by telling me what camping is to you 
do you backpack or hike or 
well uh a little bit uh 
noth- nothing overly strenuous 
no 
the majority of my camping experience is uh a tent by the lake type situation or uh maybe a canoe trip or something like that 
no 
i 've never done a canoe trip 
that sounds interesting 
oh it it 's 
we 've had a lot of fun uh 
i i moved to dallas about five years ago 
and we 've made three different trips since i 've been here the group of friends that i run around with of varying degrees uh of difficulty 
the the last one we did and we have n't had a chance to duplicate was uh was a canoe trip in arkansas 
and the river was it was up about three feet 
so it was uh it was pre- it was pretty challenging 
i imagine 
but uh and then we uh 
as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and uh find uh find a clearing in the woods and go for it 
so they 'll actually fit in the canoe 
and then you go for days at a time 
well yeah 
yeah 
it 's the 
that that particular one was a two day trip 
so what uh 
uh there 's uh there 's a outfitter 
and uh they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you get to you spend the night 
and then uh the second day head on down to the to the pool at the end of the river 
god that sounds like fun 
yeah 
it it really is 
well the camping i grew up with was like tents and coleman stove type 
and uh you know that just either out in the woods or 
actually i i grew up water skiing 
i was uh from california 
okay 
and so we would go up to the sacramento uh river sloughs the delta there 
okay 
and you just pick a campground on the river 
if it got you know over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water you know cooled off 
right 
right 
but uh when i got married my husband had always backpacked 
okay 
and so we did that uh 
i guess that we have n't done it since my kids were born so about three years ago 
and that was a new experience to me 
but i enjoyed it 
i like being able to go back up into the mountains or you know where the trail did n't necessarily lead and where you could n't necessarily pitch a tent 
boy i bet 
yeah 
uh-huh 
but uh that that was interesting 
i i have always wanted to do some white water rafting 
and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that 
yeah 
that 's that was uh that 's always been our next step 
our our our little group of friends here we 've we 've been kind of getting married off and what not 
but uh 
do n't let that stop you 
that 's yeah 
that 
well it it it just puts a damper on things for a little while 
i know 
but we 're we 're starting to get everybody back together 
yeah 
we 'd like to do a float trip down uh oh like big bend area or something like that 
yeah 
so you have n't done that before 
no 
no 
we have n't made that trip yet 
my parents uh were sailing uh this last year down off uh costa rica 
and they took about two weeks and went into 
i do n't even know the name of the river there 
but they went white water rafting 
and mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience 
she said it was truly incredible 
i 'll bet 
yeah 
and you know i 
there 's that sense of it you know you 're kind of scared that risk of like gosh what could happen and then the thrill of you know the excitement of doing it 
so 
uh-huh 
yeah 
exactly 
well do you have anything planned for this summer 
um not really just yet 
we 've uh 
well i i do have uh a little bit of property 
i grew up in south dakota 
oh okay 
and i 've got a piece of property in minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet 
there 's uh there 's a little lake up there 
and uh a group of friends that i i went to college with um got together 
and we basically own all the land around this little lake there 
it 's divided up into ten lots 
oh i imagine 
so we 've got a private lake 
and it 's completely undeveloped at this point 
so that 's a possibility 
and the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime 
it it 's it 's about two hours north of minneapolis 
oh that does n't that sounds good 
so uh yeah 
in fact uh uh 
well i got married last summer 
and uh that 's that 's 
we ended up there for a couple days uh on our honeymoon 
we kind of took uh a tour of the united states for about a week and uh up through that area 
that sounds 
but uh my wife 's real excited about it 
so we 're uh we 're going to hope to get up there sometime early en- 
last year it was the end of july 
and it was a little too late for the fish 
but uh hopefully get up there early enough to to get into some of the some of the fish and uh the the good weather and what not 
we 've been wanting to start camping again this year too 
uh my oldest child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half 
uh-huh 
and then i have a little one that just turned two 
and we are in the process of potty training 
i did n't want to go camping with diapers you know 
oh gosh 
yeah 
yeah 
i 
and and you know at a time when they 're afraid of their shadow all they need is you know some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent 
they 'd be awake all night 
that 's right 
so but i think with him almost potty trained and you know she 's not afraid of her shadow anymore that i 'm i 'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we 'll be able to go uh this summer you know even if it 's like over to rio dosa for a couple of days or something to get them used to it and get them started uh with little back packs of their own and you know things like that 
sure 
right 
you bet 
yeah 
we 'll that you know 
and there 's a lot of places with uh like nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too 
that 's just uh-huh 
well that 's true 
you know it 's like okay this this is this is what uh a pheasant looks like you know 
and okay now we 'll go look for one 
ugh i would need that before i could teach them 
and that kind of thing that well yeah 
that 's 
ever- everybody might learn something that way 
but uh but yeah 
that 's 
there is n't there 's an awful lot of things set up you know just any anything you want to do 
like like you say it can be uh a water ski trip or uh fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching you know hunt hunt with a camera type of thing 
or there 's a lot of different opportunities for things like that 
it 's a lot of fun 
it really is 
hello 
all right uh 
i i would like to talk about just briefly what happened over there in saudi arabia in the political context 
i think it 's uh refreshing to see the uh the support that the president got from the american people 
yeah 
it we i i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed uh that uh 
seemed that every other time a president tried to get support for an action like uh uh president carter and his thing with the the hostage crisis he always did it through rhetoric 
right 
right 
and this time president bush did it through action 
and he he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support 
um-hum 
yes 
or uh i mean he left almost no alternative 
that 's right 
and and it was very interesting how he did it 
and uh i mean i 'm i 'm an air force officer 
so it uh it was interesting for me uh you know 
really 
i 'd certainly uh 
i i mean i think it 's great that all the support 
i have uh friends of mine from the air 
f- i 'm i 'm an engineer and work in the rolm laboratory 
right 
but other engi- guys here on base 
this is a b fifty two base where i work 
so we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there 
yeah 
and they 're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it 
that 's great um 
i- if you remember the vote in the congress to authorize war if necessary was actually pretty close 
yes 
it was 
and if if my memory serves me right i believe a majority of democrats may even have opposed it 
it it was 
yeah 
i 'm i do n't know the exact figure 
but i i would imagine that because of the how close the the the vote was i 'm uh i mean almost certainly would have to be 
just based on the sheer numbers of uh the disparity of excuse me democrats and republicans in congress he 'd think that it would have to have been um 
that 's right 
and uh i i 
gosh this uh this whole thing now with all the uh all the political cartoons on the democrats and how they 're uh uh they 're in in a sad way for ninety two now in terms of the presidential election anyway 
yep 
especially the ones that came out and said oh come on guys let 's talk about this little while longer 
but yeah 
yeah 
i mean how many years are we going to wait 
and what what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time 
right 
right 
i think that was 
all those factors played a part in you know uh the 
no doubt 
everyone was discussing whether we should uh wait longer 
but i i i know that there 's a lot of reasons to wait longer 
but i think we were genuinely concerned about how their military capability 
and we uh i think we over estimated it 
but still we were really highly concerned about it 
i think so too 
and that we were worried that they were getting dug in 
and uh 
well they were 
yeah 
and in fact they were so well dug in that uh when we sent our tanks around behind them they could n't get turned around in time 
right 
they could n't yeah they could n't 
yeah 
it 's true 
they 
saddam thought he had the whole thing uh figured out to to which way we were coming and which what what our doctrine was that uh 
well had had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor 
that 's right 
that 's true 
that 's interesting 
i think uh this political situation over there now is uh uh 
it 'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the this opposition will uh uh 
today the turks uh agreed to support the kurds which is something they 've never done before 
and uh and uh this 
hum interesting 
and the israelis uh and not the israelis but the arabs all of a sudden are uh are cheering for baker on his drive for to reconcile relations with the israelis 
so it 's like 
well baker is is really not very much pro israel 
yeah 
i 
and did you know john sununu is uh half arab 
no uh 
i i think i did hear that at one time a long time ago 
yeah 
because i used to live in uh massachusetts 
but uh 
right 
in fact when he was governor of new hampshire i believe 
yeah 
new hampshire 
okay 
i believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for israel a few years back 
oh my gosh 
and uh now he is a conservative 
but he is not a conservative that favors israel 
uh 
and that that concerns me greatly 
well i do n't 
yeah 
i 'd certainly uh support israel in in their their policy that in defending themselves and in uh in their handling of their foreign policy 
i think i think the stand they have or or the way the command respect i i support that 
i think that is a a positive thing for them after um uh thousands of years 
they have to uh they had 
i think they in 
when they be- became a country they more than or more or less decided they were n't going to take it anymore 
and uh 
well they did n't have much choice 
they could either fight or die 
yeah 
exactly exactly 
and uh um so gee 
i lost my train of thought here 
but uh um so okay 
so i can n't say whether that that i 'm pro israel or anti israel 
i mean i 'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region 
and looks uh that the joining of forces for this uh uh desert shield and desert storm thing ended up being a positive thing 
it is a positive thing um 
however uh every time an organization such as the plo says well we 'll see if we can work with israel then uh they get embarrassed some every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them 
right 
and so you you basically have uh mutually exclusive interests 
either israel is going to occupy the area 
or the arabs are going to occupy the area 
and i 'm just not sure that that there 's going to be any easy permanent solution 
yeah 
somebody 's going to 
and i think that 's the problem the p l o has is that when they whenever one group of them decides that they 're going to negotiate or they 're going to do something they 're going to try to make some peace but uh the end result is that they there so many factions of them and uh some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split 
they end up being becoming divisive themselves 
exactly 
uh i 
it 's interesting 
it is 
i i 'm i 'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months 
but uh that 's 
yeah 
i i commend israel for their restraint in not responding to the scud attacks 
yeah 
i know 
that that is almost i mean that 's absolutely unprecedented 
that was an an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the president and the state department 
yep 
exactly 
exactly 
and that i mean that 's never happened before 
no 
and i do n't know if it will ever happen again 
but 
may not 
well it 's been fun i enj- enjoyed talking with you 
yeah 
okay uh 
i guess uh well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time 
you never know 
all right 
bye bye 
bye bye 
what are your m- music interests 
uh just about any kind of music except acid rock 
i- i do n't care for acid rock 
me too 
oh 
but uh i grew up with country and western 
yeah 
i did too 
but uh just about any kind of music 
and then 
i even like classical music 
yeah 
uh i 'm pretty diversified too 
i- i do n't i do n't like acid rock either 
i 've i grew up in a small town 
so uh the only we only had one radio station 
so it was country music 
yeah 
but then uh when i 
yeah 
i grew up with hank snow and lefty frizzell and hank williams and all of those old country and western songs 
oh really 
you 're older than i am 
but uh i 
did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with james galway 
oh we do n't get channel two 
my our cable does n't 
oh 
i wish we got that one 
it 
that was fabulous 
was it 
well we do n't get channel two 
when 
yeah 
when he played danny boy it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing 
oh really 
yeah 
and uh it was tremendous 
now he he is a g- uh 
actually i did 
i played flute for almost ten years 
yeah 
and and uh so i- i- i- i appreciate his too his his mus- 
yeah 
he he he 's from ireland is n't he 
yeah 
uh-huh 
and it was uh mostly all irish tunes 
was 
yeah 
they they had a band with him that uh had a harpist and another flute and then guy that played the bagpipes plus the uh tin whistle and a couple of violins and a drum 
yeah 
um-hum 
and they they played all the irish jigs and so forth 
it was just fabulous 
yeah 
i he he is really good 
yeah 
i 've i 've i come from a musical background 
yeah 
so uh um i 've played fl- flute flute and piano 
so i- i- i have uh a big appreciation for music up to a point 
yeah 
yeah 
i i 'm getting now to the age where i do n't like the new stuff that 's coming an- much of the new stuff that 's coming out 
yeah 
yeah 
husband says i 'm getting old 
yeah 
i love uh i li- i especially like instrumentals 
do you 
yeah 
i love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen 
th- yeah 
th- that 's nice to do th- that is 
i 've got a i 've got a t- i 've got a two year old who 's now getting 
i 'm getting w- well versed in in kiddy music 
yeah 
uh i 'm i never played an instrument in my life 
i 've always wanted to 
yeah 
i 've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something 
yeah 
but uh but i i 'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music hm 
well i was one of the forced ones 
oh i could never do that 
i was never that brave 
but um yeah 
hm but i guess the closest i 've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir 
yeah 
oh yeah 
i 've i 've done i 've done that at church too 
yeah 
have n't done that in a long time 
yeah 
so let 's see 
what 
well what kind of music do you not like 
well like i say the acid rock 
i just do not ca- 
and i do n't care for rap music either 
oh oh go- 
that 's not music 
huh-uh 
n- no 
that is not 
i do n't know what that is 
but that 's not music 
if i can n't understand the words i do n't want to listen to it 
well it 's it 's it 's not it 's not music 
it 's just it 's just uh uh b- talking in a beat 
it is just it 's not exciting at all 
yeah 
it does n't it does n't give you relaxation 
yeah 
you can n't dance to it 
you can n't do anything to it 
yeah right 
but i and i love uh i look at the orchestra music too like the boston pops or or anything 
yeah 
d- 
yeah 
have you ever been to the t- to the dallas symphony 
uh-huh 
have you 
is it 
are they good 
yeah 
yeah 
they 're good 
are they 
i- i have never i 've never been 
and uh we went and saw uh le- le- les miserables oh the music in that was fantastic 
oh really 
i 've i 've heard i 've heard that that is a really 
yeah 
i heard that was hard to get tickets to 
yeah 
it it uh 
i can n't remember how far in advance we reserved tickets 
but it was out you know out at the state fair music hall 
and uh it was well worth the price 
probably cost yeah 
yeah 
that was a real 
was it 
yeah 
i- i bet it was 
yeah 
i bet i really bet it was 
is that the only uh musical 
do you go see m- m- a lot of musicals 
just just ever so often you know a real a real good one like that one 
yeah 
and 
the that that would be that would be nice 
we went and saw uh i think it was uh sugar babies 
that was good 
that had good music in it 
was it 
i how how 
i can n't i do n't know what that 's about 
uh that was the one with uh mickey rooney 
and uh oh what 's that real oh not real old uh well she is old too dancer um 
i can n't think of her name 
i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can n't say it 
helen something 
uh oh oh i think i know who you 're ta- oh i know who you 're talking talking about 
uh real long legs and dark hair 
she 's got black hair 
yeah 
okay 
i know who your talking about 
i can n't think of her name either 
i can n't think of it 
yeah 
that wa- that was that was 
i remember that being uh here a few years ago 
yeah 
but uh 
oh oh the last country music 
my my parents still uh really like country music 
yeah 
and they they like um they like the oak ridge boys and the stadler brothers 
oh yeah 
yeah 
and and uh well my my my my parents 
blackwoods 
yeah 
m- my husband likes uh country music real well 
and he he likes some of the new groups like shenandoah 
yeah 
and uh yeah 
he really likes shenandoah 
alabama 
yeah 
oh yeah 
al- well yeah 
yeah alabama 
i think th- i think they 're a bit t- over exposed 
yeah 
i get kind of ti- get ti- tired of every other song being alabama on the radio 
but i yeah 
either alabama or hank williams junior 
oh i- i- i- i 've never cared for hank williams junior 
i never neither 
and i never have figured out how he won the entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row 
i 
oh we we watch those award shows too 
we li- we enjoyed watching the country and the grammies and stuff 
but i just i just do n't care for him 
yes yeah 
i just never have 
i do n't 
i guess probably my favorite all time country and western son- or singer is uh probably eddy arnold 
i- is it 
hm 
okay 
uh i- i- i think i i- know who that is 
uh-huh 
i think my parents have have uh some of his records 
but i got ab- i 've got about a hundred and or had a uh some uh i sold some of them i had about a hundred and fifty old seventy eight rpm records of country and western songs 
yeah 
um wow 
smiley burnette i do n't know if you 're old enough to remember him 
i 've heard the name 
he was uh played in the old western movies 
he was the sidekick of gene autry i believe or they 
huh 
i think his name when in the movie was froggy 
had 
i 've i 've never seen a gene autry movie 
had a real raspy voice 
hm 
and uh some of those old ones of course bob wills and his texas playboys and ernest tubbs and red foley and 
no 
i never have 
yeah 
yeah 
those go back quite a ways 
yeah 
i took them up here to collectors records records and was able to get a little money for them but uh my m- mother and dad used to own a restaurant 
yeah 
it 's hard to 
f- oh yeah 
and they had a they had a uh nickelodeon of course in the restaurant 
yeah 
and when they would come and change the records the guys would and the guy would give her the old records so uh that 's where i learned about 
well that would 
that 's neat 
that would be gr- great if they were n't too worn out at the time 
yeah 
course there 's not a whole lot of market for seventy eight rpm records 
is there not 
you you 'd well you 'd think there would be 
well the problem is that most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle and uh they just wo n't play on a modern day uh phonograph 
well that 's true 
oh yeah 
well that 's a shame because i- i we go to antique stores a lot 
and you see seventy eights uh a lot at at the store a- a- at or in record stores 
yeah 
you 'd think there 'd be a market for 
yeah 
i i 'm sure you could find old players for them 
but that 'd cost a fortune if you could find them that worked 
yeah 
yeah 
oh 
course they you know just do n't have the quality of records nowadays either because y- y- you get that scratchy sound 
no 
um-hum 
well those things were big and thick were n't they 
yeah 
yeah 
now you could kill somebody with them 
yeah 
they 
warped real easy 
and the one you buy 
go out and buy one now and they 're just so thin and flimsy 
yeah 
and they just they 're not meant to last at all 
no yeah 
no neither are tapes 
i- i- i buy we buy cassette tapes 
yeah 
and machines will eat them 
yeah 
y- d- so you 're best bet any d- anymo- these days is a compact disk 
those things are practically indestructible 
yes but i- i guess you know the old country and western music you 
back then when i was a kid there was n't that much tv 
oh no 
so that 's all you had to listen to was the radio 
radio 
and uh 
yeah that that 's just what just what you had 
b- 
plus 
yeah 
i think it was better back then to 
the t- there 's too much tv now and the radio is you know more exciting really than than television 
yeah 
yeah 
kept 
your imagination was it i- i- kept 
yeah 
i- 
it just did n't vegetate your mind like television does 
i remember mother and dad always turned on the grand ole opry 
oh yeah 
and 
was that on the radio every week 
yeah 
wha- what day what day was that on 
do you ha- y- can you recall 
i- i seems like it was on a friday 
fri- 
friday or s- 
okay 
uh what do you think about the the idea of having volunteer service for everyone 
uh i think that uh really it would n't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service 
uh and you know i mean there have been so many people that have done it 
and i 've talked with several 
and i think they 've gotten a lot out of it 
well well are you doing any kind of volunteer work now 
not right now 
but i have done uh red cross cross work 
and uh i 've taught cpr training 
a- 
what about when when would people do it when they finished high school 
i think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal because a lot of times if they go straight into college i think they 're going in too quick 
but 
i think particular boys the the maturity 
in fact i was n't very mature when i left high school 
and i i think there 's a there 's a real challenge there 
there 's also this this issue of of uh you know whether you 're really ready 
and i think it gives a different perspective 
right 
uh you 
know i- i think if you 've been out of school a year year and a half before you start to college you appreciate college more than someone that just goes right straight into college 
the only complication is is is how do you fund something like this 
well a lot of parents fund their children 
there are uh some groups that have their children you know go away for a year 
even the religious organizations 
yeah 
i think the mormon church has sends out missionaries that 
right 
and the parents fund them for the whole year year and a half that they 're gone 
that 's uh it 's interesting 
it gets them away from home and and gets them do something useful 
although the kids today though it it seems that almost that their concern for money 
i we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in in trying to find a job to study something that 'll give them a job as opposed to it 'd be curious be curious 
if there wa- if there was mandatory do you consider the option of eith- the mandatory military service or volunteer 
do you think that would be reasonable 
i think it would 
i- in israel the even the women are are required to to be in the military for a certain period of time 
uh i was in the military 
and i personally feel if th- if they have dra- the draft that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men 
well but the the issue of of of would 
y- what what would what would you find it what would you have them do 
you know there 're a lot of people around with 
there 's a lot of unemployment right now 
what would you have these people do if they were brought in 
what into the service 
well yeah 
or 
or say say the volunteer 
say that say that it was mandatory 
well i- i- i think that they ought to have something for the the unemployed in a voluntary field like the i 
do- i do n't know if you know remember about the wpa 
yes 
my father was in the ccc camp 
he was in that 
i mean you know uh it 's not the best thing in the world 
but uh it gave them something to do 
well it seems that there 's some things like the um the programs at least just go around and and and clean up streets and and and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things 
r- 
or go into the the more depressed areas and help repair the houses 
yeah 
in fact we we helped with um oh habitat for humanities 
and that was a that was a good experience 
but you take the kids out 
and and there are a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that that either need demolishing or need fixing up 
so it would be a good idea 
um-hum 
um we 've been doing this three or four minutes 
i think that uh 
do you have any other further comments 
no 
not really 
well it was good talking to you betty 
okay 
i 'll talk to you later 
have a good night 
bye 
okay 
where to start 
well i think uh 
i have n't had that much of course 
i just heard 
but i have n't had that much time to think about it either 
i guess the um biggest thing i f- f- find is the financial aspects uh particularly the ability of people to access you know your financial records or for example your credit r- uh rating almost at will 
um-hum 
um-hum 
that 's true 
i did n't think about that 
and uh of course flying uh 
using your social security number of course permits people to do that and almost anything you do now uh a social security number is required 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and uh of course there 's another aspect of this too uh in terms of invasion of privacy 
i just thought about it 
being a professional and of course you probably belong to one or more professional organizations 
and that is that 
some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which i think is a is an invasion of privacy 
um-hum 
i agree 
yes 
i get some of these things in the mail that i wonder where in the world did they get my address or where did they get my name 
um-hum 
and in fact some of these things i get some of these questionnaires 
it 's funny because i 'm i was in the process of filling one out when i decided i would make this phone call 
but um i have n't got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything 
but when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it your salary information i- i just have a real hard time doing that um 
and they ask you what type of household items do you own like stereos and tv 's and vcr 's 
and and you hate to send something off with your name and address 
and what types of things do you own 
and what kind of money do you make 
and you wonder well who 's going to get ahold of this and think um that 's a nice place to go rob 
and not only that it it opens you to phone solicitations and i i 've noticed more and more i would say over the last six months i am getting more at home phone solicitations for a variety of things from 
right 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i got one tonight about six thirty when i sat down to eat dinner 
carpet cleaning 
i 've had them for carpet cleaning 
i 've had them for of course for you know real estate investments know you get uh please send in your uh you know this particular card and you get uh a free trip or something along those lines 
um-hum 
right 
and so that uh that bothers me because i of course i enjoy being at home and i do not enjoy getting called by strangers uh particularly solicit you know soliciting 
um-hum 
so having your 
and i know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls they just you know start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers 
um-hum 
but some of them are sold 
and i know you 
talking about mailing lists the 
i 
there is one particular group to which i belong 
and for some 
the reason they have three different names for me 
hum 
now the address is the same you know my my office address 
um-hum 
but they have one under you know my first name james 
they have one under my first name and initial middle initial 
um-hum 
then they have a a third one under my just my two initials 
um-hum 
and i get mail here at home under each of those names 
um-hum 
oh no 
so i know that they have sold their mailing list 
right 
and uh i think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy 
yeah 
and uh i can n't really think of anything else offhand that uh 
i think i dislike the phone number part the worst 
i mean it 's it 's one thing to get junk mail because you can you can just put it right in the trash 
but it 's the phone calls 
and you know usually when they call you it 's going to be when you s- right when you sit down to dinner because they know they pretty much know that you 're at work all day 
and they call you right when when you 've just gotten home from work 
the last thing you want is a phone call unless it 's you know something halfway enjoyable 
but if it 's a salesperson it 's just something you do n't want to have to mess with 
and and i 've gotten a lot of them lately 
or i 'll 
sometimes i come home from work 
and there 's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine 
and i 'm just assuming it 's probably a salesman that called during the day 
and i was n't home 
and they 'll probably call me up and you know call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on 
but i find that very annoying the uh mail stuff 
um-hum 
yeah you know 
it 's kind of irritating 
but it 's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls 
i think you i think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner 
i know when i sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity you know to talk and see what 's going on and all those things 
um-hum 
even if friends call it irritates me 
um-hum 
yeah 
so i try to 
i actually during that period of time from you know usually from six oclock or six thirty whenever i get home until eight or so i will shut off the phone and uh my daughter gets irate when i when i do that because you know she 's a teenager so she 'll you know 
um-hum 
um-hum 
uh oh 
why are you cutting off the phone i might get an important phone call 
so so tho- i guess those three things are the uh um most irritating to me 
right 
um-hum 
i agree with the phone too in that i 'm single 
but when i come home from work there 's times i need to pay bills 
i need to balance my checking account 
i need to do all kinds of different things like that 
and even though it 's friends calling sometimes you just feel like this is my quiet time 
i need to get things done 
and the phone ringing bothers me 
but that 's that 's where answering machines are nice because if it 's really important they 'll leave a message 
and i can call them back 
that 's right 
but uh at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in 
sometimes it is just i just want to get away from the phone ringing because it it really does annoy me 
and uh if i 've had a lot of phone calls during the day when occasionally we have uh 
like this past week 
we have to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system 
and uh phone rings like crazy 
and you come home 
and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone 
and if it 's some salesman that just makes it even that much worse 
and uh it just 
i get to where i- i turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone 
but now with this thing i 'm participating in i kind of have to answer it because you never know if it 's the switchboard or if it 's uh you know somebody calling that you really do n't want to talk on the phone 
well i have you know we have a you know voice mail system at uh at the office 
um-hum 
now what i have done is i have forwarded my home phone to the answering service at the office so that i do not have to have a um a ring at all if i if i want to do that 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
a ring at all 
oh huh 
that 's an idea 
right 
and uh or i will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to uh to the office 
um-hum 
and so it 's you know it makes it convenient 
but at the office when i you know 
we can uh on our system and i imagine on most systems you can just route it directly to the answering service 
yeah 
ours is that way too 
and when i when i want to be you know not bothered during the day that 's exactly what i do 
um-hum 
and so uh 
well yours is probably the same as ours 
it 's uh tigon 
is n't tigon uh part of gte or vice versa or something like that 
uh 
seems i read 
yeah 
well tigon is part of gte 
okay 
okay 
that 's it 
that gte had purchased tigon 
and 
um-hum 
yeah 
that 's what we have 
except we call it aspen 
aspen 
but yes 
hum 
and uh we 
i could n't remember in tigon had purchased gte 's phone mail services or if gte had purchased tigon 
i knew there was some type of a tie in there 
i remember reading in the paper a few months back 
but 
yeah 
gte purchased tigon 
okay 
and so we have have been using a the aspen service before they purchased tigon so i imagine we will be uh shifting over to that service uh for a while or if in a while 
um-hum 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
as soon as we determine what we 're going to do with contel after we bought contel 
oh no 
yeah 
oh dana i think we have probably conversed long enough 
i think we did 
well 
that 's good 
all right 
i did n't think we could go too far on this privacy thing 
but uh i guess it 's close enough 
all right 
well thank you for calling 
i ha- i- i enjoyed talking to you 
sure good talking to you jim 
all right 
bye-bye 
take care 
you want to start 
well i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged 
and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that 
yeah 
um i am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women in both in society and in the work place 
uh there 's no doubt about the fact that when i f- was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman 's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily 
uh now i think the change that i 've seen as much as anything is one where couples uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to sh- both share homemaking duties and also how women will uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place 
and i guess that 's a significant change that of i 've both participated in an- and noticed 
i agree um 
the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh the vietnam war 
and you see women going off to wars as well as men 
uh-huh 
um i have wondered why they allowed or let you know both the father and mother go uh 
and the children are left without either parent 
now to me that 's kind of a drawback 
but uh i guess it 's a price you pay 
and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the uh uh day care centers 
wonder about them in what way 
well uh from what i understand there 's been studies that uh these children are uh more rebellious 
uh they term it as more uh creative but uh that they uh are much more contentious 
uh-huh 
so i i do n't i i guess we 'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up you know in in a kind of a uh community rather than a home 
uh-huh 
i have not to be honest had much experience with children in that situation 
yeah 
i i guess one knows one 's own story 
and i know uh in my children 's case it was one where uh pretty much up until the older of two was in uh let 's see i guess basically starting junior high 
and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force 
uh-huh 
um 
so they 
so i guess my experience is is just with what we did 
and and so they did n't really go through the child care route 
yeah 
they were able to be home together 
um and we never actually experienced that 
what in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and and potential changes over the the next generation or so i guess i anticipate um an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles um i do n't know whether there will be an increased amount of of surrogacy that we see 
um-hum uh-huh 
i just do n't know 
what do you mean 
um deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother 
uh oh yeah 
sort of rent a mom to be you know not to be crass about it but uh uh whether one might conceive no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate uh um a professional mother a person for instance that 
yeah 
that 's strange 
a nanny sort of 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and i could you know i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh uh story or whatever 
yeah 
i i do n't think i have a philosophical problem with that 
in fact i think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession 
that 's right 
that 's right 
uh um i i do n't have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on the var- on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not 
uh i know that that my sense is that i have very much an interest and had one in being a parent 
i i do n't know that i uh felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs 
uh-huh 
uh i do n't have boys 
that does n't did n't bother me 
never has 
vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or or as a professional nanny nanny as you put it uh 
yeah 
maybe we 'll see a growth in that where someone makes uh a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
it would be a sort of day care 
but it would be more of a family setting 
right 
um i know that there are young people characterized i guess as being half my age so that by definition that means they 're young uh that in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child 
um-hum 
um-hum 
to come in and live with them 
i could easily envision that 
pardon 
to come in and live with them 
or to put their child into a s- into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids 
uh-huh 
and and you were paying for really high quality care 
yeah 
right 
uh i have acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone because that 's what the experience they want 
and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that that 's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years 
uh-huh 
and then you might have more control over uh the the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i know the day care centers are not cheap either 
you know they 're 
i have n't ever really looked at them 
are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost 
uh well no 
i just know i know several single mothers who absolutely can n't afford it 
they have to go with the a single uh wh- i mean a babysitter more more or less 
uh-huh 
but i think it 's like about sixty dollars a week for two children if i 'm not mistaken 
uh-huh 
and you have to pay that whether you 're on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home sick 
uh-huh 
i mean that is you know just a a rate that you have to pay 
and uh 
what what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in american society 
uh i think i really do n't have a vision 
that 's okay too 
yeah 
i um i think that they will be more in the work place because uh the door 's open 
uh-huh 
and uh it 's just human nature to walk through an open door 
so and i would be glad to see that 
i hope i do n't see a lot more single moms 
but i- it seems in my experience i 'm running across single women all the time 
i 'm i 'm noticing that too 
and and i notice the the a terming emerging called solo parents that i am very aware of the number of solo mothers that that i encounter in the work place 
yeah 
and that that is a little troublesome uh because the pressures on them are are rather rather formidable 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's awful 
yeah 
uh and maybe that 's a change we 'll see 
maybe uh p- the possibility of of women uh who deliberately say no 
we 'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever 
uh-huh 
right 
so 
well i think we 've done it 
well i think we 're about done 
okay 
thank you very much 
uh good bye 
it 's been interesting 
you take care 
okay 
bye 
bye 
so huh what do you think 
should they uh should young americans be forced to do a year of service 
i do n't i do n't think they should be forced 
but i think they should be en- i guess encouraged to to do some kind of public work i guess just to get them i guess involved with community maybe you know 
just community activity 
if nothing else see how the city works stuff like that 
yeah 
i think something like the peace corps is a bit harsh 
yeah 
know kids 
i i think so too 
i think that 's a bit dramatic 
but but other than that i think it it 's a good idea to get them involved in the city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and uh that kind of thing helping out uh volunteering i guess if they can 
move 
on yeah 
i think it 's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two 
yeah 
a- and and force them 
i think that uh i think it 'd be i think mo- i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work 
and no one just realizes it 
you 're right 
i do too 
i think they start out young like in uh girl scouts and boy scouts doing s- 
right 
exactly 
i was a i was a boy scout 
and as part of being a boy scout you had to do you know projects all throughout 
and then to become an eagle scout you have to spend a do a year long project 
ex- 
right 
that 's see that 's what we did in girl scouts 
and and that got you involved real good 
and it i think it starts kids out on the right track 
and it lets them decide if that 's what they enjoy doing 
for yeah 
something 
i think i i now i think people generally volunteer 
yeah 
that that there 's no problem with getting them to to do stuff 
i do too 
i think i think a lot of peop- a lot more people volunteer than than uh than we than get credit for it as you know like in hospitals and uh and the shelters and stuff like that 
and even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays i mean at least they 're getting out and doing it and you know per- helping a- helping out 
i think that 's good 
and 
well we have a funny commercial around here 
it says something like if people were to give five hours a week or five percent of their salary we could they could solve all the world 's problems or something 
so i guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could uh 
yeah 
yeah 
or just or just gave or or j- or just forced our kids just to force kids to serve for uh parents i guess 
i 'll be yeah 
there you go 
substitute 
my my yeah my kid 'll do uh four or five hours this week for me 
tha- 
no problem 
hey yeah 
it sounds pretty good 
that sounds good 
i 've noticed a lot of uh different organizations in our community uh pick up like on the highway and stuff 
and i think that 's pretty neat 
they uh go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over and they clean it up 
oh 
i i 've seen that 
yeah 
and keep it clean 
i think that 's a pretty good idea 
and i think you know again 
i 've seen a lot of young kids doing that 
and i think it gets them prepared to to learn how to volunteer as they get older 
i know i did you know in li- girl scouts and everything 
and after that in high school i would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that 
they they just started trying to get them together l- l- like like that around here from for from the community because uh we had a big ice storm uh ver- very recently 
so 
oh 
you do n't sound like you 're in the north 
you sound like you 're in the south somewhere 
y- 
i 'm in texas 
where are you at 
yeah uh 
i 'm in uh new york 
new york 
u- u- upstate new york 
yeah 
oh gosh 
and uh 
yeah 
long way uh 
yeah 
and we just had a really big ice storm 
and basically half the trees in in in our city i 'm in rochester which is uh right upstate half of the trees in the city um are no good anymore 
um-hum 
oh no 
and that 's how bad it was 
everything is just down everywhere 
oh 
you know we had three hundred thousand people without power 
golly 
you know it was 
and you know and and they and we did n't have power for a week 
and there are still people who do n't have power 
are you seri- 
it 's i- oh yeah 
it 's been over it 's been ten days already 
and there are still something like ten thousand people without power 
oh oh my god 
how do they live 
and were officially yeah and we 're officially in a state of emergency 
funny thing is the news the national news how they covered it um 
yeah 
i have n't heard a thing 
yeah 
i think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something 
and and we 've been in a state of emergency for over you know for ten or eleven days 
oh lord 
you know 
we just got our phone back today uh 
god 
and and they 're you know putting out ads and now for people to come volunteer or to have their organizations come volunteer to help clean up the streets 
well that 's good 
that 's great 
because we have you know 
every- everywhere that a tree is down people need help 
and we 're all all a lot of older folks need help getting their yards cleaned out because they can n't afford to pay anyone 
right 
yeah 
and they and and they certainly can n't carry it themselves 
yeah right 
and 
right 
so 
that 's one thing we do at our church is um we have a group called hearts and hammers 
and we go along 
and i 'm really not sure how we find the individuals 
but we find older people that can not afford to fix up their homes that n- desperately need it 
and uh we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can 
oh that 's great 
yeah 
and spend a day doing 
that 's really neat 
i mean it 's not a lot because you 're just doing a house at a time 
but you know every little bit helps 
and is that supported by all donation to the church and so forth 
or 
uh yeah 
they uh luckily we have a a man who owns a building company 
oh so he 
so he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material 
then what he does n't donate we just go out and buy 
that 's real nice 
yeah 
and it 's not you know we do n't promote it a lot outside the community because we do n't want recognition for it you know so much as we just want to help people out 
right 
so it 's real neat 
that that that 's real good 
it 's yeah it 's like i say it 's not a lot 
and i and i bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that 
but it helps people 
like this last couple we helped you know they were in their eighties 
and she was bedridden 
and i just you know it just tears your heart out to to see this kind of thing 
yeah 
and you know if you can do a- any little bit it helps 
so 
that 's that 's uh that 's real good 
yeah 
we had uh we had organizations like that in college you know 
we had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups 
and some did like that some did elderly visits 
yeah 
some did um some did you know big brother big sister stuff like that 
and i 'm convinced that that that at least twenty five percent of our school participated in some sort of uh some sort of group you know ac- activity like that 
go- 
that 's great 
that 's a lot 
you know twenty fi- i do n't know twenty five percent 
yeah 
my wife was big in that 
that 's that 's a lot of kids though 
and she thinks yeah twenty five percent 
it 's it was a small school 
oh well still that 's a l- you know that 's a good chunk of kid- 
but um 
yeah 
but i mean a a a lot of people would get involved 
and you know because there were all different organizations to do 
there was big brother big sister 
yeah 
they had a yearly auction 
they had a dance marathon for charity or to to to support that group 
yeah 
that 's neat 
such that you know lots of people got involved that way 
that 's great 
yeah 
that 's great 
but uh like i 'll agree with you though 
i do n't think they should have to do a year 
yeah 
no 
neither do i 
i think it should be completely optional 
and you know 
yeah 
i do n't think that some people i do n't think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean 
they 're not worth it 
yeah 
they 're not worth a year 
or some people unfort- just just can n't even afford it you know or whatever 
i mean the peace corps does n't pay very well you know 
right 
oh yeah 
that 's true 
that 's true 
people get shipped off 
and then you know and then and then their parents 
i have a um a a friend whose whose son is in the peace corps in guatemala or daughter is in the peace corps in guatemala right now 
oh 
and you know he and his wife just went off to visit her 
and you know i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in guatemala 
oh oh i i could n't either 
you know so 
i could n't either 
so i think you know 
and and and the kid 's certainly not making much money 
right 
right 
so i can see where that that may be a problem 
yeah 
i just know one person that 's in the peace corps 
and i me- she 's a teacher and and just wanted to do it 
she 'd been a teacher for a while 
just decided she wanted to do it 
so i mean i 'm grateful for people like that 
but i do n't see how they can just yeah just pick up and head on out 
just take off a year 
right yeah 
i do n't 
i wish i could do something like that 
but i can n't 
so 
yeah 
well neither can i 
so i i i i i i did my service before 
and i 'll do my little community service throughout but never never for a year again 
right 
that 's the way i am 
i know the feeling 
but so right so i guess our vote is no 
that 's right 
we 're against it 
that 's right 
well it 's been nice talking to you i 
you too 
and i hope everything works out up there 
guess well yeah 
we 're we 're slowly getting everything back together again 
you know it it 's taking time 
but everything you know 
yeah 
we got lucky 
we had no damage to our house or anything 
so the rest 'll just have to come with time 
good 
good 
that 's great 
yeah 
well good luck 
well good luck to you too 
thanks 
bye-bye 
bye 
okay 
okay 
what do you think about the idea of uh kids having to do public service work for a year 
do you think it 's a 
well i i think it 's a pretty good deal 
i think they should either do that o- or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people 
yes 
yes 
def- 
i i i 'd you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help 
and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home 
and i 'm not sure that that 's not a bad idear 
that 's true 
and or the military for a year or two would n't be bad for 
yeah 
i think it teaches kids how to grow 
how about yourself 
uh i agree with you 
um um what i 'm thinking about is back oh when i was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of 
you know the parents kind of pushed them to join like the boy scouts or the girl scouts 
and they di- do do do a lot of public service activities 
but these days they 're not um 
p- parents are n't encouraging their kids to do things like that 
because when i was in the girl scouts we did a lot of public service things because that 's just part o- of of the scouting and you know 
yeah 
i 've i 
that 's really great 
i i really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts is a excellent two excellent organizations 
they are 
but parents 
but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that 
yeah 
they do 
an- and they do n't follow it at all you know 
there 're very few scouts go on and become eagle scouts 
oh no 
and and i do n't know what the high rank is for the gals 
but 
i- i a 
senior 
ah 
senior 
okay 
so there 's not uh 
oh they 're just not 
um once they get into junior high they just not done anymore 
yeah 
they they lose interest 
and then when they young young adults there 's even less interest they 're 
um-hum 
they 're more for i gue- 
me 
uh not not 
yeah 
grab 
grab 
grab 
walk 
i mean me yeah 
you 're absolutely right 
yeah 
i think it 's a really a good thing 
i i like to see 
of course there 's you know third world countries that can use all kind of help 
yeah 
but there 's a lot that can be done right here in this country too 
but i think we ought to start right here at home 
i 'm you know 
yeah 
um i 'm not i 'm not so sure that overseas help helping overseas would be such a hot idea for s- for uh a lot of young ki- people 
no 
i- it 
but uh since there is much that needs to be done here 
i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what we 've done here 
and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives a much broader outlook 
um-hum 
well it 's been really good 
we talked about this for a few minutes 
and uh hopefully we 'll have another good topic maybe another call someday 
but i i do n't really have too much more to say on this topic i gue- 
no 
uh i agree with you 
we i guess we both agree that it 's a good thing that they should do sometime 
yeah 
okay 
well you take care 
and and enjoy the day 
you too 
you too 
thank you maam 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
normally i listen to cnn or headline news about an hour a day 
and then i supplement that with uh radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week and a newspaper if i have time 
do you 
yeah 
i do n't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday 
so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and and try to catch one of the morning talk shows 
and then i usually end up flipping through cnn and headline news during the evening 
i always try to read the sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the the week 's hot events 
so i try to i try to catch that if nothing else 
that 's true 
and and how do you rate the uh 
h- are you pleased with the news coverage that you 're receiving 
for for local news i think we do real well where it 's 
we live in a kind of small town 
but i think we get excellent local coverage um 
and i like the national news that we see 
we we watch nbc 
and i think they do a real good job 
so i 'm i 've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get 
how about you 
on the whole i 'm pleased when i have an opportunity to hear just the facts 
i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves um since i do n't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite 
right 
uh i think i 'm fed up with trite 
there seems to be more and more of it 
and i understand the void that uh comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations 
and a- as expensive as they are to produce they certainly do n't want any dead airspace 
uh-huh 
yeah 
but i think there 's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us 
and like you said save the commentaries because i 'm going to listen to the the news and draw my own opinions 
i do n't really need their help to do that 
i i we 're certainly in agreement there 
i do n't think radio is as bad to do that as tv is 
uh radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done 
they 're maybe they 're a little more efficient or have more to do over that same time frame 
um-hum 
right 
i do n't know which that answer is 
uh i think the my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like sixty minutes 
do you watch that 
i used to 
but i do n't anymore maybe once or twice a year 
well i used to watch sixty minutes until they did two programs uh that i knew both the people and the inc- incidences 
uh-huh 
and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint that was in my estimate nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings 
really 
yes 
and it ever since that time i just do n't watch uh 
so i guess we have the the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not 
yeah 
well i had heard a couple of people you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what sixty minutes presented and that they did n't present it nearly the same way as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with 
so i started questioning just how how bias they really were 
so 
i do n't know di- i do n't know how old you are 
but it seems to me like the last uh newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was walter cronkite 
hum 
so i do n't i do n't know if you 're familiar with him or not 
no 
not really you know 
in the last few years just his kind of informal segments i 've seen 
but i never got to see his actual nightly news 
i liked 
i- i did grow up with david brinkley uh 
well brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold of cronkite 
uh-huh 
and he did a a pretty good job 
the huntley brinkley report was quite excellent over the years 
yeah 
we we used to watch um him and i guess john chancellor 
and i always liked david brinkley 
and i- and i used to enjoy john chancellor 's style of reporting 
but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary 
and that 's where i get get into the problem with with him 
i frequently disagree with his commentaries 
so 
well once they 've reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore 
right 
what did you think of the news coverage of the war 
well i almost felt like it was too much 
indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening 
um-hum 
uh i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst 
really 
and i do n't need their fill-ins you know 
did that help you understand a lot what was going on your your prior experience with the military did 
yes 
but i- i think it helps me everyday in trying to review wh- the state that the world is in and try to guess where we 're going 
i wondered if it would help you sometimes fill-in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people people like myself might not pick up on 
well i- i think uh my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with sixty minutes 
okay 
what weekly um magazine do you look at 
is it 
i like us news and world report 
at one time or another i 've taken them all for a year 
uh-huh 
i believe in giving anything a chance 
sure 
uh but i keep coming back to that one 
so i that 's kind of my favorite 
does it give a pretty good overview of everything 
or like does it give um i guess little encapsulated reports and and then a few big stories 
it 's primarily um a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports 
yeah 
uh here 's what went on in asia over the past week 
and there 's maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs unless that was one of their the focus of their main stories 
that sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary real quick 
uh it too is one those you know 
in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways 
and i do most of my reading in the bathroom 
right 
um and it 's one of those that i can ei- read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i 'm going to spend in there 
right 
and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days 
well we 're working on a newsweek uh 
for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory subscription 
so we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like glamour or sports illustrated 
so we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us so to speak 
well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway 
it can n't hurt 
well anytime that we stop and think it can n't hurt 
no 
i- i even i enjoy reading t news 
i try to catch it because it 's another example 
they just they just show you the words and the facts 
and they they do n't offer any commentary 
and it gives me a quick chance to to be caught up during the day because you know we do n't listen to the radio at work at all 
so i do n't like to go the whole day without hearing anything 
oh i 'm with you 
i have to check t news every everyday 
it 's my noontime dose of facts 
yeah 
and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um talking fingers 
do you have that 
no 
you have different telephone numbers that you can dial 
and then you dial in an access code 
and it will depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update it will give you um updated information 
so it can give you you know current news updates current weather updates things like that 
and it 's it 's offered through the local phone company free of charge 
so that 's an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use 
hum 
well it does sound very interesting 
it it really is yeah it really is nice i mean because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about 
maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that 
so that is something you might keep your eyes open for 
i think it 's it 's catching on throughout the country 
okay 
okay 
so what do you think about it 
should 
um i like the idea of nursing homes as a as a growing choi- the choices you have in nursing homes now whereas used to you used to have only you put you know 
when when people got to the point where they were debilitated and could n't take care of themselves and there was no other choice 
uh-huh 
you could n't take them in your own home 
then they went into a nursing home 
you know maybe you lived too far away to care for them 
right 
or your daily job or whatever prevented it 
but um i like the choices you have now where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some basically have a independent lifestyle but assisted care 
yeah 
and then if things deteriorate they can go to a second level which is you know like where they prepare their meals for them and and they still live somewhat independently 
uh-huh 
but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals 
uh-huh 
and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care you know where some people can n't where they 're in a wheelchair or where they 're in a bed 
uh-huh 
and they can n't get around 
but then they have full care 
but i really like those those options now 
and and i think about it more often because my husband 's parents are they 're very active right now 
but they 're seventy five and and seventy two 
so that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things because of their age 
uh-huh 
yes 
um it 's it 's funny 
because um i know people at that are in all three and people that work you know 
i know someone that w- works in all three different stages like you said 
uh-huh 
and i have known you know people close to me that have been in all three 
and i have seen them like go from where they 're in an apartment building 
they we call it um 
well we have high rises 
and it 's just for elderly people you know 
or most of most of one of their spouses has already passed away 
uh-huh 
and it 's really nice for them because then they 're with people their own age and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through 
uh-huh 
and it 's it 's really nice to go and see them you know where they can still get around and everything 
and they still you know do their own thing 
but it 's it 's really nice to see them because 
i mean sometimes 
like i had a great aunt 
she lived with us for um three months and because she 's starting to get alzheimer 's disease 
and i know i have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters 
and i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to to actually sit down because she does n't like doing things that the younger kids like doing 
uh-huh uh-huh right 
and to actually sit 
so it 's really nice to see that 
yeah 
that 's some of the things i would find important before i i would look into that for a person is is is like you 're saying a good mix of people who have the same interests 
uh-huh 
and uh and the programs 
here they have different uh besides just different levels within the same program they have different types of programs 
they have several areas 
they have one area in town where the people 
i guess a lot of it comes with money 
it this this one area is a bit more expensive 
and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life 
but but things that people where they have similar interests 
uh-huh 
like you 're saying 
and the programs that they have where where some of them will have dances once a week and some of them sponsor different crafts 
yeah 
and they go to the arboretum to see things 
and they make sure that if they want to go to church there 's a bus there 
uh-huh 
and it 'll or you know or someone will transport them to a specific church even though it 's you know maybe it 's thirty minutes away 
because it 's a big you know dallas area is a big metropolitan area 
yeah 
but a lot of these places have have churches or have have individual transportation 
that 's that 's something i 'd look for something that would make me happy personally if i had to live there 
uh-huh 
because i do n't think a lot of people really even in the nice ones and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently they really do n't necessarily like it because they 're not in their own home 
yeah 
uh-huh 
so i think those kinds of things to make it more home like and to make it more um enjoyable for them that 'd that 'd be one thing i 'd look for along with the uh health care aspects to make sure they had you know that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses 
uh-huh 
yeah 
um i 'm in college 
and i 'm i 'm only twenty one 
but we had a spee- i had a speech class last semester 
and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly 
uh-huh 
and i was so surprised to hear how many people 
like whenever they 're in you know the older people they 're like um fastened to their beds so they can n't get out just because they you know they wander the halls and they get the wrong medicine just because you know the the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and so many of them you know are 
are overmedicated too 
yes 
and it was it was awful to hear what you know what some of these people really went through 
and i forget the percentage of people that you know that she had said 
and this was i mean she did research on it and everything 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that 's one of the things that that we do n't think about as we get older and the the money that it now requires to uh be in one of these places 
because some of these people that are just on social security 
and if they do n't have any living relatives 
perhaps they never had children 
or if their children you know passed away before they did they can be in some places that are you know that that are not good 
uh-huh 
yeah 
where they they have very minimum minimal care 
and the the care that they are getting the people who are giving it are pro- are paid at a minimum wage 
and they just do they do n't care as much 
yeah 
and and like you said they 're trying to make it the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they 're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they 'll stay in one spot and not do anything 
uh-huh 
that certainly would be something to to watch for 
because you 've got with some of them being some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in 
i know 
and some and sometimes they share a room 
and it 's just a little cubbyhole 
fee yeah 
and they share it with another person 
and they 're still paying that much 
oh yeah 
so you 've 
it it it just sometimes it just seems ridiculous 
yeah 
you 've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care what kind of level of care you need and then what you can unfortunately what you can afford at the same time 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
um i 've been lucky 
well my mom 's um parents they 're both in their in their uh eighties 
and i was just home for spring break 
and my grandma said something to me about she goes well maybe we 'll just sell the house 
she said it 's getting too big for us to take care of 
and i was like no 
no 
no 
stay in the house as long as you can 
well like there are other communities too that are n't necessarily a nursing home 
i had an aunt who lived in a small town in texas that um was in a 
it was a it was a housing division 
each person had their own little bitty house that they had built 
uh-huh 
and it was um supplemented 
their they were most of them were on social security 
and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government 
but it was this little bitty one bedroom house 
but it was a separate house 
and they had a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen and a bathroom 
oh 
so they still had they had and they had people who came in who um supervised th- all these houses 
were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block 
uh-huh 
and they had a a supervisory um 
was n't a house really 
it was it was more like a a headquarters or something anyway where they they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone if they needed someone they could ring 
it sounds like uh an apartment or some 
and and someone could come to their house 
oh 
yeah 
and that and they always cooked 
then they had they had the choice you know 
they lived in their own little house 
uh-huh 
they had their own possessions still in there to some ex- you know some of them 
uh-huh 
and they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to and their own dinner 
and they always had somebody come in for lunch 
but they had people who did you know they did n't have to mess with the yard 
uh-huh 
they had people who did the yard 
and they had a maid that uh uh service that came in and cleaned everybody 's house 
so they did n't have to worry about that 
oh yeah 
and it was really a nice it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own house 
uh-huh 
and she still had her own couch and her own bed 
and it it really helped a lot 
and she was a lot more comfortable 
and she did n't yeah 
oh really 
see now we 've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were 
well i 've lived here for thirty years 
yeah 
and we 've built this and this is our home 
and we have nothing else to show for our lives 
and we do n't want to leave 
oh yeah 
uh we 've run into a lot of that 
yeah 
it would be hard to 
um 
that 's that 's why this 
she was she felt that way too 
but when it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff 
yeah 
and i guess that that 
it was a pilot program i think where she lived 
so it 's probably not widely available 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that 's what like 
well um now i know we have an old 
we call it an old folks home 
but it 's basically a nursing home too 
but everyone has basically their own room 
yeah 
and they 're allow you know th- 
none of them have cars because they can n't drive 
uh-huh 
but if someone would come to get them you know they 're allowed to leave with them 
and there 's a staff there that makes supper for them 
and each person has a chore 
like maybe wednesday night it 's george 's turn to set all the tables 
huh 
and it 's really nice because that keeps them going too rather than just sitting around 
yeah 
and i know um our youth group goes over 
and we play bingo with them and you know like stuff like that 
well that 's good 
everybody needs some sense of responsibility 
uh-huh 
an even even if it 's just a little bit 
yeah 
just to keep them going 
yeah 
uh-huh 
so it 's it 's more like living with a big in a big house where it 's your turn to to set the table like you 're saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that would be nice 
but i think before i- 
like you i do n't think y- i do n't think it 's right to just put someone in it 
i think they would have to agree to go in it 
yes 
unless they 're at a point where they 're mentally incapaci- 
well yeah 
say like you 're saying with alzheimer 's and going to be the people who have to be there 
uh-huh 
that 's when it 's important to really check out the medical aspects of it when you 're when you 're in something like that that they 'll get the kind of medical care they want without or overdoing it so 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
uh-huh 
okay 
so who 's your uh favorite team 
who do you think 
the dallas cowboys 
the dallas cowgirls huh 
yeah 
well they did have a fairly decent year finally this year 
um-hum 
at least they 're coming around 
yeah 
they 're going to get better 
i mean you know 
well i mean you know i think uh once jimmy johnson gets his system established uh they 'll do all right 
yeah 
as long as troy aikman does n't get hurt again 
that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year 
um-hum 
so i do n't i do n't even know who your favorite team is actually 
i 'm a viking fan 
okay 
i think i did know that i just forgot 
okay 
and they have n't been doing too hot 
so 
yeah 
has herschel walker done much for them 
no 
in fact in fact the cowboys got the best end of that deal 
definitely 
well he was a good player i guess 
i do n't know 
he just never 
i do n't know 
for a while there 
i 've never been over impressed with him 
he just well he could always get past you know he 'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone 
but um i guess you never could really see him play because with the cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor 
so you could n't really tell if it was just him or the team 
and i always just assumed he was too good for the rest of the team 
but i do n't know 
well who 's the running 
back is it sammy smith 
or is it emmitt smith 
emmitt smith 
yeah 
emmitt smith 
he 's been doing real good 
i 'm pretty impressed with him so far 
yeah 
did he did he actually play in the pro bowl 
i remember he was like a backup 
and then somebody got injured 
and he was supposed to go 
i 'm not sure 
yeah 
i kind of i have n't been keeping up with football i mean in the fall 
i- i can go on and on about football 
but since it 's kind of off season it 's kind of hard to think back about all that 
but uh 
uh who else is uh uh 
there 's you know mike lynn from the 
minnesota vikings he used to be the general manager starting the world football league 
yeah 
some uh and th- and he was trying to keep uh uh 
uh i can n't even think of the guy 's name either the coach of the vikings 
um i have no idea 
burt 
jerry burns 
no earthly idea 
going to keep he was going to keep him as the coach somehow 
but uh i do n't know 
i 'd like to see the vikings get revamped somehow 
how did they end up this year 
did they did they make it to the play-offs at all 
well they started out really bad 
they went like one and six 
and then they won five or six in a row 
um 
so they were in a shot to make the play-offs 
and they screwed up the last couple of games 
um-hum kind of like the cowboys huh 
yep 
i guess you can 
except i think the cowboys are on the upswing 
i do n't know about the vikings 
yeah 
just had n't heard much about them lately 
and the cardinals were kind of like the cow- 
in fact they were doing better than the cowboys 
and the cowboy cowboys came on strong at the end of the season 
and the cardinals got killed by the cowboys 
so 
yeah 
well the cardinals i do n't know 
i think the cowboys probably have a a better team 
they just 
at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with aikman getting hurt because uh laufenberg just could n't never really get it together at all 
of course he sat along the sidelines all season 
he never really got in a game never did a whole lot 
oh do n't make any excuses for him 
well i 'm just saying i should n't i should n't blast him like that say oh well laufenberg got out there and blew it for them 
i mean he did n't get to see much action but it 's too bad 
because now now you know he had a shot and and did n't look too good 
and so no one is going to have much faith in him any more 
um-hum 
in fact i think they 're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback 
i have n't uh i have n't kept up with it lately 
but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody 
but it was n't anybody i 'd really heard of 
but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh aikman 's back in practicing doing real real well 
um who is it michael irvin he said that uh aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time 
uh-huh 
so sounds like he 's going to be all right for next season 
they 're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder uh back in shape 
it was his shoulder was n't it that he had problems with 
i do n't know 
yeah 
think it was 
i think it i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on 
but anyway they 're trying to keep him you know keep him uh from reinjuring anything but anyway 
but uh well i got my uh thirty day notice yesterday 
thirty day notice for what 
um i 'm done where i work 
oh really 
so anyway i guess we can n't talk much more about that 
but i just thought i 'd throw that in there 
what 
oh okay 
maybe i 'll call you back after after the recording is finished 
actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes 
i- i can n't remember 
oh we 
i 've always ran out of time ever since i 've done this 
really 
i usually have too 
they always say you 've talked your ten minute limit 
yeah 
i 've done that once or twice 
i did n't look at the clock when we started talking 
so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in 
make sure we get our cash flow 
yeah 
so other than the vikings who do you like 
um actually when i was younger i was a cardinal fan too 
uh oh 
remember jim hart 
jim hart was playing 
terry metcalf was on the cardinals 
this was a long time ago 
yeah 
uh i do n't know who else i 've ever 
that 's about it 
i was always a viking fan 
i think i was into the cardinals for a little bit 
and 
um-hum 
back when they were in saint louis 
and yeah 
oh of course 
since they 've been to phoenix they have n't been uh all that impressive i guess 
i guess i 've always been a cowboy fan 
other than that i mean you know when i 've you know when you grow up in a city that has the you know one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kind of tend to get caught up in it 
yeah 
well the cowboys were america 's football team 
yeah 
there 's no question about that 
so 
yeah 
i mean it it was really exciting growing up when when the cowboys were really big 
because my parents would always have season tickets 
and they 'd go to all the games 
and you know the hype were just unbelievable 
it 's just you know the last oh 
i guess probably since about eighty four about eighty five was when they started kind of going downhill really 
but you know i 'm just used to always growing up and hearing cowboys cowboys cowboys and you know super bowl and all this other stuff 
so i can n't you know 
i 'm not going to decide i do n't like them just because they 're having a few bad years 
i mean i think they 'll pull out of it 
and you know they 'll they 'll wind up being good again 
they 've got some lot of really good young players that are going to that are going to uh do pretty good i think 
but they 're raising prices on their tickets 
so they 're banking on doing good next season 
i think tickets are 
again 
yeah 
what are they going up to thirty bucks or something 
thirty or thirty two for really good tickets 
see they they sectioned it out even more 
they used to just have like uh 
first of all it was all one price 
and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else 
and now they 're sectioning it off to like from the from one twenty yard line to the other one 
just on the lower levels is the highest price 
and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level 
and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line 
and then they 're some sections kind of in the corner areas 
and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones 
but um they have about four or five different prices now 
that they 're structuring it with 
but obviously yeah they 're all going up even more or less is what it 's going to do 
so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year 
um you know i 'm not sure 
i 'm not positive 
i did n't i did n't really think about that 
i just remember trying to figure out where you could get 
that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper 
but not that i 'll ever go 
i had n't been to a cowboys game 
last time last time i went to the cowboys game was during that um nfl strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there 
and it was the uh dallas and washington redskins game 
and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets 
and they um if they 're not going to use them they 'll give them to somebody else 
so my dad i went with my dad to a game that one time 
but that was n't a real you know 
it was it was the scab teams 
it was kind of you know it was kind of different i guess 
and before that it 's been quite a few years 
i 've been wanting to go to a game 
i just never never have gotten around to it 
so maybe this year 
that 's interesting 
i almost lost our electricity here 
texans cheap cheaper i guess 
hello 
hello there 
did i reach the dallas area 
i beg your pardon 
did i reach the dallas area 
nope 
you 've reached dayton ohio 
dayton ohio 
i 'm from north carolina 
oh you 're from north carolina 
where in north carolina 
in raleigh 
raleigh 
great 
yeah 
so 
my name 's mary 
my name is fernando 
fernando glad to know you 
so um do you work 
how 'd you find out about this 
uh i was visiting my son down in dallas 
and 
oh okay 
he works for ti 
uh no 
no 
but his wife has a contract with ti 
and that 's how we learned about it 
um-hum 
oh okay 
because i 'm down at nc state 
yeah 
um-hum 
and so i took a class 
and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes 
right 
so are you ready 
i 'm ready 
okay 
let 's get started 
all right 
okay 
okay 
so uh what do you think uh that uh 
wh- what wh- what do you think we can do to solve the crime in america 
oh if i knew that i 'd be a very wealthy person 
yeah 
but what what what are the steps 
well you have to see 
i a as the way i look at it you have to think first of all why 
or has has crime increased 
and if so why has crime increased 
well see the problem is is that um what happens is as that you 're uh you know as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right 
um-hum 
because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people 
right 
and so as as 
and the people in the country do n't want as much as the people in the city 
um-hum 
now what happens is all those that do n't have any money in the country move to the cities 
and they wish to get the same thing 
they say why can n't we have the same things that these other people have 
and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs 
and what we have to do is we have to go there get some stuff steal it and then you know resell it 
it 's easy 
you said the magic word there 
which one 
drugs 
yeah 
and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased 
that 's uh that 's uh the main reason i think uh everywhere 
because uh you have deaths 
i mean i mean you have murders 
and you have you know people stealing other people 's stuff 
and that 's 
a lot of it has to do with drugs 
oh yes 
it does n't have to do 
i mean the thing is is that you know it 's like you might be standing somewhere right 
and like let 's say you 're you you go you know you 're driving out 
and you 're driving back home 
and it 's late at night 
and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints 
yeah 
and uh somebody walks in there with a gun 
i mean they 're going to want the money 
and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs 
i mean they do n't want the money so uh so they can do something else with it 
now 
they do n't want the money for food 
that 's for sure 
right 
right 
and so 
well but you know the the strange thing uh perhaps not strange but something that many people do n't realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty one and fifty two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids 
because uh i 'm a retired educator 
um-hum okay 
and uh in fifty one and fifty two the police came to the high school where i was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started and so on and so on 
yeah 
so it 's a problem that 's been around for over forty years 
and we 're just really uh uh now trying to uh figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge 
yeah 
there 's a there 's a a song that i know which says you know that 
it 's like in uh nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine the local state and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in america 
and uh i their figures i think are true so 
i mean it 's like compared to you know compared to weapons and stuff like that i mean you 're spending nothing on on crime in the country itself 
what you 're doing is you you know 
it 's like you have other things you know 
it 's like you have the aids 
we 're going to solve try to solve the aids problem while while you know some people are getting killed here and there 
hm uh-huh 
and then 
you 
know the uh another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers the big dealers in drugs may be may be part of the power structure that 's keeping us from spending the money in that direction 
uh-huh 
but those people never get caught 
the people that that that i 
that 's right 
they 'll never get caught 
see their theory is that if i 'm surrounded and i 'm going to be caught i 'm going to try to pry my way through 
and they 're not going to take me alive 
um-hum 
but i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me 
that 's right 
but they 'll 
you know it 's like 
of course i mean i might be you know the the leading drug dealer here 
but you wo n't find me dealing in drugs 
i mean there 's no connection between me and the people that you caught you know 
that 's right 
that 's right 
then 
one person does n't know the other person down the line 
right 
but the guy at the very top the one who 's who 's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure uh the uh and had the political uh pull to keep things from uh keep the interest or the uh emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing 
yeah 
because it sure is monstrous in this country 
yeah 
i was i was at a at a party on saturday 
and this guy comes up 
he goes hey how you doing whatever and then 
he started talking to me 
and this guy was from jamaica right 
um-hum 
and he 's got his little brother selling drugs 
um-hum 
you know and he goes yeah i just came up here to work 
and i go oh you did i bet you make uh very good money up here 
he goes yeah i make a lot a lot of money 
he goes you know 
and uh in the movie good fellas 
yeah 
right 
did you see it 
nope 
i only heard about it 
okay 
in one part the guy goes out of jail 
and within uh two months he had all his house payments done everything paid and you know 
um-hum 
and he had enough money to you know 
it 's like those guys at one point you know they had so much money that they did n't know what to do with it 
yeah 
well you know 
even in our prison systems they 're finding that they 're they 're having drugs smuggled into them 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's that that was also in the movie 
right 
yeah 
so hello mary 
it 's been nice talking 
we 've been talking for five minutes 
i beg your 
we 've been talking for a little bit 
i appreciate the call 
i enjoyed talking with you 
it was all right okay 
same here 
uh-huh 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
okay 
i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute 
okay 
well credit cards boy that 's an easy topic 
is it yes 
is n't it 
it is 
it 's one we all hold dear and near i 'm sure 
oh yes 
yes 
i guess i 've had some good experience and some bad experience with them 
yeah 
most of mine 's been pretty good although i 'm i guess i 'm like a lot of other people now 
i 'm trying to to pay off my credit cards 
and i 've done pretty good at it 
yeah 
uh-huh 
well i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want 
you now not need want 
uh-huh 
there is a big difference 
there 's a big difference there 
yeah 
yeah 
but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline 
yeah 
oh yeah 
i i do that 
i do that 
but the rest like i said the rest of them i 've been trying to to pay off and uh get back on a cash basis except for gas 
uh-huh 
it 's too easy to to run into the gas station 
oh it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way 
yeah 
what you uh-huh 
at least that 's for me 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
so 
but yeah 
i 've i 've talked to some who 's really had some bad experience 
and kind of knock on wood i have n't yet not bad 
yeah 
well 
you know i just i 'm just shocked at the end of the month to see what damage i have did 
but i try to keep it pretty reasonable 
yeah 
yeah 
well i 've been pretty lucky in that respect 
i do n't charge like i say i 've i been trying to to not charge except for emergencies 
uh-huh 
so but i have n't really had any bad problems with credit cards 
there 's you know 
they have uh wonderful features 
they 're there when you need them you know like in emergencies or whatever 
yeah 
huh 
and then they have bad drawbacks too i mean high interest 
yeah 
they ta- talks with 
it 's like paying twice 
that 's true 
that 's true 
yes 
so 
i try to 
i did switch to one uh sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest yeah compared to some of the other ones 
but oh uh-huh 
yeah 
yeah 
and you do n't have an annual fee there 
and that helps 
oh yes 
uh we used to have you know like several 
but right now we 're just more or less at american express you know 
yeah uh-huh 
and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in 
yeah 
that 's one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well i 'll just pay on it this month 
yeah 
pay fifteen 
yeah 
and 
yes 
i know 
yeah 
yeah 
and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time 
takes a long time 
that 's right 
it sure does 
and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax that 's you know 
uh-huh 
of course it 's been going down for a number of years 
but this is the last year you can take anything 
so 
but yeah uh-huh 
yeah 
so 
well i 've enjoyed talking to you 
well i 've enjoyed talking to you 
and maybe we 'll get to talk again 
okay 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
i 've kind of gotten out of the habit of doing this 
it 's sort of been down this weekend 
well i have n't tried 
but this is 
i have n't called in a couple of days 
but education in public schools 
i have a son who 's graduating uh in may 
and there 's some interesting problems of of of how do you how do you challenge the kids today 
and i have some real hang-ups 
i think that uh if your if your kid 's not ambitious he can sure get lost 
in the school systems 
yes 
that 's right 
what school system does he go to 
in north garland 
he goes t- 
okay 
what school system are you familiar with 
okay 
my children go to garland 
and i teach in dallas 
oh 
oh okay 
well i have a daughter that 's in the in in the ib program at garland 
and my husband teaches with plano 
in the what 
in the 
a- are you familiar with the international baccalaureate program 
well yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
uh do your kids go to garland high you say 
no 
no 
they 're still in elementary 
oh okay 
so yeah 
well there 's a 
it 's um 
she went from austin academy when it opened up over to uh to north garland for ninth grade 
uh-huh 
but at north garland the the difficulty i see with the education system is that uh is that you can you can you can get some masses 
but u- unle- if the kid 's really dedicated it seems like they do all right 
but if if if your child is just pressing along uh 
i i 'm firmly convinced that teachers are n't being paid enough 
would you argue with that 
i 'm definitely not 
are you kidding 
no 
well you know the the the thing that i do n't see and i i maybe you would take issue with it is that if if we went to if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around 
no 
i want that 
well would 
i think it would be better for the teachers and for the children because we would do away with so much of the burn out that we have 
i know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school then it 's like they 've lost so much ground we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up reteaching what they had the year before you know 
well how do we acco- how do we get that 
well we 're starting pilot schools 
it 's a 
dallas is doing it i know 
i think plano do n't they have some 
and richardson 's supposed to start some pilot schools going to school year around 
yeah 
and then we you know we investigated this by flying some people out from dallas to observe some of the schools in california that already had it 
does it work well out there 
yeah 
it seems to 
and one thing it 'll save us money because we 've got the buildings sitting there 
right 
and we might as well use them 
well what about the what about the issue of air conditioning 
is n't that a a a area of concern in the cost of air conditioning 
well air conditioning what 's and and heating 
oh yeah 
is n't air conditioning less than heating because we have to just up 
like if we get in the thirties we raise it up to the seventies 
right 
that 's forty degrees 
i yeah 
is n't it less 
yeah 
it 's it 's less degree days 
you 're right 
but i think i think 
and it 's not going to be like the kids are going to go a lot longer 
really if you go year around there 's not thirty days difference 
clearly yeah 
well how do they do it 
do they put uh long do they put two or three week breaks between 
there 's different ways to do it 
like i i think going two six weeks and then having two two weeks off each after a two w- six weeks period is one way 
is that from from what you 've seen is that the desirable way to do it 
see i do n't know because i 've never seen it in action 
oh you said you had some people from california 
oh i thought you 
well no 
the school system in dallas has sent people there to do that 
oh okay 
no 
but you did n't go 
but i think i 'd like it 
and i know a lot of teachers that would like to try it 
well the the other issue has to do that i hear that the local commentator i listen to david golsome some the idea that the numbers of administrations and the fact that the principal 
do you see that the principals are n't really in charge 
the principal 's their t- hands are tied by all the administrators 
and i heard that in dallas it 's one out of every three is actually in the classroom of the educators that were hired 
well i had heard that one of the comments when they when they brought it 
and that 's just it 's just 
you do n't even know who all your bosses are 
it 's ridiculous 
hum the one of the 
the one they brought in the new uh superintendent for dallas schools the adminis- um 
can n't think of his name 
but the idea that yeah that he had suggested that that maybe they could reduce the number of administrators and and some of the people who were administrators saying that that uh that that 's not what he was hired for 
marvin edwards 
but they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there 
well you know he did supposedly cut administrators 
but what they 've done is create other offices for those same people and just rehi- renamed their jobs and you know opened up -nother -nother things 
hum 
one thing we 've got going is called reading and initiative 
and they 've hired all these administrators in on that you know 
well the you know the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it co- that it took to contest the the football um issue 
pass or no fail uh what is it 
yeah 
but the i can n't think of the name of the school that that uh 
no play 
no play 
but in any event they they they kept arguing 
carter high school 
that yeah 
yeah 
and they went to court 
i mean uh you know 
i guess i 'm i 'm sympathetic with the kids 
but but how much money did that cost dallas to to to to fight that in court 
and all the things that dallas fights costs thousands probably millions of dollars i bet you 
but just think of all the them all the lawyers you 've kept employed 
see 
yeah 
i know 
and psychologists and stuff 
that 's ri- that 's right 
that 's right 
and and all these other people and out running around 
i i guess that 's the only problem with jobs is being relatively scarce 
so but you need to keep all these people employed right 
no 
we do not 
and and 
no 
you mean you mean we need a little more of our tax money like maybe uh 
we need more of the tax money to actually get down to the students because i- it 's pretty frustrating when you see you do n't even have paper and you 're trying to ration it you know 
now that 's sad when there 's supposed to be what you know one thousand what sixty five dollars something like that spent on each pupil 
yeah 
um it 's it 's wrong 
anyway i was thinking about 
one thing that 's wrong with schools is that we 're not teaching to the children 's modalities 
and i think in nineteen uh ninety three we 're supposed to begin that 
if if a child is a visual learner we 're supposed to present him with all these visual things 
and if he has to learn just by kinesthetic we 're supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it learns the best way 
and that 's going to be quite a problem 
well oh that 's 
but if we could do something like that i 'm sure it would certainly help 
hum that 's interesting 
and how many administrators is that going to take 
i do n't know 
no telling 
i do n't know 
and you know at non graded schools 
they 've had one in gladewater for years and years and years 
if we could just let these kids go at their own rate 
i have children even 
i i teach chapter one 
and it 's for kids that have fallen behind in their reading according to like itbs scores 
yeah 
and some of the kids really they should n't be in there 
and they 're you know they 're not being challenged 
and they 're not being challenged in their home 
and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road 
yeah 
well that 's that 's part of where my son is um 
would like to go to rice 
but i do n't think he 's 
well the the difficulty is is is the people that get in are are are overachievers 
um-hum 
and he 's not an overachiever 
but the same time everybody can n't go 
but 
the question of of you know of of how far should you take a kid in the motivation 
i 'm not sure 
i think maybe there 's too much responsibility put on the teachers to motivate these kids 
i had a a friend that was administrator in richardson and said if the parents read books then the kids probably would read books 
right 
but that a lot of the schools i would think the kids you 're talking to question of of how much reading do those kids parents do 
my children 's parents are n't even there at night most of the time to do anything with them 
well 
well but that 's the point as i would say uh and that 's that 's what makes 
yeah 
there 's a lot of problems 
but anyway um i 'm trying to think how much longer 
i had a conversation week or so ago 
and we got carried away 
and they cut 
it beeps in at ten minutes 
so so anyway 
i know it 
i know it 
i went for a couple 
and i did n't know that there there was even a cut off or anything 
oh another things that 's wrong with schools 
this is big 
there 's too much emphasis on test 
we 're spending the first hour of everyday teaching for the test at my school 
and we 're going to do that until at least the first part of may 
yeah 
hm well see that 's the thing in the garland schools 
the numbers 
they i do n't think they have to do that because most everybody passes 
but see they 're not in dallas 
well opportunity right 
see if you get graded on percent improvement 
but see that- 
it 's yeah 
we 're not working with the same type of students that most of these kids in garland are 
yeah 
and unfortunately the uh that 's that 's tough 
that 's a real challenge though 
but uh 
but see what we 're doing is we 're turning these kids off to school even more than they are 
yeah 
and we 're not teaching toward the test 
we 're teaching you know 
always objectives you know 
it 's like there 's not a whole lot of you know fun time like we used to have in school 
like our principal says i want every child to be on task all the time 
yeah 
and you can n't do that as adults 
but we 're expecting kids to 
and like after after recess play we do n't get that 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
if they finish before their thirty minutes is up then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes probably be the most 
but we always got that did n't you 
well yeah you know 
our s- son had that 
he wa- has had uh attention deficit disorder 
and they were keeping him from recess 
and in reality that 's uh that 's one of those really tough situations 
i think the kids need some time to play 
yeah 
yeah yes that w- 
but nevertheless goo- if if people like if more people like you though that understand the problem get in and maybe we can change some education 
so uh i got some background noise there 
but i guess 
well how do you feel about it 
well uh i do n't have any strong convictions about it 
that 's for sure 
um i know i have n't done any peace corps service 
and i do n't know anybody in my immediate family that has or you know has ever even thought about it 
do you know uh do you know anybody that 's been it 
no 
the the only people i know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries 
and that 's only because i went to baylor 
and a lot of students from baylor go and and serve as missionaries during the summer 
but i think i think that 's a terrible idea 
that 's like forcing someone to donate to a charity 
yeah 
i mean it it 's nice to to try to teach young people some some uh uh civil uh consciousness but forcing them to to donate basically their time and efforts 
yeah 
it 's definitely up to the person uh 
so i 'd have to say that uh it you know the people who do it well some feel it 's rewarding 
i do n't know you know 
but uh i do n't know how we got the subject 
it it 
i do n't either 
you know i have nothing to say about this 
i do n't either 
i was i almost hung up because i thought well gosh i do n't i do n't really have an opinion except for no 
i think that 's dumb 
um-hum 
but uh 
well how long you been in san antonio 
i 've been here for um just uh almost five y- well no almost four years 
okay 
and i lived with dana in school 
okay 
that 's how we know each other 
and uh you you were just up there then huh 
uh-huh 
last weekend we went to six flags saturday 
uh oh okay 
yeah a good old time 
well that 's good 
well back to the topic at hand 
what other types of community service would they be talking about 
i mean the the recording mentioned the peace corps 
well it sounded like i mean this is like maj- long term commitment like a year or six months 
yeah 
or so you 're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe 
or you know i do n't know 
i mean but uh 
i mean i 'm all for donating my time to worthy causes 
like i do some volunteer work here and there 
and every once in a while i 'll do uh a uh local big brother big sister thing 
um-hum 
or i 'll go you know do a 
but that that time is minuscule compared to what what it sound like they were referring to 
yeah 
yeah 
i i could n't possibly commit a year or two of my life to to go do something 
yeah 
yeah 
they could n't cover my hourly rate 
i could n't afford it 
no kidding 
but uh 
i have this thing against bugs too 
and seems to me like the peace corps 
they send you someplace that there 's a lot of bugs 
yeah 
africa 
a lot of yeah 
have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything 
i 'd probably catch a terrible disease and die 
yeah 
well i doubt that 
but you know i guess 
well i i mean it would it would have to be tough going somewhere you do n't know the culture usually i guess 
yeah 
i think that maybe that 's why some people do it is uh to see the other cultures or you know and some of that 
um-hum 
but uh to do that i do n't know 
i 'd have to be 
i do n't know 
oh i do n't know either 
the o- growing up all i knew was you go to high school you you know you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work 
and and none of this you go spend two years in the peace corps to ex- to broaden your horizons 
oh um-hum well you know uh i know american expre- 
i 'm no- i 'm working at american express now 
and they 
after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off like six months or something for some type of sabbatical or some you know some something like that 
uh-huh 
and they 're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off 
uh-huh oh 
so it is something that i think uh you know even the larger organizations will support 
uh it 's r- it 's really for the community to give you know to to give back to the community type of thing 
i do n't know 
pre- it 's for yeah i think at the same time it 's for some people to you know help them grow in other areas 
i 'm for kind of like joining the military 
well i mean in that respect a lot of people join the military to to grow up and to decide what they want to do 
yeah 
m- 
and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as as that kind of a time 
yeah 
maybe a little bit in that perspective 
but uh i know a lot of people that have gone in the military i mean i- you know when they 're in the college 
sometimes it 's to su- help support college you know the money 
um-hum 
uh others people do n't know what they want to do 
but as far as uh you know the peace corps i guess i suppose there 's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives 
but i think a lot of it 's you know when the people get older they 'll do something like that 
i 'd probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that had gone into the peace corps 
yeah 
but i do n't 
i- i i do n't 
and none of my 
did n't mean to cut you off there 
oh that 's okay 
n- and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything 
so i do n't really know anyone first hand that 's that 's comm- committed a chunk of their life to do service work 
uh i 
everybody i know has been 
well i 'm going to go get a j- good job and make some money and buy a nice car 
so 
know or tr- or try to make a living 
yeah 
but uh 
yeah 
i i have no i do n't know anybody that 's that done that either 
so i it 's 
it 's interesting we got this topic because i i i do n't know what i marked off to get this 
but 
i certainly did n't mark off anything to get this one 
i c- i can n't imagine 
and the switchboard 's been down for several days 
and the last time i called it before it went down i had this topic 
and i did n't feel like talking about it 
so i hung up 
and i guess they they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it 
so you had the same one huh 
yeah 
oh well well you you 'll get it over with here 
i know 
how many times have you talked 
it oh probably five or six 
yeah 
not a whole lot 
oh i 've done maybe four or five 
yeah 
did dana sign you up for this 
well she just sent me the information out 
i i got a hold of it you know 
i just sent it back in 
and 
yeah 
that 's 
she stuck my name on some list 
so they mailed me the information that i filled out 
what other topics have you had 
well that 's pr- um i 've talked about camping with someone 
i 've talked about the weather 
great 
great 
that one was interesting because i talked to a man in in washington dc 
and it was hot here 
and it was snowing there 
so that was pretty interesting 
um-hum 
and i talked to someone about the uh the uh education system 
i forget exactly what the focus was on that one 
but that was fairly interesting 
and i 've talked to somebody about credit card usage 
yeah 
and and i talked to this person who i gathered from speaking to her that that she and her family just did n't have much 
and they did n't have much credit available to them 
um-hum 
and so she basically did n't use credit cards and did n't know very much about them and how they work and and how you can use them to your advantage and and how you know you you can do certain things with them 
hm 
yeah 
i always i use everything with my visa 
and i pay it all off 
yeah 
so that 's a good deal for me 
i get free money for thirty days 
yeah 
so that 's the way i use them uh i tr- i try to make sure i do n't get in debt 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
well that 's always a good plan 
i can n't think of anything else that i 've talked about 
all the the m- most of the ones on the list i checked off stuff like football and and stuff that i can i i would enjoy talking about 
and i have n't gotten a one of them yet when i 've called 
i had uh 
let 's see 
i 've had fishing 
and uh i can n't remember me and i think me and dana had football 
yeah 
we did 
oh how funny 
yeah 
uh we so we talked about the cowboys a little bit 
and i 'm out here in phoenix 
so we talked about phoe- cardinals 
um-hum 
and so so that one was all right 
and then what else i had 
i think i had some other uh like staying in shape or working out 
this other guy i got this guy from new york 
so 
i had to talk to someone about hobbies 
and the switchboard called me 
so i was caught a little off guard 
and i could n't think of anything at all 
so i started making stuff up 
i told this woman that my hobby was gardening 
and i can n't even i can n't even grow an ivy 
and you 've probably never gardened in your life 
my grandfather gave me a plant once 
that told and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill 
you could freeze it 
you could you could dry it out 
no matter what you could n't kill it 
well i killed it pretty quick 
yeah 
i do n't i do n't have too much of a green thumb either 
so 
i do have one plant here 
it 's been hanging out for a while 
but i think it 's one of your easiest plants 
i can n't i do n't know the name of it 
but i 'm not too much into 
okay 
i forgot all about that that it had to be pressed 
um but anyway so so as far as 
w- we really we do n't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of tv because we both were raised you know that way you know where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a tv to be the babysitter 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and we just do n't want that 
we want more communication and interaction you know amongst us as a family 
and we both like sports 
so we figured well what what better way to get out and you know be together as a family and also you know have it be good for you 
um-hum 
and plus we like we both like to cook 
so you know that 's something we spend time together too is you know cooking and uh preparing meals and stuff 
so but as far as that that 's about all we 've discussed for family 
really 
okay 
well see i 'm the third oldest of twelve children 
oh my gosh 
and i like so i like i said i 
i 'm only twenty one 
i 'll be twenty two next month 
so there 's nine that are younger than me 
my youngest sister is five 
oh yeah 
and like i s- i do n't have any children 
i 'm just engaged 
and i 'm getting married in october 
and we have n't discussed this at all so um 
yeah 
long way down the road right 
yeah 
exactly 
but um now i 've noticed that like while i 'm at college and when i go home my brothers you know my 
i 'm really close to the younger ones 
and um like wh- wh- like when i do go home they enjoy just l- laying around me you know 
like if we do watch tv at night they just like enjoy just like laying on top of me or something 
yeah 
they like that 
but um as far as that goes like we play games 
i play like old maid and fish with them 
and w- we play board games 
and when it 's ni- 
like i 'm from pennsylvania 
so when it 's nice out we go outside 
and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff 
so we do a lot of that 
um-hum 
and in the summer everyone is like i think there 's like seven of us still at home 
and all seven are in a sport 
like also they 're either in base- the girls are in softball 
and the boys are in baseball 
so all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports 
that 's it you know 
well do do 
so you go if you 're if you 're not doing any kind of sport thing you go to one of your sisters or brothers sporting events and sort of like be there with them 
uh-huh 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
we go and watch 
yeah 
uh-huh 
well that 's that 's good too i mean as far as entering 
i mean you 're you 're participating 
but you 're not you know 
um-hum 
i mean at least you 're encouraging them on and stuff 
and that 's 
yeah 
because um even if our kids you know get into sports that we 're really not interested in i do n't i want them you know to know that we 're still there you know so to speak as a family 
um-hum 
well it 's funny because um well my mom and dad both were kind of athletic 
they both grew up on a farm 
but although you know it was n't them playing i notice like whenever i was playing softball and such my mom and dad got into it more than i did 
i mean they 'd be in the audience screaming and yelling you know 
so 
that yeah 
cheering you on and stuff 
a lot of times the parents get into it just as much as as the kids 
and i found like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff it was really funny because the crowds would like get into argu- you know get into fights who can scream louder and you know everything 
so it 's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it 
and they 're not really even participating 
yeah 
well that that would be fun 
boy so you you have a lot of experience as far you know different ways a family can interact and and do things together as far as 
yeah 
god 
twelve 
um-hum 
but it 's 
so if you 're not 
i- 
what if 
do do people go off in their own little groups with that many 
i mean did like some people go to their rooms and 
yeah 
it 's um 
th- the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real- we really do n't have any privacy when we 're at home because you could n't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms 
yeah 
but um like i say you know i 'm twenty i 'll be twenty two next month 
and i 'm closer to the younger kids than i am the ones my own age 
and that 's i think that 's because well the ones that are older all have their own little thing to do 
hum 
and the younger kids are at home 
and i like to spend time with them 
so i do n't i you know 
yeah 
but when you were growing up and they were n't and the younger ones were n't around what did you do 
we were all pretty close when we were younger 
oh i see 
but now that they 've all sort of moved off 
yeah 
now that we 're getting older people are gett- you know each one of us are going our own direction 
yeah 
uh-huh 
so do you think even 
i mean what did you do when you were younger 
did you go do the board games and stuff 
you still did what you do now 
oh yeah 
and um we you know we had blocks and stuff 
and we just did we would make 
like in the winter when it wa- 
we could n't go outside because of the snow and stuff we um we would um clear out our basement 
um-hum 
and we would like do just even stupid things 
like we try hurtling our couches and stuff you know does 
hurling 
it yeah 
we would just run and jump over the couches 
oh hurtle 
oh okay 
yeah 
to see who could jump over you know 
we just made up our own stupid little games 
and like hide and seek 
well we have a a bigger house than a lot you know 
our house is n't the average small one 
so we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that 
so you you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that y- 
yeah 
well see they 're um we 're all like we 're all pretty close together 
like m- my sister that 's closest to me we 're only fourteen months apart 
yeah 
so there was always there was never just one alone you know 
yeah 
no not real spread in age 
right 
so we were all pretty close where we we always had a buddy to play with you know 
yeah 
gosh twelve 
is that is that pretty common up there uh in 
no 
no 
not at all 
oh okay 
not at all 
because i do n't meet the i mean i do n't speak with many people that come from families that large any more 
i mean my my husband 's mother came from a family of thirteen 
uh-huh 
but i mean that 's his mother you know 
um-hum 
and and they 're catholic 
and and i mean that 's 
well yeah 
i 'm catholic 
well that 's it then i think 
probably maybe that that 
uh-huh 
but i mean do you see yourself having thirteen kids or twelve kids 
no 
not at all 
not at all 
yeah 
but see um when i was younger i used to say that i would like to have five 
well i 've even cut that down now 
and um but to me five was n't even a lot because i was just so used to twelve 
yeah 
you know 
i can imagine but it 's so expensive man 
but yeah 
it 's so it would be really hard now to have twelve children 
i would think for your parents it would be it would still be hard even nowadays i mean just to raise twelve kids 
we- well well okay well like my oldest brother he 's he 's twenty four 
would be 
and he put himself through college 
and um there 's a sister older than me 
she 's still living at home 
but she works you know 
yeah 
and i think she even gives mom and dad a little bit you know of rent money 
yeah 
and i 'm putting myself through college 
and like i 'm getting married in october 
my fiance and i are paying for most of the wedding 
and then then my brother right behind me he moved out 
and he has an apartment 
and he works 
and then the next one down is in the marines 
and he 's out of the house 
so it 's kind of like they do n't you know 
so well sometimes i think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though you know 
i mean you do n't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody so you you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself if you really want it 
i- i think they do 
um-hum 
exactly 
like um well i find it a lot when i 'm up here at college because i 've always had a bank account 
i 've always had my own checking account since i was in like tenth grade 
um-hum 
you know i would work in the summer 
and there 's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or you know to to manage money 
yeah 
like my roommate 's laughing like you know like me you know because th- their schooling 's paid for 
or manage money or know 
yeah 
know you know how to get how to even go about getting money 
yeah 
um-hum 
you know how to get a job or or you know just what you know what when you get a job what your responsibility is 
yeah 
are you going to blow all that money 
how easy it is to blow money you earn 
yeah 
and see and then my mom and dad like whenever w- like we would go out and we would get a summer job 
and then we would start blowing money 
and my mom said well that 's stupid for you to be blowing money 
she goes okay if your going to blow your money on other things she goes you can just pay for your life insurance 
so then we when we all graduated from h- college from high school we all got 
um-hum 
we 're still like i 'm still covered under my mom and dad 's life insurance because i 'm still in school 
but i have my own policy too 
so i had a poli- 
you know my mom and dad got it set up you know you know helped me to get it and everything 
and i have my own policy 
and then i pay for my own life insurance too 
wow 
and then and then like my mom and dad because there 's so many of us and because of the way the laws are you know now if we want to drive we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars 
you 've really got responsibilities 
yeah 
because my mom said that 's silly to let one of the older one 's drive it 
if we were in a wreck you know you can be sued for anything now 
and she said that 's really not fair to the younger kids 
if we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued 
and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad 
and the little kids would have nothing 
and i- i agree with her 
you know i just i do n't know 
yeah 
well 
so if you know if we want to drive we pay our own insurance 
and 
so so really i think sometimes there 's an advantage 
i mean sometimes it 's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent 
um-hum 
you know it makes you know that you can n't take anything for granted and when you get something you 're lucky to get it so to speak you know 
yeah 
um-hum 
so um i do n't know 
um sometimes 
but now it it is hard i can imagine on your parents you know 
cindy have you seen dances with wolves 
no 
i have n't 
have you 
oh that is a wonderful movie 
uh-huh 
it 's not 
the length is n't too long 
no 
uh-huh 
oh goodness no 
oh 
you do n't even you do n't even realize it you know 
well really i 've heard different opinions about it 
uh 
really 
uh-huh 
one that you know 
yeah 
it was too long 
and they thought that you know at certain points that it was going to end 
and it did n't 
and it kept going on 
and 
uh-huh 
oh i thought it was great 
really 
yeah 
now i 've seen you know some different clips of it um 
and it it looks good 
it 's just i have n't had the time to go to the movies lately 
well yeah 
oh i heard a story about there 's a there 's a certain scene in the movie where there 's um where they 're where they 're on a buffalo hunt 
uh-huh 
and they have a particular child actor uh who 's who 's being supposedly run down by a buffalo 
uh-huh 
and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was neil young 's buffalo 
uh-huh 
i can n't remember what they said his name was 
but he has a fetish for oreo cookies 
uh-huh 
oh 
and they got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with oreo cookies 
hey 
that 'd work for me 
let me tell you 
i thought that was really funny 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
now i 've seen another clip of um the guy that plays in murphy brown 
i do n't know his name 
but he 's he played the uh the the character in it that was very like gross i mean very dirty 
an- 
oh yeah 
oh i saw the one clip of him 
and ugh 
it when he was first 
i guess he was taking kevin costner to like the site where he was going to be or whatever 
oh yeah 
that was rather um gross 
yeah 
the wagon the wagon driver 
yeah 
yeah 
but other than that i 've heard the the you know the um the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful 
yeah 
and uh the costuming yeah was 
uh-huh 
really 
the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it did n't that that um the indians all appeared to be wearing new things 
oh really 
and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably you know age to age the material 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
so they they did very authentic reproductions of the of the actual stuff 
the styles 
uh-huh 
but they did n't they did n't age it quite enough it seemed 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but it was a very good movie 
uh-huh 
uh-huh well i guess i will have to see it then 
what have you seen lately 
um actually have been to the movies um 
i think the last movie i saw was misery 
oh i did n't see that 
oh very suspenseful 
i do n't i do n't like stephen king 
i really do n't either 
but i went with someone 
and once i was there i could n't believe 
i mean it 's an excellent movie 
really 
yeah 
i was n't sure 
because uh just generally you know that kind of scary stuff i- i just do n't want to have anything to do with it 
it 's not necessarily it it 's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful 
i mean it 's not 
yeah 
i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something you know 
no 
in in the book apparently she cuts his feet off 
but in the movie she she disables him but not by cutting his feet 
hum 
um she she breaks both of his ankles 
ugh 
and that i could n't watch 
and but you know you could tell when it was coming 
yeah 
so yeah um 
that was so that he could n't leave her 
cause she 
it still just seems a little twisted to me 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean uh yeah 
i 'm not sure i would have enjoyed that at all 
well as far as that goes 
yeah 
i mean you would n't like to see anybo- anything happen to anybody 
but it was just how she got so caught up 
her emotions and you know and and she feel madly in love with this writer 
yeah 
uh-huh 
and it was just 
but she was a killer 
and the the character was you know prior to that had had been someone that had killed other people but no one knew that 
yeah 
oh yeah 
so but 
so yeah 
we just have n't had the time to go to the movies lately 
i know 
we do n't see movies at the movies a lot 
uh-huh 
the last 
we did go see dances with wolves 
and we went to see not without my daughter 
but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape 
and then we rent them 
uh-huh oh right 
right 
now i want to see sleeping with the enemy 
oh yeah that looks really good too 
um 
that yeah it looks good 
and there were a couple others that i just have n't had the time 
and silence of the lambs 
now see i 
i 'm i 'm intrigued by it 
but i 'm not sure i want to go see it yet 
yeah 
i do n't think i want to see that either 
i know 
i do n't i do n't think i could 
i think 
well now we had some friends that went to see it 
and they said it was okay 
really 
so it might not be as 
i think they may be playing up um some aspects of the movie that are n't the main aspects 
really 
uh-huh 
now we went to see the jagged edge 
now suppose that oh well i liked that movie 
and that yeah 
yeah 
so it 's it seems like you know that kind of the thriller suspense and not not real um strange in other ways 
uh-huh 
uh-huh hum 
well i guess that 's about it 
it was nice 
okay 
maybe we 'll talk to you again 
okay 
it was nice talking to you 
alright 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
all right 
last thing i saw was um i think uh sleeping with the enemy with julia roberts 
oh i had n't seen that 
but i 've heard that it 's real good 
my husband did n't like it that much 
i thought it was okay 
it was a little strange you know 
this woman supposedly is um being mentally abused by her husband you know 
he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house 
and she figures out this way to um to leave him secretly 
you know she fakes her death kind of thing 
and he tracks her down 
uh-huh 
oh 
so the the end scenes are are kind of suspenseful you know when she realizes he 's in the house you know after her 
but uh kind of had the feeling along that uh why did n't she just tell him to straighten up 
yeah 
you know why did n't she just tell hi- hey look bucko 
you do n't get away with this nonsense 
oh 
but anyhow um what have you seen 
well last week as a matter of fact my children was on spring break and we went to two movies 
uh-huh 
we went to see awakenings with robin williams 
um 
uh-huh 
and we went to see kindergarten cop 
yeah 
and i really liked both of them 
i really did 
awakening was it was kind of sad to me 
it really was 
and it would it would be to anyone because you know they really do n't know that much about it 
uh-huh 
so this is where the people have been kind of well 
i do n't a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma for a long time 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
and the drugs let them come back 
uh-huh 
but the drugs did n't work for long 
and they started having real bad side effects 
oh 
and this is about nineteen sixty four i believe or something like that 
and there still has n't been any you know new development in prescribed drugs that can help it 
um 
but yeah there you know 
it it was a big breakthrough 
but in time you know the all the side effects started showing 
well how bad were the side effects 
bad 
oh 
yeah 
yeah 
they was actually went back like they were you know 
oh 
um 
yeah 
all it was 
they was n't mild you know 
they was just bad side effects 
um 
but it i really enjoyed it though 
um 
you know 
well how about kindergarten cop 
oh yeah 
that 's strictly for entertainment 
that was just it was 
you know arnold schwarzenegger is getting to be uh a bit of a variety actor you know 
at first he was just a big muscle man 
yeah 
but he 's kind of branching out 
he sure is 
he is 
as a matter of fact um sylvester stallone 
is that his name 
uh-huh 
i really believe schwarzenegger is really going to be a varie- variety player more so than he is because he really played the part good 
you know he could be this rough tough guy and then you know this substitute teacher 
um 
it was really good 
well there was a movie out 
it 's been on cable 
i get cable 
and there 's this thing with uh danny de vito called twins 
oh i 've seen that 
yes 
i thought that was just great 
it is 
it is is n't it 
yes 
yes 
i even like some i mean some of the original stuff 
like i like the terminator 
at first you know it was kind of strange 
yeah 
but i still like watching him in the terminator and and some of the other things 
uh-huh 
um total recall last year i thought was really good last summer 
oh yeah 
guess it did n't last too long at the box office 
yeah 
but i thought it was pretty good 
yeah i did too 
i really did 
and 
i enjoy a lot of movies 
now as far as let 's say heavy violence i can n't handle 
it was um 
i 'm not into that you know 
i ju- 
like rambo and all that 
um 
i 
that 's just something i just do n't want to watch 
yeah 
yeah 
and i i have some 
one person at work i know gets really into those goofy horror flicks and i just keep telling her how can you do that 
oh 
and i told her when she had her her little girl 
i said now you better get out of the habit of watching those 
you should n't be watching them with your little girl 
and she says her little girl 's into it now 
oh my goodness 
and she wa- she watches these really gross things you know like the nightmare on elm street and the you know that kind of junk 
yes 
oh uh-huh 
yeah 
oh 
i do n't go for that at all 
i guess i 'm a little too scary for that 
i remember when i was real little i we all went to some kind of scary movie 
and it was like this h- big house had a basement 
and there was all these weird things going on in the basement you know 
and i was scared to death of our house had a basement for years 
oh uh-huh 
you know 
and i got a lot of really weird ideas from that goofy movie 
yes 
yes 
yes 
you know they tell you that kids can you know be impressed by all that stuff 
and it 's true 
it is 
it really is 
yes 
i i had a lot of things that i i 
nobody told me that it was all fake 
i was just sitting there watching it going oh jeez 
watching 
yeah 
oh i do n't want to go home 
yes 
yes 
oh goodness 
but i think a lot of kids it 's funny get the same kind of fears like there 's somebody under the bed 
yes 
oh 
where do we get that from 
yes 
i know uh 
i have two children 
i really try to watch what they watch 
i really do because my youngest one he watches something you might as well just plan on staying up all night because you know he 'll come in 
mama i think the ghost is in the house 
mama i hear it do n't you 
um how old are they 
they 're eight and ten 
so they 're you know they had n't really distinguished 
it 's just a movie you know i try to say 
it 's just a movie 
but no 
mama i 've seen it 
oh 
but i remember i was with a friend of mine had uh three kids 
and the little boy must have been oh maybe about ten 
and we rented charlotte 's web 
okay 
oh uh-huh 
and he just bawled at the end and just uh she 's not going to die 
oh 
oh 
and we were trying to say kenny it 's okay 
and he did n't want to listen to it 
oh 
he just was beside himself you know 
this is supposed to be a nice children 's movie charlotte 's web 
he just could n't stand it that charlotte was going to die at the end 
die 
oh 
oh 
it 's funny how your little minds work is n't it 
oh yeah 
she 's so nice 
no she can n't die 
oh 
oh it was jus- 
oh oh i guess that 's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars 
people like us you know 
oh 
oh goodness 
well well i 've enjoyed talking to you 
you too 
and maybe we 'll run across each other again 
yeah 
this is kind of neat 
i have n't ever initiated a call 
i 've just been called you know by the switchboard 
and uh well the first week i think a lot more people were doing it 
but i normally get a call like every other day 
do you 
well as far as 
we could not call in last week 
um 
you know from where i 'm at we could n't call in 
uh-huh 
they said it would be up friday the march the fifteenth before it was prepared 
so i missed several days 
because i was getting quite a few calls 
um 
how weird 
i do n't know 
and they they do have a variety of topics 
my first one was the toughest 
it was something like discuss pollution 
oh uh-huh 
oh 
it was discuss air pollution causes of it and cures 
yes 
i was going oh well 
oh 
oh well my husband sometimes you know he 'll receive a call 
and he 's at work 
uh-huh 
and if i you know if i know the topic i 'll go ahead and accept it as mine 
but the other day i got one about fishing 
and i thought oh my 
i do n't know a thing about fishing 
so i 'm not even going to try 
because when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good time 
believe me 
say well i know it takes a fishing pole and some bait and some water 
but i 'm yeah 
but i 'm really not for sure though 
well i 'll let you go 
and we 'll talk to you later 
alrighty 
bye-bye 
okay bye-bye 
here we go 
okay um 
have you ever been involved in any trials 
i sure was 
two years ago i spent some fourth of july to labor day on a jury that was uh a change of venue from columbus ohio for aggravated uh murder and kidnapping 
wow 
yeah 
it was quite a session that disrup- disrupted my whole summer of course five days a week 
sounds like it 
but it was an absolutely fascinating experience 
oh it sounds like it 
i have n't had any actual real life experience 
but uh my father-in-law 's been involved in uh several trials including uh a couple of murders 
and uh you know talking to other people who have been there 
and so i do n't have any real experience with trials 
but i do you know 
i i 've i took a little business law in in college 
and and i 've you know try to keep abreast of things 
uh-huh 
but uh hm 
i think that the uh trial by jury is is a great idea at it 's inception back two hundred years ago 
hm right now though it 's it 's so difficult because there 's so few courts to to get anything really done as you know 
you spent you know a whole summer on one trial 
uh-huh 
and it 's just that i think they 're just tying up the um whole judicial process 
um there 's a lot of things they could do to uh make things easier and uh you know like uh the suggestion that uh maybe the uh a judge should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the jury 
uh-huh 
well i think that there are many cases where uh the judges probably do make the decision rather than the jury 
our situation was somewhat different uh in view of the fact that uh we have n't we were a landmark case 
it was the first time in the state of ohio that um d n a testing was entered as evidence 
um-hum 
and they were being the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there could n't be a a mistrial of any kind 
uh-huh 
uh the uh uh the interesting thing was the tremendous selection of jury process uh that we experienced 
that took one full week uh to get forty three people qualified to sit on the jury 
and then it was a matter of the selection of uh twelve people after that 
actually it was fourteen because we had two alternates 
jeez 
and the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare if we were well if we were comfortable and uh things of that nature which made us feel good 
um-hum 
uh and we were sequestered 
but the makeup of the jury uh was truly a cross section of uh you might say a cross section of a country 
uh-huh 
there was one other person besides myself 
we were the only ones that had ever been to college 
hm one was a former student of mine a few years before who was out of work 
uh two others were ones who had never finished high school and were out looking for jobs yet 
gee 
um a couple of them were housewives who had never worked 
and then some are people who did work 
so we had quite a cross section of black white and women and men 
um-hum 
and uh it uh it was interesting just to listen to the rationale uh being proposed and the logic of some of the people uh 
it was also extremely difficult to stay awake sometimes because there was so many witnesses 
and we were not allowed to take any notes of any kind 
uh and i thought that that was a failing because uh from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to remember everything 
yeah 
and and yet the judge said well um if you 're taking notes you 're missing something 
and he was right there also 
yeah 
but uh uh certainly um i think it depends upon how the judge handles the case and if the criminal chooses to have a uh three panel judge uh a three judge panel 
i should say i think he can have that rather than trial by jury 
um-hum 
yes 
yes 
i agree 
uh would surprise me that uh 
when i was in texas i had the uh displeasure of getting a uh traffic ticket 
uh-huh 
and um i went to court 
and you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic ticket 
you 're kidding 
no 
and i thought my god talk about tying up things for for 
yes 
and money 
yes 
i mean that 's extremely expensive 
i mean the first thing you had to do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial 
i 'm like god this is ridiculous 
yeah 
yeah 
i do think that that uh i do think the jury system works 
but i 'd i also feel as you said that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup uh back uh in a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today 's standard of living and the the uh level of education of them of so many people now uh 
um-hum 
by the same token we had um uh some people who wanted to had vacations planned 
and one man in particular had reservations made plane tickets made everything 
and the judge called and had it all canceled so he could get his money back 
and then he was n't selected on the jury 
oh my god 
and then another young fellow had to meet with the judge and the prosecutor and the defense attorneys on three different occasions before he was finally excused from the jury because his wife was about to have twins 
and they had he had to go through all of that if in three days to get excused from that jury to be with his wife on the birth of the twins 
and uh you know some of it just seemed rather extreme 
yes 
i- i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that uh you know people would get a fair trial and not have to go through this process 
yes 
right 
i mean some things are just so cut and dry 
um in the in you know the the level of evidence that they come up with now 
i mean you know when you start thinking about well they 've got videotape and and audio tapes 
and they 've they 've got you know they 've got ways to nail people to the point where they they really should n't even be going to trial 
uh-huh 
right 
well i guess he 'd have to be careful whether with entrapment or some of those things 
yes 
but uh i do n't 
i assume you have seen on television recently as probably the whole country has the beating of the man in los angeles 
that was horrible 
is n't that terrible 
and uh you know and that certainly uh can not be said to be uh something that happens everywhere 
that it 
but the fact that it can happen that it probably does happen in many places it 's it 's horrendous 
and it 's just a stroke of luck that someone was able to get it on tape and then uh to listen to the tape recording uh at the police station of the whole conversation afterwards 
yeah 
yes 
i know 
i mean i only heard portions of that 
but it 's absolutely terrible 
yeah 
and you know if you beat a dog like that they 'll put you in jail you know 
absolutely 
well we just had a case uh like up at the end of last year where one police officer it was on a drug raid uh was trying to extra extricate um a confession or information from a drug dealer and did so by placing a hot a hot iron on his chest his bare chest burned him 
jeez 
they wound up paying him uh 
the officer of course was fired 
but they paid the defendant uh three hundred thousand dollars or something to drop the lawsuit 
and then last week someone shot and killed the former policeman 
uh 
so uh as 
some of those things uh are absolutely horrendous 
and we do need an all an overhaul 
and we just need more discipline country wide 
yes 
i- i believe that too 
it would 
then we 'd need it on that 
yeah 
well it 's been very nice talking with you 
well it 's been nice talking with you 
yes 
and uh good luck on on some other calls 
okay 
thank you 
you do the same 
uh-huh 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
yes 
i saw home alone with some friends just a couple days ago 
i wanted to see it uh because it was uh much recommended uh for months and months and months 
and it was a a genre that i was n't in the least bit interested in 
and i usually when i hear about a movie that 's supposed to be very good even if it 's in a genre i do n't like 
uh-huh 
i figure well i should go see it because if this is you know the best of the genre and i should know about it or something like that and i usually come away thinking no i really do n't like this show 
yeah 
right uh-huh 
yeah 
i uh i i i feel that way when movies are like blown up out of proportion you know 
yeah 
usually people tell you how good they are 
and you always you know end up with uh expectations too high or whatever 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
well the the problem i had with the movie was the problem i 've had with a lot of uh i guess hollywood movies which is you know it 's a formula movie 
uh-huh 
and they 're making the movie according to a certain formula that 's a good formula but they seem to fall short of of being really creative with a lot of things 
uh-huh 
i mean here 's the situation of this kid at home you know 
yeah 
uh-huh 
it 's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in and yeah he did some clever things 
right 
but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more i mean you know ba- basically stepping on things and yelling in pain and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used 
yeah 
yeah 
i was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie because that 's uh not really the way comedies are right now you know a lot of the comedies are more like jokes and you know gags and stuff like that there 's not as much slapstick anymore 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
well i guess it was a uh a very successful movie financially 
so we may say more slapstick 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that well that 's true 
it 's very cheap to make a slapstick movie 
yeah 
it is it is 
and i guess you do n't have to but you know if you look at oh 
have you ever seen any of the jacques teti teti movies 
excuse me 
eh the the french movies uh 
no 
not really 
the last movie i saw i guess uh was uh uh the one about the the french uh the frenchman that leaves and comes back and he 's someone different 
um he 's uh 
uh well it 's about a man uh that uh leaves his home and comes back to his wife 
and his wife 's all excited 
but the the guy that comes back is not her original husband 
but um gear um i 'm sure you 've heard of it 
teti it it um 
it was a very famous uh popular movie 
norman gray 
norman gear 
no 
i 'm not with you so far 
um oh shoot i 'm going to hit myself after i hang up 
i 'll remember the name 
but uh anyway that was a french movie it was um that was the last one i saw downtown 
uh-huh 
but i i live in dc well actually falls church virginia outside the city and uh so a lot of times they the the the international films downtown but uh so this uh french i guess are into the slapsti- 
ha 
ha uh-huh 
oh yeah 
i guess so they would like jerry lewis yeah 
they have they have a long 
yes they like jerry lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated ame- quote unquote sophisticated american record 
right 
company but they have this one guy jacques teti that does slapstick comedy 
and there 's something about it that 's so innovative you know 
he 'll just have trouble picking up his hat or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind or something 
but there 's something about it that just it is n't just slapstick 
there 's something about the human character in it and that 's what i find lacking in a lot of you know like home alone 
oh uh-huh 
there was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying to be tough 
right 
and they s had a lot of human character there 
but when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element became purely a caricature does does that make since to you 
um-hum 
right 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i see what you 're saying 
there is less character development rather just the the the funniness of the gag rather than and how it fits with the character right 
yeah 
yeah 
did you go with kids though 
did you go with kids 
excuse me 
did you take kids along 
no 
we went uh without the kids 
it 's was a a night out away from the children 
ah oh i would have liked to have a kid with me i think preferably someone seven or eight just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them especially to come home 
oh 
and you know if he did n't knock real loudly and clearly i would have gotten in trouble the next day 
i 'm sure 
oh uh-huh 
yeah 
that that 's true 
i i was thinking about that too 
i saw that um 
that 's why i watched another silly movie um um with my my cousin was uh uh the one about the um the turtles 
oh teenage mutant ninja turtles 
right yeah 
huh 
i saw that with my cousin just to see what you know what the kids are into and that is 
um-hum um-hum and your cousin 's a kid 
yeah 
he 's a little yeah 
uh-huh 
anyway um and that was just excessively violent 
i was worried it 's like golly 
yeah 
was n't it amazing 
if kids start imitating that they 'll knock each others blocks off 
yeah 
those yeah 
it was all bloodless and the good guys can get hit all day long and they have to shake it off they do n't they do n't you know get epileptic fits or anything from getting hit on the head yeah it it 's a little disturbing the violence in these films 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
yeah 
right 
part- it mean it 's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it 's comic book but on the other hand it makes it seem like 
uh-huh 
i i read an article one time talking about even the the quote unquote realistic movies do n't have very realistic effects of the violence 
the violence can seem very realistic 
but the aftermath is usually not there 
right 
if you see people who are severely injured it 's very very badly they lose control of body functions they thrash around 
uh-huh 
they scream you know uh 
it 's just a very very bad thing 
and they never present that 
even the movies that want to show violence as real they do n't really show you what happens with that real violence and i 'm not really sure how i feel about that 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
uh on the one hand i 'd like it to be a warning 
on the other hand i would n't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee now we want to see the aftermath all the time either 
yeah right 
uh-huh 
yeah 
it 's true 
but 
yeah 
t- teenage mutant ninja turtles is sort of the same way 
they i guess they figured i mean they know what they 're doing 
and they make the movies good enough i guess i 'm a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful and then they do n't and they but they could make them better you know 
yeah uh-huh 
uh-huh 
they could try to make 
i mean as far as i was concerned teenage mutant ninja turtles could have been a classic of world theater it could have been you know 
really 
it was it was innovative it 's a it 's completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways 
and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable cause the the story was stupid and and then things like that 
and uh they built up 
i remember feeling annoyed again i did n't have a kid with me and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation 
it was it was a classic greek you know it 's european mess going back three thousand years that they 're playing with um and he had to pa- 
uh-huh 
and he told them remember remember you united you can succeed individually you will fail and then there was a big climactic fight scene 
yeah 
right 
oh 
and they did n't remember that 
they did n't fight together 
they fought individually 
and they failed individually 
and then that was it 
then they had to have the master beat him and the master should according to the classic myth the sort of joseph campbell type myth the master should have died at the end because the the lesson was passed to the young generation 
right 
right 
and the older generation is not needed 
and is reborn to the younger generation 
and on and on and on and all this wonderful myth and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that i anyway as an as intellectual adult would appreciate 
uh-huh 
it would n't have hurt the movie to do that 
and it would have make it uh broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for i thought but i um i 'm i 'm clearly enough you know i 'm i 'm clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies 
uh-huh 
i realize that i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing 
right 
that 's true 
yeah 
there 's not too many that are uh that are good just on their you know that you that that you would n't want to change something 
and there 's always something that uh 
yeah 
yeah 
um-hum 
i i i i 'm very i 'm very critical 
i i i 'm actually originally from hollywood 
and then then then 
oh really uh-huh 
and my my father works in films 
and such 
and i tend to tend to be hypercritical of these things 
and then perhaps perhaps it 's unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies um and th- that 's what they 're for 
yeah 
right 
but i do n't i do n't remember them 
and i think it 's i think i can think of movies i have less fun during 
and then after the movie 's over i remember it so terribly well because it it had some some meaning to me or something 
uh-huh 
right 
exactly 
yeah 
there there there are a couple movies that hit home like that 
most of the ones i always remember are the the older ones i always like the musicals and uh those ones uh those stick in your head 
um-hum 
yeah 
yeah 
they leave 
the yeah 
they leave they leave some songs with you 
they leave i do n't know what it is but it just 
uh-huh 
i mean i do n't know if this is old fart talking here or something because i 'm not that old 
no 
it could be 
i look you know those old movies seemed to have had something that uh that was memorable somehow 
uh-huh 
i do n't know what it was 
um okay 
well i guess i got to get going 
okay 
well um thanks for hearing me ramp i guess 
got to go take care of the children 
all right 
nice talking with you 
yeah 
nice talking with you 
are you calling from texas by the way 
okay no 
i 'm in california 
oh okay 
the first person i 've talked to outside of texas 
so they 're paying the phone bill yeah 
there must be texas people as near as i can tell 
no 
yeah 
okay 
well thank you very much 
okay 
i 'm from the 
bye bye 
other coast all right 
bye bye 
uh being a former drug user 
whoa 
i uh i 'd i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it 
uh-huh 
uh because i know that uh in using drugs i was not a good employee 
uh-huh 
and so i can see from the company 's standpoint that there uh 
whenever you are an employee of the company you are using it 's assets 
and uh a- bu- you 're also under their liability under the workmen 's comp 
uh-huh 
uh on my job we had a lot of workmen 's comp cases 
and uh i work for a tire company modern tire 
where do you work 
oh 
and uh it 's also a retreading plant 
and that 's where most of our uh injuries occur 
uh-huh 
and what we do is we 'll have a drug test i- if an if a a boy or a man uh has an accident 
then he 's automatically uh given a drug test 
right 
do they do it like you know within hours of the accident 
or is it 
yes 
when he goes to the doctor the first time 
yeah 
and so that kind of uh 
i do n't know if it 's been a deterrent or not because we have uh just started using it oh for the past year or so 
uh-huh 
yeah 
now we 've let some people go uh that well it was found that drugs were used in their system 
now i do n't know how tec would handle it 
they have n't pursued it you know 
uh-huh 
uh if there 's some uh problem i know 
there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines 
and he went to a a separate drug testing firm 
yeah 
and they showed it negative 
huh 
so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know 
yeah 
yeah 
i think that 's probably true too 
that 's that 's that 's sort of scary 
uh-huh 
really 
and then i also had a friend who was uh just around some people that were smoking cocaine 
yeah 
and he tested positive on cocaine 
now then you always wonder well is he just saying that 
yeah 
yeah 
really 
really 
you know yeah 
yeah 
that 's that 's a bad situation 
i think that probably i think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that 
um-hum 
yeah 
i think they should 
uh-huh 
i 'm a ti employee 
and and and uh i 'm i 'm really gung ho for it 
uh-huh 
in fact i you know 
some of the places now um like ibm do n't allow even smoking you know in the in the plant 
uh-huh 
right 
we we have designated smoking areas 
yeah 
but um i work in sort of a building that 's that 's not really it well 
it 's on the campus of the ti facility 
but it 's a little bit you know separated 
we lease the building 
and it 's m- it 's a factory environment 
uh-huh 
and uh they they have designated smoking 
but it 's just wide open 
it 's not ventilated properly and i think that 's bad 
yeah 
but as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way i think it 's a it 's a definite i think it 's essential 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
because you 're endangering everybody 's lives if you 've if it 's something like that 
yeah 
in fact we 've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years 
uh-huh 
and uh i i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to came come up you know 
they never they never called me 
they never you know 
then finally the day we declared war was my time 
you 're kidding 
no 
and so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times i think 
and i told him he 's obviously in a high risk group 
the executives right 
right 
right 
and of course you know they they did specifically single them out when we started you know that they were going to do all them first 
the executives 
but uh-huh 
yeah 
would n't that be awful if you were if you were using and and oh lose your job and everything 
which i thought was interesting 
oh man 
yeah 
ooh yeah 
i can n't believe i 'd was so brazen before 
i 'm like i say i 'm a former drug user 
uh-huh 
but uh i i well uh i accepted christ as my lord and savior 
and so i do n't use drugs any more 
what kind of drugs did you use if you do n't mind 
uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines 
wow 
um yes 
uh-huh 
and all on the job too 
really 
you know it had gotten that bad 
well it 's really lucky that you got away from that 
really 
cause that 's really downward spiral 
it 's it 's 
life is so much more enjoyable 
uh-huh 
and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's that 's it 
i mean you know there 's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing 
yeah 
just life in general 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
yeah 
well i 'm well i 'm definitely for it 
yeah 
plus you know you you want to think that that you 're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share but that are not endangering your life 
that 's right 
in some cases like uh my husband uh several years back worked for motorola 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and they had you know 
i mean it was a chemical handling type 
oh goodness 
yeah 
i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know 
yeah 
like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing 
yeah 
and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals 
oh my gosh 
you know that 's really that 's really frightening 
yeah 
so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know on on a on a greater frequency than than maybe just you know the paper pushers like like i am 
uh-huh 
right 
well i would think they would be 
well you well you 'd think so 
but uh 
but they were n't 
i do n't know if they do it -til yet 
is n't that awful 
because when he was at 
course now it 's been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at ti 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
i forgot what 
i guess it was like eighty four eighty five something like that 
yeah 
and they at that time they had no testing whatsoever 
huh 
so that 's scary 
yeah 
that 's reminds me of uh 
i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time 
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living 
and she said oh he 's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff 
oh lord 
oh 
and i just you know went oh where 
yeah yeah 
should we move 
let me move as far away as possible 
ooh 
yeah 
that 's awful 
but i 'm proud though that that um you know i grew up in the sixties 
and back then it was popular you know 
uh-huh 
yeah 
but people have really wisened you know become wise about drugs and they really have a good campaign for the young people you know 
yeah 
uh-huh 
they know it 's not smart 
so so i guess it was just a generational thing 
yeah 
yeah 
peer group is the other way now instead of 
um-hum that 's right 
and that 's good 
uh-huh 
that 's 
that 's the best way to stop it 
yeah 
that it really is 
yeah 
well i think we did it 
okay 
it 's good talking to you 
well i enjoyed talking- talking to you cathy bye-bye 
yeah 
bye-bye 
well i was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that i 've done 
uh-huh 
and the last time that um we tackled it i did the kitchen 
and i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark 
it was called a sassafras 
it was kind of an orangish brown 
okay 
it was not real pretty 
yeah 
anyway so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color 
uh-huh 
i see 
i tried to cover it with white 
and it was quite a a feat getting that dark color covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets 
and know if i look underneath my cabinets i 'm not satisfied with the jobs i i did on it because there 're splotches 
yeah 
but i 'm glad it 's done because it 's brighter 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's for sure 
well we uh 
i just got married about six months ago 
and we bought a house at the same time 
so we 're 
i 'm sitting here in my forty year old house 
and we 're about halfway through the painting process 
oh lord 
so uh the only uh 
i guess the the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color 
we ended up with our 
our living and dining room are now uh kind of a a light peach color with uh 
and it 's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff 
so we 've got the trim in kind of uh kind of an off-white 
and this is really the first uh interior painting project that i 've attacked 
and it 's it 's been uh it 's been something else to say the least 
we we had the same type of situation 
uh the walls were uh uh 
well they were n't 
the color difference was n't so bad 
but uh there was semigloss underneath and we put a flat over the top 
uh-huh 
and everywhere you 'd miss there 'd be this little bright spot you could see 
it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint 
oh yeah 
every time the sun would come up in the morning i 'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can 
but uh we 've learned 
we 're we uh we worked we 've worked our way back into the hallway 
and and we 're in the middle of the bathroom now 
but uh it 's it 's been quite an adventure 
the other the other thing that makes it uh a little more difficult we 've got all hardwood floors 
and uh we we 've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth toothbrush and what not cleaning up 
so what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it 's dried 
well it 's it 's not too bad 
it it uh the floors are finished with a polyurethane and it 's really not to bad to get off 
uh-huh 
it it 
we 're just using latex 
and it 's not too bad to get it off once it 's dried even 
it it it uh comes off with like a a mild abrasive pad like a scotchbrite pad or something like that and wa- and soap and water 
so we got pretty lucky on that 
and it 's not scratching your floor because it 's so thick 
no 
not really 
oh that 's pretty good 
but 
we painted every room in this house some of them like two three times 
we have two children 
okay 
yeah 
and they just they ruin 
it 's just terrible what they do 
yeah 
and then i have been coloring my hair 
and i 'm real haphazard when i do it 
so i 've got dye on my bathroom door 
oh gosh 
and i have n't figured out how to get that off 
i guess i 'll have to take that door down and really get it good 
yeah 
yeah 
probably so 
and then we have a two story 
okay 
we did the outside of it one summer 
yeah 
that was horrendous 
i mean i i could n't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder 
i could get up on the roof and do that 
yeah 
but i dread that the next time 
yeah 
i 
we uh our house was painted as part of the purchase contract so we did n't have to mess with that this time 
but i 've i i grew up on a farm 
so i i 've i 've messed with outdoor painting a little bit uh 
but most of that it was done with a sprayer and uh up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that 
so it took a lot of the hassle out 
and then they 're we 're not you know you 're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a granary or something like that as you would be with your own house 
uh-huh 
no 
i would n't think so 
have you guys tackled your ceilings yet 
uh a little bit 
yeah 
yeah 
oh we got to do that this summer 
we 're dreading it 
yeah 
it 's like they 're dark 
yeah 
everything else is white 
oh gosh 
yeah 
just just the opposite of what everybody 's uh working towards now 
now have you thought about this that wherever you buy your paint you need to make sure that that store 's not likely to go out of business 
yeah 
yeah 
absolutely 
yeah 
we uh we stocked up the first time around 
but we 've definitely got all the formulas on file 
and uh we 're they 'll be there for a while 
we 're we 're pretty comfortable with that 
but yeah it it 
i 'm i 'm real nervous every time i i open a new can 
i 'm wondering if i should n't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a in a wash tub or something somewhere because i 'm alway- i 'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match 
uh-huh 
but uh it 's gone pretty well 
it just it it takes it takes some time 
my problem is while i 'm not overly proud of it but i 'm a self-proclaimed proclaimed perfectionist 
and it it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that 
and i 'll find i 'll find something as i 'm going along something not related 
like like uh i 've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they they really did n't match 
they were a few of them were broken and things like that 
so i always pick up these little extra tasks as i 'm doing this 
and and the painting actually takes probably uh a fourth of the time 
and i i 'm always doing all this other stuff 
and my wife 's hollering at me and wondering what else i 've come home with from work this time to to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that 
so uh it it it it always it it it gets you to look at everything real hard when you you start putting a coat of paint on everything 
you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere 
oh but i still feel good the minute i put that paint on even if it has got a dent in it i do 
yeah 
yeah 
it sure makes a difference 
oh wha- what else can i tell you about painting 
oh i get it all in my hair too 
do you do that 
yeah 
spots in it 
yeah 
it 's it 's been uh 
we we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it 
and uh it was part you know 
part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older house it just 
it really had n't been taken care of very well 
it it was actually it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that 
so we uh we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it 
but uh there just is n't enough time 
i i 've i find myself going to work knowing that that there 's a job about half done at home 
and i really 
if i would if i 'd just stay home and finish it i 'd feel a lot better 
but uh i 'm i 'm starting to learn that there 's always something else 
so that you could once you get done you can always start over 
and and you can make up all kinds of excuses 
so uh 
are you having to repair the walls at all 
uh not a whole lot 
it 
they 're they 're in pretty good condition um as as far as uh major repairs 
you know lo- a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that 
but uh the only the most major things have been uh oh i guess i- i moved a couple of outlets and or uh switches i should say 
they um for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway 
and uh yeah 
um that 's smart 
and i i did n't like that very well 
so i i moved that 
but uh most of it most of it 's in pretty good shape 
so where do you live 
uh live in dallas 
ca- i 'm in garland 
okay 
okay 
could you try to call this weekend 
uh 
to that switchboard 
did you keep getting that it was down 
no 
no 
i have n't 
uh i had n't tried 
you did n't 
in fact we were we were planting flowers this weekend 
so uh i was pretty tied up 
but 
yeah 
well i 've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything 
uh-huh 
i do n't know 
i can n't think of anything else to say about painting 
no 
that uh 
it hurts your back 
and it hurts your arm 
that 's yeah 
you know it 
i get a so- i get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that but uh no 
yeah 
that pretty much covers my experiences 
but you 're glad you 're doing it right 
oh yeah 
most definitely 
it it just it makes such a difference 
like i like i say th- the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much 
uh i you know i i do n't want to put a price on it 
but i just feel like we 're every every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house 
you know ev- every time i do something a aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home 
and you know o- the walls are clean 
and they match and all those kinds of things 
uh-huh 
do you have one of those straight edge things to put underneath when you 're doing the baseboards 
yeah 
yeah 
we do 
it uh it sometimes works 
and it sometimes does n't 
it 's i uh 
when i start doing trim i i 've gotten to where i i tend to freehand it because there there 's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it it 's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore 
and uh 
on your baseboards 
yeah 
yeah 
they 
you do n't have any carpet down in your house 
no 
there 's no carpet in the house right now 
see we 've got carpet 
and i have n't figured out how you 're supposed to paint it on down so that you wo n't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet 
um -kay 
because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it 
well you know um 
you can n't hold it there until it 's dried 
yeah 
i i 've i 've seen uh 
they 're they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths 
and you can uh you can tape them together and and and put 
okay okay 
what what is 
do you have a favorite recipe 
um yeah 
that 's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe 
well it says why would you what you would have for a dinner party 
um this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin 
oh 
okay 
maybe maybe we 're all set 
okay 
we 'll talk for five minutes 
they interrupt at the end 
um yeah 
it says what you would have for a dinner party 
i just happen to plan one out for saturday 
i 'll tell you what i 'm going to have um i can find it 
oh that 's wonderful 
okay 
well i have this new fondue pot 
and i was going to do basic cheese fondue 
and i have two different kinds of breads and some ham 
and i was going to try something weird which you know 
when you have fish au gratin 
i was going to make some uh like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue 
i do n't know if it will come out 
that 's 
what kind of fondue the cheese dip or 
yeah 
the cheese fondue i make 
some people like swiss um 
i prefer cheddar 
and i 'll mix 
i wo n't make i wo n't have a sharp cheddar because for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar 
right 
yeah 
and then i was going to make other things like potato skins 
oh that sounds good 
it see you do n't necessarily have to dip this stuff 
and um i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a a vegetable 
that 's always a good thing 
vegetable trays always go over so well because i think people get tired of eating junk 
i mean i think they like to have healthy stuff too 
you know it 's 
oh yeah 
it 's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party 
oh definitely 
i think better even than than other kinds of food 
uh yeah 
instead of something greasy or 
right 
exactly 
yeah 
uh uh no um my uh girlfriend 's do catering 
and they always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray 
i think they try and suggest it 
um-hum 
what i 've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make uh food kebabs 
you take little toothpicks and cut up uh pineapple and strawberry even banana if you can do it just before you leave 
oh 
yes 
right 
it stays nice and fresh 
right 
that 's true 
or even have you ever seen where they they 'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat 
yeah 
yeah 
i like those 
i beat yep 
um they they made a couple of those uh 
they made one for my uh bridal shower 
and i was pretty pleased 
i never made one for myself though 
but they look easy enough to make 
it 's not 
oh i think it would it would be a lot of work 
but um you know because it 's you know 
yeah 
you have to cut each thing or you know use the melon baler and stuff 
but but i think they 're really neat 
and you know i think they 're worth the time because they 
yeah 
you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done 
oh yeah 
then you 've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
um something i do is a fruit 
is i 'll get um make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them 
yeah 
i have two nieces 
and they they come over to my house they go melt some chocolate chips 
go buy me some strawberries 
is that is that good 
you know i 've seen that so many times strawberries dipped in chocolate 
but i 've never tried it 
are they really good 
yeah 
they 're you know if you get a sweet strawberry they 're much better 
but if you get a sour strawberry 
oh i bet it does n't mix well does it 
huh yeah 
no 
they um the strawberries are coming in season now from 
they 're they 're coming up from florida of course 
i live in vermont 
so but they 're really reasonably priced 
they 're coming up from florida 
so 
oh well that 's good 
because i know they 've been really expensive lately because they were n't in season 
yeah 
of course they had to be be uh grown in greenhouses and stuff and in 
yeah 
i think the uh actually i think they get um some of them from south america 
oh is that right 
yep 
they 
a lot of um oh of uh winter produce comes from south america 
oh i 
of course their seasons are switched 
guess i did n't really uh-huh 
right 
so um do you want to discuss your recipe 
well 
i have a recipe if you want 
okay 
sure su- 
um it filled 
a lot of people try to stay away from this 
but i make my own homemade pudding just because i do n't like box pudding 
is that right 
i 've never heard of that 
yeah 
it and it if you if you um well 
first of all i star- take about a quarter and a half of milk 
and i put it in a two quart saucepan 
and you put it on a really low heat 
uh-huh 
and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning 
i mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot 
uh-huh 
i do n't let that worry me 
and i get the milk lukewarm 
and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it 
and i have this thing 
it 's called the slender blender 
it it makes the uh it makes uh a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough 
it 's uh i do n't know 
they 're called moogoo leaves or something 
they 're 
i think i know what you 're talk- 
is it like a hand held 
yeah 
they 're real neat 
thi- 
yeah 
okay 
i think they 're real reasonably priced 
some of them they used to be a hundred dollars 
and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert 
but i did n't get that one 
i got the black and decker kind 
but uh it 's real handy because it does n't have a cord 
and you beat this cornstarch right into the mil- the milk you know 
and it does an excellent job 
or just hand beat it 
i guess you could use a hand mixer 
but i do n't think it pure i do n't think it gets it good enough 
uh-huh 
and then before the milk gets too hot um i add two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good and then about a half a cup of sugar 
and i let it pretty much 
i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds 
and it 's it starts thickening 
when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little i do n't know 
it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch 
oh huh huh 
and you just keep beating it in 
and it 's the 
the trick is is to have this blender 
so if you were 
you 'd have to probably almost go out 
and someone who 's just going to make it first time it 's 
you 'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders 
and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate 
or after it 's thickened i cook it for a good once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good seven minutes seven to ten minutes 
uh-huh 
and then you can make chocolate 
or you can take it off and when it cools a little they 
you put um really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter 
and that makes french vanilla um custard 
yeah 
oh wow 
that is really interesting 
are you saying to use like um for chocolate like unsweetened 
a chocolate powder 
unsweetened 
yeah 
that cocoa yeah the unsweetened 
it comes in like a real dark can 
yeah 
our mothers used to use it 
and then 
right i have some 
yeah 
we all used to 
i just want 
yeah 
it 's the unsweetened kind 
it 's not like nestle quik 
right 
okay 
i suppose you could use that 
i- 
cooking chocolate 
yeah 
but um 
that 's really interesting 
i 've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that 's really neat 
i- well i used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell 
and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell 
and it was like red 
and i 'm like oh 
this is kind of groedy 
well how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own 
um no actually i found it in one of my mother 's um homemade cookbooks 
i mean something she had collected out of woman 's day or something 
is that right 
oh neat 
so 
that is just really neat 
because i 
i think you could n't make it with a hand whisk or or a regular beater 
but um 
it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good 
yeah 
but i still think a beater would do it good enough um 
the trick is to get the cornstarch 
uh-huh 
um yeah 
right in the in the lukewarm milk 
sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl 
and i would put it in the sink 
and i 'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good 
it seems to be better than putting the the cornstarch into the liquid 
it once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top 
so you put the milk in the cornstarch 
yeah 
and i 'll do this uh 
sometimes i 'll put my after i pour that into my back into my saucepan 
i 'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg 
so 
and then put that back in the saucepan 
yep 
and then you know if if y- you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more 
huh that 's 
because by the vanilla does n't seem to thicken as well as the 
sometimes the cocoa is 
like my husband really likes it thick 
he says i can stick the spoon right in this 
because i 'm always worrying it wo n't firm up because it when you take it out of the saucepan it 's like boy i hope this thickens a little more because it 's not like real package thick you know 
when you cook a package it 's it 's a little less 
uh-huh 
but i put it in a nice glass bowl 
and um some people do n't like that that film on the pudding 
so you can put uh saran wrap over the top 
uh-huh 
and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the saran wrap 
so when you pull the saran wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the saran wrap 
and i might put it back on 
but um 
do you do you put it in the refrigerator then 
or you 
yeah 
after well when it starts steaming a lot uh i definitely yeah put it in the refrigerator 
uh-huh 
but um i 
my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you 're going to make it work too hard 
right 
that 's true 
i knew that 
that 's 
yeah 
yeah 
so that 's why i do that 
yeah 
so well i do n't know 
that 's my my great hard recipe 
oh go ahead 
i- i am glad to talk to an expert 
i always wanted to know who an expert was 
oh well i 'm not an expert 
i just had a little i 've i 've seen a little pollution in my time 
it 's uh 
the the the chemicals we were dealing with were uh a repellent 
and uh that was really quite dangerous 
i 'm not certain that that was that 's that 's really a pollution issue 
i think pollution issue is is uh is is the argument over over people catching uh things like uh respiratory disease 
uh uh well there there 's two things uh 
the one i 'm interested the most i guess myself uh would be the the freons i mean for air cond- 
the one i guess that 's the one i 'm most curious about is how they 're going to replace the freons in air-conditioning 
that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me 
and whether when they replace it you know they 're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad 
well the you know that that 's another arguable issue 
and i i 've seen the uh uh uh 
assuming you can buy into global warming i 
yeah 
yeah i uh was uh you know 
where they were all concerned about that 
but that that it seems to be 
well did you see carl sagan on sixty minutes on uh when he was talking about when if if the if the war started in in kuwait and they 'd set those uh all th- 
no 
i heard about it though 
uh it was it was it was interesting 
but uh i 'm just curious what he has to say now that they 've got them all lit 
was that before 
i did n't see it 
was that before they actually did that 
or it was w- 
yes 
and his argument was uh was that that you would see a uh a year with no summer which actually happened 
because of that you know 
it it ac- 
yes 
it actually happened 
uh it was a volcano erupted 
and it was high enough up 
but uh they had some people from the national meteorological center i think it was or which is the national anyway research people 
and they said that the uh that the pollution would not go high enough 
and it 's it 's going to be interesting to see if carl sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake 
right 
but th- th- th- the the the the general the opinion among among the uh meteorologists at uh 
i 'm uh member of the american meteorological society 
and 
are you d- 
you do n't work at ti 
yeah 
i do 
oh okay 
but i 'm uh i on- i do that in my 
where do you work in research 
or 
formalize no 
i 'm a planner a production planner 
oh okay 
but i- i i 'm in the active reserves as a weatherman 
so 
no okay 
yeah 
uh i- i keep up from time to time 
but what the the argument is that uh that uh maybe there is n't global warming 
and maybe there is 
but um if there is uh we probably could do something about it now 
yeah 
and if there is n't if there is n't and we do some the right things i think 
how do you feel about about all this smog and m- stuff on cars 
uh well i 'm kind of a car buff myself 
i was going to ask you another question 
but uh i- i 'll do that in a minute 
i- i think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage you know 
not not using 
well do you have an older car 
no 
no 
no 
i ha- i have been working on an older car 
but it to 
yeah 
really 
oh i 'm a car buff too 
we ought to work talk about that one day uh uh 
well i 'm restoring one 
i think you can use the you can use high you know the ninety two percent uh ninety two octane 
i do n't think you 'll have any trouble 
i 'm not having any problem 
it 's a seventy 
oh yeah 
yeah 
and uh 
no 
i- i think uh 
i uh work on my own cars 
and uh i do n't think that 's a problem 
i thought 
i 'm saying i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline 
but did you have another ques- 
you said you had another question 
uh oh ye- 
i- 
the same thing about the war uh or related to the war on 
i was watching cnn 
and i can not remember what station it was what 
did you see the advertisements uh when they talked about nuclear war what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere 
it is so scary that i hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster you know 
yeah 
did you see any of those uh 
i 
it was 
no 
i did n't see that that 
i know that the uh that 's 
it must have been channel thirteen 
i do n't recall although i thought it was on cnn 
oh i 
well that 
they talked nuclear winner 
and and i suppose that 's that 's the ultimate uh pollution problem 
it was a somewhat of a commercial because it c- i saw it regularly 
and it showed that 
and it was really devastating 
and it would uh 
well 
how much ash would fall 
and and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know 
well it 's interesting that the the chernobyl accident uh actually um 
because the circulation budget as high as it went um covered a a fairly remarkable amount 
they did some tracers 
and they 
i- i think it 's drawn in uh 
i think gets in there 
because i can n't think of the other trace 
but i saw a presentation on on that 
and they it went quite a long ways 
but i- i- i guess i can be a little sympathetic 
but you know there 's some argument that in in in the blue grass of kentucky that the smoky mountains that that 's the uh the pine trees giving off pollution 
and 
oh really 
yeah 
there there 's probably a lot of natural things uh 
but the but when you see when you get up in the morning in in dallas and and see all that haze from west texas is that is that pollution 
yeah 
uh it 
i guess it 's got to be really 
i do n't know 
i do n't know if it 's air pollution it 's uh it 's dust pollution 
whether it 's natural or not i do n't know 
well it 
that 's the thing is that i think i think dallas really does have a problem in this 
the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel burning fuel 
the problem is is it 's like los angeles 
people do n't people do n't want to use mass transit 
so 
yeah 
oh yeah 
well i live in arlington 
and there there there are no buses 
i mean there there is 
the only school bus the only buses you see are school buses 
so 
but who wants to who wants to um ride a bus 
well i know it it 's uh you know 
the car is 
we have this big romance with the car 
but uh i think people are would be interested if you had one i mean 
well my boss drives forty miles one way each day 
yeah 
and one of the guys that works with me drives forty five miles 
yeah 
and and they do n't think it 
well i guess they do think something of it 
but um not enough to you know 
you consider how much um 
but then you get into all these issues of of whether it it 's the types of pollution and what it 's doing to your lungs and are we going to die of of respiratory 
yeah 
so we all move out of the out of downtown 
so we get away from the the smog 
my my wife grew up in southern california 
and they moved out to the valley before los angeles uh wh- when the valley was clean 
yeah 
and now the valley is not 
and so people move out one more valley and 
well you said you were car buff uh 
i think that uh all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today 
yes 
yes 
because i think uh you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever 
yeah 
when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car 
but i think we all could in a family say have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife she could use one now if they had one you know because they she do n't even she does n't put fifty miles a day on the car 
well do 
you know general motors apparently has one that they 're they 're testing 
i think it 's no it 's alcohol vehicles that they 're testing 
no 
no 
you 're right 
i- i have seen them 
but uh they have a battery car 
almost but they suppose 
uh i went to the auto show this past week 
and they did not endorse now that i think of it 
and i was so interested in the auto show i did n't think to ask anybody 
there were no electric cars 
i was surprised 
but now that you just mentioned that 
huh 
well the road and track was talking about that this apparently general motors has some uh 
they apparently think they 're close 
yeah 
i- i think uh there could be a lot of peo- i thi- people close 
this is really 
we 're were nine years away or less i guess from the next century and i think 
well th- there 's still a lot of research 
i was over in in the research lab a couple i guess it 's been about a month ago and saw this there have been research it was a little light that says solar solar powered research 
yeah 
they 've got a they 've got a area over in the se building too which is uh 
but it 's a solar uh 
it 's for uh they 
g- got some money from a power company 
and it 's probably more generating power for you know uh electricity a hundred and twenty volt or whatever 
yeah 
well do you work in that c building 
no 
i 'm actually in the south building 
but uh 
oh well i 'm at 
i was uh i 'm the facility 
so i 've been in all most of the buildings anyway 
oh well i 'm in i 'm in the c building 
been there for all my life 
oh yeah 
well the the solar area is right right around from the auditorium now 
and they 
they 've got several different uh areas where they 're called solar lab 
it 's right there on the first floor you ought to walk by there 
huh 
well that 's been a 
i know the focal plain array is they were taking space to for a long time 
yeah 
but the solar project you know ti 's been into it for years 
and i guess it 's just not uh economical yet because of the other fuels 
well the problem is that gas at a dollar a a gallon you know who wants to 
yeah 
i mean we want to not pollute 
but uh at a dollar a gallon uh it 's hard to beat the amount of energy you get from 
yeah 
i 've seen some 
i think then again i 'm surprised now i did n't think they 'd asked anybody when i was in the auto show 
there was nothing uh 
and there was no place for air pollution or companies or anyone there 
it was just pure automobiles 
well i thought i saw an ad for volkswagen that had an alcohol 
there 
they had one with spots on it and something 
hum 
i did n't go 
but i- wa- it was showing they 
i mean uh 
i did n't see 
an article 
did you go 
no 
i did n't 
oh 
i did n't go 
so i wish 
i- i was uh quite impressed with all the cars you know 
the engines are so much smaller now and everything 
and they 're they all have brand new engines even general motors uh 
very few only the caprice and them and the cadillac had eight uh the old v8s 
they 're all brand new engines 
uh of course they 're burning gasoline of course 
they 've done a lot 
now 
and uh whether you know 
that 's one way you know uh uh f- 
on air pollution i- i- i do n't know if the automobiles are are the biggest contributor or not really 
they 've got catalytic converters 
everyone seem to have gone to that whether they last uh and do a good job 
and now that they the inspection systems are analyzing that uh 
well what do you think if you 're in that you know if you 're concerned about that i mean if you 're you 're you 're knowledgeable on that 
well there 
well they uh 
it 's interesting though because my cars are older 
and so i did n't have to 
if you live in dallas county you have to have your have to have it checked 
and it 's great 
i had a friend with a fiero that uh they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of trouble getting that pinned 
and so apparently 
well i uh before i was married i used to play a lot of sports 
uh-huh 
and uh but when i got married and had children and everything it seems like i keep all my activity just chasing around fulfilling my obligations 
so i have n't done a lot of uh exercise on purpose 
uh-huh 
what about you 
well it 's funny 
this week 
yesterday i started exercising seriously 
oh really 
this weekend i cleaned out my closets 
and uh a couple years ago i too got married 
i have n't have any children yet 
but this weekend i cleaned out some closets 
and i found a bathing suit that i had bought 
uh-huh 
tried it on and decided i really did not like how it looked on me 
oh no 
that can be awful 
so yesterday i went to uh a spa 
i belong to a private spa and went in and and got with a trainer 
and uh he checked body fat content and we set up a program for me to work on 
uh-huh 
and i went back tonight also 
oh that 's good uh-huh 
so i 've been two nights in a row 
and i i 'm going to take it pretty seriously 
i 'm going to start going every night just you know even if i- i 
like tonight i only went for thirty minutes 
but i at least did something 
do you work out on 
like is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it 
last night i did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few like three different types of uh uh weight lifting for my legs and and my hips and then i did a hour of aerobics 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
and that was really tough 
oh i bet 
and i was sore this morning when i got up 
but then tonight i got into a a 
it 's sort of like an aerobics class but it 's only thirty minutes 
um-hum 
and it 's for your abdominals your thighs and your butt 
um-hum 
hum 
so and that was thirty minutes was definitely plenty 
so 
does n't sound like low impact 
no 
it was a lot of sweat 
but i 've been trying to eat correctly also 
well 
well that 's good 
so 
so are you moti- 
have you started exercising at home 
or 
well i like i am undisciplined in the sense that i can n't just go and do exercise 
but i like to um play tennis and play racquetball i- i like to get exercise when i 'm playing a game of some sort 
um-hum 
and so that 's always been the way that i have kept myself in uh the shape that i was satisfied with at least 
and uh then i have given that up 
but uh i would really like to start that again because i am now you know not in a position that i like myself 
uh-huh 
i do n't feel good 
and i get you know 
when you get out of shape and you do n't 
if 
you 're easily tired and so that has made me 
um-hum 
but i i 'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa and work out 
yeah 
i just 
if something like uh 
i mean i have so many chores and so many obligations every day for to add another obligation would make me feel stressed 
um-hum 
yeah 
um-hum 
and i would n't enjoy it 
but if i have something some team sport or some activity then it 's kind of like having fun playing 
yeah 
and then you then you get some of the um good exercise and some of the desired results 
but you you 're doing it for fun 
um-hum 
yeah 
but i really admire people who can go and work out and 
well i do n't you know 
a lot of people 
i have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it and she walks around talks to people 
um-hum 
and and i do n't really get into that 
naturally i 'm married so my husband goes a lot 
uh-huh 
and we 'll go and and just do what we want to do and then leave 
well that 's nice 
but yeah 
and swimming is a is a part that i i 'd like to get into as far as my you know 
just aerobic activity they say that swimming is real good 
um-hum 
so i 'd like to try that as well 
and that 's probably something that that you could do you know family included 
yes 
it is kind it is family 
and it 's fun 
um-hum 
it 's a fun thing 
and kids enjoy that and and all 
and also the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation you know like a sauna or you know uh hot jacuzzis or whatever they have that kind of is kind of makes it fun and stuff you know 
yeah 
right 
you can relax that way afterwards and things 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i agree 
but well i guess it 's getting late 
yeah 
and i should take off 
but uh i appreciate that 
that helped me helped motivate me 
okay 
think someone can do it 
yeah 
maybe i should start thinking about it again 
well try it 
or or maybe just exercise at home 
i bought a tape 
and i 'm going to try doing that 
well yeah 
i bought one 
i went to the 
i bought the low impact first 
i thought should n't out of the blue just jump in 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that 's me 
so but i have n't done it 
um-hum 
but i 'm going to try it 
well you have a good night 
thanks a lot 
we 'll see you 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
we 're rolling 
i uh 
what what would you what would has your experience lead you to advise uh if my child were thinking of going to the air force academy 
what would you say 
i 'd encourage it 
um-hum 
it 's a good general e- ed- education for a a bachelor 's degree 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and obviously and obviously it 's where they do n't have a any post graduate program there 
but you get a an excellent wide uh basis of topics 
you know you get a good broad education out of it 
um-hum 
you do n't they do n't graduate the best engineers or the best english majors but maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um 
how do you feel about 
it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college 
how does that uh 
how do you feel that is for someone at at that phase in their life 
well the for some people it 's good because they maybe they need a little discipline need a little reining in at that that stage in their life 
uh other people 
it uh it 's uh suffocating 
um-hum 
you know you kind of choke on it um it it depends on the person on the individual 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but uh the one factor i think more than anything else in this day and age that 's got to be a big factor in your decision 's just the the cost of how much you 're going to pay no matter where you go to school 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and if you 've been in for twelve years i 'm sure you 've you 've got a your share of student loans that uh you 're probably going to be paying off or have been 
or 
well i sort of 
one of the reasons it 's taken so long is i 've been working uh you know it 's sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff 
uh-huh 
so i 'm actually managing to do this with zero debt 
oh that 's good 
uh i could n't you you could n't do it otherwise 
oh yeah i mean i know people that graduated or that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges 
and they they 've got twenty thirty thousand dollar debts 
i mean you could have uh 
yeah 
i think if there 's any major piece of advice i 'd give is to find a way of getting an education that does n't incur that kind of debt 
yeah 
it 's not 
i mean i remember seeing an article one time about you know if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a a in an investment fund they 'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the job they 'd get after college 
exactly 
so it 's it 's really kind of crazy 
it 's it 's staggering when you think that just here in central new york is uh 
hamilton college is just a few miles south of you know maybe about twenty miles to the south from where i am and uh they 're looking for twenty two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now 
um-hum 
really 
a year 
huh 
at just a small 
i mean they they they are s- it is a select college 
yes 
yes 
i know 
i was actually i th- i was thinking of trying to get a job there 
i heard of it 
oh yeah 
but you 're talking incredible tuitions now 
um-hum 
i do n't know how many people actually pay the whole shot 
very few i would imagine 
yeah 
but uh i get 
i- i just could n't ima- 
i mean it 's more money than i make in a year 
so 
you know it you know 
me being one person with a above the median income for new york state you know 
yeah 
i 'm a s- i 'm a second lieutenant in the air force now 
and uh i 
um-hum 
e- even as a somebody making twice what i was making how could you put half of that into to your child 's education 
um-hum 
and then just when they make made make it to the college years it 's 
um-hum yeah 
yeah 
my god i can n't imagine 
well my my real feeling about about the purpose of undergraduate education is it 's really the time 
yes 
you do get an education you do learn some things 
but you eventually forget most of it 
yes 
but what you do n't forget is the growing up 
it 's really the period when people become adults 
i mean people who do n't go to college become adults in other ways 
but really 
it 's the entry into adulthood i think 
and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in as you become you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society 
and maybe the air force academy is appropriate 
as you said for someone who you know a more you know who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them 
i 'd or or it 's also a good environment 
it may be good for someone who already has self-discipline who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own 
yeah 
and want to develop that 
and that 
yeah 
the s- 
it 's the same 
um-hum 
it can benefit different people different ways 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but uh you know i- i agree with that because i see people that i know a again from high school that i still keep in touch with that did n't go to college 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and they do the same old things they did in high school and same patterns of behavior same uh same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with 
um-hum the same patterns of behavior you mean 
yeah 
yeah 
and it 's like it 's like frozen time you know 
exactly 
it 's kind i find it kind of sad 
i really do 
it is 
it really is that they have n't found anything anything better that um 
or their experiences have n't been broadened at all that you know 
um-hum 
its a it 's a tremendous thing when you sit in a in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions 
and you hear all these different sides of the story that you never thought of and uh that 's another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for different point differing points of view you know or different opinions 
yeah 
right 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems 
yeah 
exactly 
yeah 
yeah 
the the one thing i think that 's no good for anyone is these monster institutions 
these institutions of th- thirty thousand students and 
oh i 
i see some freshmen wandering around in there 
and they 're they 're just like you know someone from the country lost in the big city 
i mean they they 
yeah 
i do n't see them getting 
i mean when i was undergraduate i went to a relatively small school for my first two years 
and then i transferred to a very large school 
uh-huh 
and that worked out pretty well 
i went from a you know a second rate institution to a higher rate institution 
um-hum 
but the first couple of years it does n't matter to me what the quality of the education was 
i needed to make friends 
i needed to sort of learn the ropes 
you know there were things like that that mattered a lot more 
and i needed basic really simple education that you can get pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years 
right well your education 's a lot what you make of it too 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
exactly 
and if you 're alienated 
i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having such psychological problems that you think this is n't sinking in 
yeah 
well i i 've seen more graduates from mit 
and that 
uh-huh 
being 
i work in a in a labora- an air force laboratory 
and so we 've got a lot of uh mit graduates that are in there 
and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that i think i 've ever run into 
yeah 
yeah 
even even more so uh like military academy grads are a strange lot too 
i- i mean i have to ad- confess to that 
yeah 
it 's sort of a a a rare select environment 
yeah 
and they they have their own quirks and tolerances and you know certain things that do n't bother us at all that would drive other people nuts 
yeah 
and then certain things that 
ways things we do 
the way we do it that drive other people nuts that 
right 
right 
sure 
but these mit grads are off in their absolute own world 
it it 's a 
i- i have more re- i have a lot of respect for mit master 's and doctorate uh degrees 
yeah 
it 's a top rated institution 
and now i 
but but their undergrads are like 
i i 'm amazed at at that 's a lot of them even graduated 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but uh i do n't know 
well i i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school not realizing that the reputation for mit is because of the of the doctorate research and the professors who go there 
right 
right 
and you 're not going to see the professors you know you 're going to see some ta you know 
nope 
uh so they put they they want you know they want the best 
and they do n't think they think what the best is is reputation for for research 
the yeah 
and that 's a one standard 
but it 's not relevant to what they need 
no 
it 's interesting that you mention 
that i did n't think about that before when you were talking 
but the service academies have all all the faculty uh for the most part is is military with a few exchange instruct professors from other schools 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but uh having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there uh is investing in the air force 
and it 
right 
or the the military itself it 's the future officer corps 
and so i hear horr- horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors 
they could never get extra help 
um-hum 
for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day i had all my instructors home phone numbers and could call them 
um-hum 
um-hum 
you go to their office anytime 
i had some instructors that uh would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends when i was having trouble with something 
hm 
and 
yeah 
you wo n't get that at mit or berkeley or anything like that 
no 
no 
and that 
and you can and you know you you can n't blame the professors either because you look at their job description 
no 
you 'd see you know 
teaching is third down on the list of importance things 
and 
right 
right 
publish first 
and then 
yeah 
and and that 's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it 's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time 
right 
so i 'd say go to a go to a college that has teachers 
people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that 's their job 
yeah 
but oh well 
yeah 
it 's there 's a lot of factors that people do n't ever ever consider in in their selection of a college 
um-hum 
and uh i do n't know 
maybe i wonder if if they enter these conversations that people have been having um that 
well i really enjoy reading the newspaper 
we get the daily and dallas morning news 
and i try to look at it 
if i get busy i do n't get a chance to pick it up 
like this week i noticed several copies have been un- have n't been touched 
but 
well do you have time to read the paper in the morning 
uh well not in the morning 
but um if the 
well i have two s- children 
and if they uh go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i 'll you know maybe go outside and read the paper while they 're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something 
you know a lot a lot of people do n't take newspapers at all 
we we took the morning news for a while 
um-hum 
and then uh well we 've been taking the times herald for ages 
and then uh dog just ran off with my shoe that 's off the subject went outside picked it up and ran off 
anyway um and then we switched the morning news 
but we found we could n't read enough of it 
and by the time i got home and had time to to read some 
but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines 
well we i do n't take like time or newsweek or anything like that 
but i do like to watch um cnn 
i have several chores and things to do 
so it comes on at like the nine oclock pm 
and so i will turn that on while i 'm doing some work 
and i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it 
did did you did you hear what schwartzkopf had to say about uh pete arnett and uh the the news coverage 
well he did n't have too good of opinion of it 
no i mean yes 
i did hear that 
and so um i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you 're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor 
well any you know 
time magazine and even the news 
that sometimes that that 's why i like some diversity 
the idea that 
i we have time which which we we take from time to time 
and we 
the problem is they call up and make this deal you know 
and well we 're taking that 
uh-huh 
and and we also hit the garland garland daily news 
i guess it 's it comes out sporadically like twice a week or some- 
uh-huh 
but i think what 's interesting is that if you 're that there uh this as difficult as he is or as as much as they try they put some bias 
i had the chance to hear tracy rowlett speak to a group 
and it was interesting that they think that they 're basically impartial 
hum 
and that 
but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news 
he says you know we do n't control the news we just report it the way we the way it is 
uh-huh 
and 
well i would n't think th- i would really say that that 's not true because um it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates 
yes 
and so um news stations always tell the story from a certain angle 
and that 's why it 's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions 
you may never get the truth 
but you 'll have a variety to choose from 
yes 
and i- i thought that was particularly interesting in the the gulf war that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a a ploy 
um-hum 
which was um 
i- i find that fascinating that uh 
yeah 
i do too 
do you ever listen to the radio or any 
i listen to krld and uh klif the news talk radio 
um-hum 
and i actually listen to cnn radio 
do you know it was on radio now 
no 
i do n't 
it 's on eleven ninety 
hum i really um have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of even music 
and um 
well when i go to work i listen 
yeah 
my husband does 
and it 's how come he usually calls me sometimes and says oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if it 's something really interesting 
and and then i 'll know to to keep an eye out for it 
yeah 
but i 've got out of the habit of listening to the radio 
well with with your you know 
if you 're around the home though and and and can watch tv and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is 
and then they start repeating everything 
um-hum 
and and so it 's kind of a 
oh that 's what 's interesting is the cnn uh 
i do n't think i 'm trying to think if it 's much local 
i listen to a little of that 
and i listen to a little of ninety point one 
i i 'm i 'm inveterate switcher 
uh-huh 
that ninety eight point seven 
i 'm i 'm eclectic approach 
do you have a particular local channel that you watch 
well i watch channel five 
but that has to be 
that 's another bias 
on 
that has to do with the weather reporting 
i 'm not sure that 
actually i think channel eight is probably 
but i know dave fox 
he goes to our church 
so 
television um-hum um well i am we 're fairly new to the area 
and so we 're still shopping for a favorite channel 
well the channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago dave fox and tracy rowlett came together uh from oklahoma city 
um-hum 
and apparently channel eight was way down 
and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job 
and then they 've been some people move around 
and uh john chriswell is anyway the 
i- i do n't know 
do you do you do you seem to 
can you tell much difference between the local radio tv stations 
well i really think so 
i noticed on channel eight that there 's all of the um anchors are seem to be like white anglo saxon protestant type people 
and they all seem to be you know fairly similar 
and i kind of prefer a you know some females 
i do n't recall that they have any female anchors 
and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people 
i think that adds to the diversity 
i think that uh i like that 
um-hum 
uh there i know you know john wylie price 
i do n't know if you kept up 
but he 's been protesting 
yes 
i have 
and um i prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you 're more more likely to get 
that yeah 
and i think he has legitimate argument 
i mean you can uh 
i- i- i grew up in alabama 
and so i- i have some prejudices 
um-hum 
but i think that i think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station 
um-hum 
uh i 'm not sure i i 'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs 
but i think that uh in some cases the- there should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and and this kind of thing 
yeah 
and i think that dallas it turns out though from what i understand has quite good 
i occasionally go to saint louis 
um-hum 
and uh there for a few days and watch the news and and i think dallas really does have have quite good news 
i think channel eight is the number one uh abc affiliate in the us 
i think tracy rowlett was saying that he 
oh really 
course he pumping his own 
well we you know 
like all of the stations seem to be pretty good 
it 's just we have n't found one that we 've snuggled into 
where 'd you move from 
houston 
so we had a a favorite or i did have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news 
i guess because you get use to you like the anchors and you feel comfortable with them 
yeah 
and 
it is interesting though 
it becomes a little of personality 
in fact the the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me oh long time ago twenty years or so even longer than that twenty one twenty three years ago or so twenty four anyway long time ago 
um-hum 
and and shortly after i got we got here fourteen years ago 
and uh they had they had fired him uh because he was too 
anyway did n't he did n't have the personality and was n't drawing the crowds 
um-hum 
and that 's interesting 
is that 's that 's what the tv stations do 
they 're trying to get ratings 
that 's true 
and i think if we remember that that they 're out after the ratings 
their job 
that 's true 
so that really effects how they report the news 
and some well it 's like the the dale hansen on channel eight li- is a sometimes a little too cutesy 
but i wonder if we 're coming up on ten minutes 
with is he the sports 
have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes 
yes 
i guess it is time to close now so i can run go help put the kids to bed 
okay 
well good talking to you 
but 
good night 
i have yes it 's nice bye-bye 
i was trying to think about some of my favorite people that i liked in music 
and they 're none of them are recent right 
um-hum 
so i like gordon lightfoot 
do you know who he is 
yeah 
and the moody blues 
and i like to listen to piano music a whole lot 
and willie nelson 
uh-huh 
so you like a a variety 
yeah 
sort of easy listening because y- you like country 
but then 
but not all country 
i do n't like that when they start 
um 
i do n't know 
i just like willie nelson i guess because he 's such a character 
oh uh-huh 
yeah 
i- i like some of his songs though 
they 're they 're not so they 're not so sad country all the time 
they 're just kind of sweet sometimes 
yeah 
you know i mean they 're not th- the typical country where they 're just you know my wife left me my dog left me you know 
my truck is broken down 
yeah 
my truck 's broken down 
and my house just burned down you know 
yeah 
but 
and there there 's a guy 
have you ever heard of george winston 
he plays piano 
no 
i think he 's dead now 
but he plays wonderfully 
uh-huh 
i like that 
are d- you do you play the piano 
is 
or you just like it 
very badly 
i 've got a piano 
yeah 
my mother got a piano 
and uh vowed that someone in the family was going to learn 
so we all had to take lessons 
and i was the one that did the least poorly 
so she gave it to me 
and it 's sitting here mostly taking up space 
but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it 
it is real relaxing 
yeah 
it must be fun to be able to play it 
and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it 'd be that 'd be kind of fun i think 
yeah 
because i mean i play the flute 
and not many things you can play that 'll you know people will sit there and sing along to 
and you can n't sing along either 
so but um i like a lot uh 
i like classical music just because of the 
wh- when i i do n't play 
i like jazz music 
but 
oh so do i 
what 's that 
forgot about that 
what 's that 
i said so do i 
i forgot about jazz 
yeah 
i like a lot like 
i like uh th- the new age music like with um uh the 
um um i do n't know if you 've heard neurotic collection 
yes 
we 've got about five of those 
i love them 
yeah 
i love those too 
they 're just so relaxing 
uh-huh 
i 'd never heard them before until i went in a music store 
and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it and i just i heard a piece 
yeah 
and it was just so wonderful 
yeah 
and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it 
is n't that nice 
i mean it 's nice when you have a piece that that is so so peaceful that everybody likes you know 
yeah 
and uh i- i- it it you know it has pieces that are uplifting 
but it uh it 's mostly relaxing 
and you do n't uh because it does n't have words you know you do n't feel like there 's anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean 
or but uh 
i mean you can just sit 
you know those little booklets that come along with it and you can jus- see the things that they 're trying to show with music 
yeah 
yeah 
my my little boy has gotten so into it that 
he 's identified the the people that have written certain songs 
and he buys the the pieces that have that person you know on it 
yeah 
oh okay i see what you 're saying 
huh 
yeah 
i mean i do n't even know who did which ones 
but he does 
i i can n't identify them either 
i just like them 
i could n't i know which ones come next 
but i do n't even know their names 
most of them i do n't know their names of the song 
but i i can identify them 
but i like that 
and i like um course i- i like classical music 
yeah 
and uh 
were you in the band 
i was in the band 
yeah so and i was in like chamber music groups and stuff 
so was i 
so i 'm used to pieces 
i- a- and i played classical flute 
i did n't play play jazz flute or anything like that 
so i c- i can relate to it i suppose 
but uh and i like i 'm like you i like the older stuff too 
because i like chicago and i like i like um uh let me think who um 
yeah 
i like hebert um oh 
you do n't know hebert laws 
but hebert laws is a flute player 
he 's a jazz flute player 
and i like um uh chuck mangione 
do you know who chuck mangione is 
yeah 
yeah 
i like chuck mangione 
i 'm trying to think of all um uh 
what 's his name plays the trumpet 
um yeah 
i like the moody blues 
did you like them 
yeah 
i like moody blues 
i- i like mostly the older groups i think 
oh 
but we do have 
i like simply red 
we got simply red 
i thinking of all our cd 's that we have what i really like 
and uh i like breeze 
i like the group 
i think just because they all sort of sound they sound l- a lot like r- uh simply red 
if i 'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays that 's it 's easy in listening um 
so what type simply red 
i 've never heard of that 
is it just instrumental 
no 
it 's it 's got people singing 
but it 's it is instrumental 
but it 's it 's got people singing 
but it 's got a like a whole bunch of people singing 
yeah 
you know um how many people are in on 
he can n't hear me 
i- i do n't remember how many people 
but it 's it 's got me- men and women 
and it 's not it 's it 's nice 
i mean it 's pleasant you know music 
it 's not what 's it hurts your ears to hear it 
but it 's not as it 's not like uh chicago where it 's got that much instrument to it 
you know it does n't have like all the brass and everything 
yeah 
yeah 
well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road 
we 're going to go to commerce and see a friend 
and then i 'm going to go to sulphur springs 
oh you must live in this area 
yeah 
where are you 
we 're in sherman 
okay 
so we 're in garland 
oh okay 
you 're going to commerce 
yeah 
for east texas or something 
yeah 
yeah 
oh okay 
just because there 's a friend up there 
not because there 's much else 
oh okay 
well they 're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas 
that 's why i was just wondering 
for colleges 
yeah 
east texas is recruiting for you know their fall semester 
well they 're not c- 
and they 're they 've been doing a lot of that in the area 
they 're not going to recruit me anymore 
i 'm through 
no more for me 
no more huh 
wh- what do you do 
well right now i 'm just a homemaker 
but i 'm going to school uh for legal assistant 
and that 's why i know 
so and uh just nothing basically 
are you going to go to east texas for that 
no 
no 
i- 
uh no 
i do n't go to east texas 
uh i got a degree from twu 
but i 'm really interested in legal you know in the legal environment 
but i do n't want to be a lawyer 
so i said well i think i 'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant 
that 'd probably be pretty interesting 
i was summoned down to the courthouse last week 
they had summoned eight hundred people 
about four hundred showed up 
and it was for a murder trial 
so oh uh-huh 
this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose 
anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty three 
yeah 
and they had us fill out a long questionnaire 
we stayed till about one thirty 
and they 're going to call the ones that they 're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time 
and the trial wo n't take place until june 
yeah 
that 's how it works 
and they say it 's going to last about two to three weeks 
and this guy in front of me said i can n't believe i was summoned 
i was an investigator 
and i was tailing the woman that was killed 
well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that 's a lawyer 
and he said that this woman this socialite in plano had hired four guys to kill her husband 
and the one that 's accused was the one that actually did it 
and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh getting cocaine from his client and then selling it 
and he had skipped bail 
and they finally extradited him 
and he 's going to testify for the state against her so he 'll have his sentence reduced 
and this is the man that was in front of you 
yeah 
oh well they 'll weed him out 
th- the investigator 
yeah 
he he got off right away 
yeah 
and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he 'd told me that 
uh-huh 
so i figure that that will make me biased 
and i wo n't be chosen 
well not necessarily 
hopefully 
but there 's probably something else that might make you 
because you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for jur- the jury 
yeah 
you i mean pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know an- and know some of the different things about it 
but um th- they might weed you out some other way 
you know if you if you do n't believe like if this was a capital crime an- and you do n't believe in if you do n't believe in death penalty you 're not going to be picked at all 
the death penalty no 
so but 
i said that i could i could believe in it in certain instances but i would be i 'd find it hard to levy that against somebody 
yeah 
so see there there they would have a doubt about you th- you know 
you know 
uh-huh 
because if that 's what if that 's what the punishment is in that in that instance then you 're always going to say you know not gui- 
you- you 're not going to want to have them have that cri- uh that punishment 
so 
yeah 
but then when you 're uh when you 're picked 
see i was picked for another murder trial before oh gosh and it 's so hard because you know everybody is wanting to go on an- and get the sentence done 
uh-huh 
and if you 're trying to hold out you know there 's so much pressure on you 
and you 've got to come up with a decision 
well especially with something where you have to f- you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt 
you have to find whether they 're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
and it 's like do you really feel that sure about 
what do you think about um the way the criminal justice system handles trials 
well you know they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers but you know it 's pretty hard to try let 's say the man down the street that 's living on social security or somebody that 's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people like the juries that i 've served on are businessmen 
yeah 
uh-huh 
okay 
now they do n't understand that you know maybe he needed fifty dollars 
so he held up the seven eleven 
yeah 
okay 
they do n't understand that because they have fifty dollars all the time 
so you know i think that it a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket someone that you know 
you can n't really do it ethnically you know 
but you could do it you could probably get it a little closer 
yeah 
but then there 's another thing that i disagree with in texas is sometimes you have a jury of six and sometimes you have a jury of twelve 
yeah 
and i do n't know why they do that 
do you have any reason do you know of any reason why they do that 
well i think the six is called a grand jury 
and that 's mostly to decide whether or not the person 's actually going to stand trial or it 's whether they 're acquitted or whether they 're actually going to be accused of you know and held over for trial 
okay 
i see 
okay 
i do n't know much about the grand jury 
how do you feel about the 
in texas i noticed since i 've been here in twelve years that they they break up the the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial 
yeah 
i do n't know 
i- i think that uh i know that judges are n't supposed to be crooked 
however 
well we know there 's a few out there 
yeah 
it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it y- give it to one person you 're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong or for you know 
if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off at much easier than twelve people could 
um-hum 
yeah 
it 's 
yeah 
would be pretty hard 
well i do n't think you know i do n't think that if i was the criminal that i would like the judge passing sentence on me 
if the jury found me guilty then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be 
and i think it 's not only that it 's a waste of our money 
we have to have a trial for this person 
then two weeks down the road we have to sente- sentence excuse me set a sentencing date so now we 're back in court again 
um-hum 
and that 's more money spent 
it 's not so much that i that i have n't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges 
no 
what bothers me is that uh they really do n't mean anything 
someone could be sentenced to thirty five years 
and yet you know th- the parole system uh it 's going to let them out in in three years for good behavior 
and it 's not working either 
no 
it 's not 
it seems that we have more and more repeat offenders 
um-hum 
i know i do n't know how you all are there where you 're at 
but where we 're at now our jails are overcrowded 
we just built a brand new one two years ago 
oh i think they 're all overcrowded 
and it 's overcrowded 
they 've uh 
so now they start turning them loose 
i think i heard fort worth that uh they 've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowd- 
they 're not allowed to accept any new inmates 
now what are they supposed to do 
they turn them loose 
well no 
i mean they 're not allowed to accept any new inmates 
yeah 
so what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail you know 
well the way i- it seems the way it 's been working here 's 
there 
yeah 
go ahead 
it seems the way it 's been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence or five to life 
um-hum 
something that is working 
and i- i- i really like the system of house arrest where uh a someone 's wear someone wears a bracelet like a ankle bracelet that 's a monitor 
yeah 
they 
yeah 
and they they keep 
and they are not allowed 
i mean th- some of them are even allowed to work 
they can go to their regular job 
they come home 
they have to be home by such and such a time 
they 're instructed uh so that this this electronic monitor is turned on at at a certain time 
yeah 
and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts 
all right 
and uh they can put a they usually install a video monitor in the house 
and when the parole officer calls to check on them they 're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it so that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they 're supposed to be doing 
all right 
and that 's working rather well 
that 's a good system 
that allows people to actually continue to be productive members of society while they 're you know paying back for whatever crime they 've committed 
yeah 
it would allow 
th- yeah 
instead of being completely penned up 
and that way it would give you know 
the probation department and parole department they 've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in in lubbock 
oh yeah 
yeah 
and that would give you know 
at least they do n't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy or trying to see six or seven people 
um-hum 
i 've i 've really 
i could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what i think we ought to do about it 
but w- something that i really do n't understand is when someone goes to jail and they have a job in jail and they work that they should 
sometimes it 's pretty messed up is n't it 
um-hum 
i and this may sound cruel but i do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes 
i mean they 're in jail for crying out loud 
yeah 
what do they need cigarettes for 
well see 
and there 's another thing about the justice system that i do n't like 
and there 's a lot of people that tell me that that maybe my thoughts are wrong 
i came from california and when you 're in jail they take you out just like they do in alabama or anywhere else in what they call a chain gang 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and they clean the city parks 
oh i think that 's a wonderful idea 
and they clean the city streets 
but you know we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day 
and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner 
more than that 
and i know 
yeah 
more than that 
but i know families myself that have three and four children in lubbock that do n't make that much 
i know 
and they 're not you know they 're not doing anything to support themselves while they 're there 
the thing that the thing that gets me is that while we 're supporting them they 're working 
yeah 
when they get out of jail they get handed all that money 
yeah 
that really ticks me off 
i think that while they are in jail and they are working their wages should go like 
yeah 
i do n't know 
they could 
uh some percentage like eighty five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board figured on um a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year 
yeah 
well 
um-hum 
see now 
and when they get out they should have uh i do n't know you know some reasonable amount of money to start like a couple of thousand dollars 
i also believe in yeah 
but there should be a limit over which they that it all goes back to the state 
anything that they 've earned while they 're in prison should go back to the state except for that you know 
there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with 
yeah 
to help yeah but at least they would at least that way they would be helping pay for their own 
exactly 
absolutely 
and something else that i would and something else that i would like to see is is uh victim reimbursement you know because they you know like you say these guys are in jail 
that 's the part that i really think we need to change 
and they 're working 
they 're getting paid 
but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from or beat to death or has nothing you know 
has nothing 
right 
our our victims are victimized period 
and the law has no no uh regulations to deal with that 
absolutely 
they they know how to deal with the penal system 
and they know how to deal with the criminal 
but they do n't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens i guess have n't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect 
yeah 
but it 's 
but i sure do n't 
i- i strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself 
um-hum 
there that 
i think it works much better if it 's if it 's the actual jury 
yeah 
beca- well th- see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime 
um-hum 
the jury gets to see the whole trial as does the judge 
but you know if if they figure there 's maybe litigating circumstances or something like that whereas maybe the judge d- just does n't care 
you committed this crime 
so i 'm just going to throw the book at you 
uh-huh 
whereas the jury may have a little shall we say sympathy you know 
he did this 
but you know why did he do this 
yeah 
in some cases tha- i- it would work that way 
is there is there a basis for it 
in some cases it would work the other way 
yeah 
in some cases where the judge says okay i 'll give you you know two to three years 
and 
the jury would would slam them 
and and i think that that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time 
then yeah 
well they have a stronger debate too because there 's twelve people there 
they have to decide whether or not he 's guilty 
and then they can sit in th- at the same time and decide what his punishment would be 
uh-huh 
and you 'd have more than one person 's input on it 
yeah 
i think that 's probably a much fairer way 
and you know we 're supposed to be and i quote in a democratic society 
so you know if you can find me guilty then you ought to be able to pass sentence 
yeah 
and a lot of jurors not that i know of but you know a lot of jurors may just sit there and say yeah he 's guilty 
but i do n't have to deal with it from here you know 
so the judge takes care of all of that 
yeah 
it might be more it m- would be more work for the jury 
but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it 
yeah 
it would 
uh s- yeah 
serving on the jury would be definitely more respo- you 'd have to be a definitely more responsible person 
the thing that i- i do n't really like 
i- i do n't know if uh a lot of jury selection processes that i 've seen have been a 
uh books 
yes 
mainly i read the bible these days 
that 's very good 
i do too 
good that 's great to hear 
uh and christian literature 
uh-huh 
uh i 've kind of 
i used to read a lot of uh novels 
but it seems as though if you really want to set a t- side time to read the bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading 
uh-huh 
yeah 
it does 
it 
and i i been praying that god would put a desire to read the bible in my heart 
and he really has 
it 's getting to where a just really want to read it 
that 's good 
that 's good 
it it it 's uh it 's hard for me to find time also to read 
uh a lot of times i do just read magazines and stuff like that for you know because i do n't have a lot of time 
but when i do get to sit down and and read i like to read the bible 
and i like to read 
i read to my daughter a lot too 
do you 
and uh i like to read you know bi- 
i have bible storybooks so i like reading those to her 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and she really enjoys those 
so that 's good 
and it and it 's kind of short because we do n't woe do n't have a lot of time to to read 
uh-huh 
so it 's real enjoyable for both of us 
yeah 
right have you ever read any of frank e peretti 's 
frank e 
no 
i guess i have n't 
uh this present darkness and uh uh i forget the t- the other 
well he uh he 's also written a lot of children 
how old is your daughter 
five 
five 
okay 
he 's written some children 's books as well 
and they 're all spiritually uh oriented 
oh really 
yeah 
what 's his name again 
peretti 
uh frank e peretti 
frank e peretti 
p e r e t t i 
i have to look for those 
uh-huh 
yeah 
do 
because uh i love to read his his uh children 's books just 
just to read them 
well that 's good 
yeah 
oh they 're good 
they 're great 
that 's good 
and it 's uh like uh uh usually about a family of um archeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into like uh uh digging in old ruins and running across like uh the old gods 
uh-huh 
oh 
yeah 
oh that sounds pretty neat 
yeah 
it is 
it 's real exciting 
oh i 'll have to look for those 
and it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know 
right 
so 
well that 's neat 
well i i have a 
my daughter has precious moments collection and i like that because it 's a it 's real easy to uh follow for her 
uh-huh 
you know uh gosh if if i read straight out of the bible to her she 'd never understand any of it 
well it 's hard for me 
that 's right 
it is it is real hard to to follow and understand 
uh-huh 
and uh i 've got a bible that uh has a little bit of a uh a glossary in the back 
and it helps explain who people are 
that 's that 's about the hardest thing is who 's related to who 
i know it 
and and especially it 's hard to keep your interest in those begats 
yeah 
yes 
yes 
it sure is 
but but it is good reading 
and it 's good for us and and everything 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
i really do enjoy it 
but uh i also 
but then on the other extreme i like to read uh um i guess ho- i do n't know horror steven king type books 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i 've read a lot of his too 
the 
and i i like that 
that 's that 's good fun reading 
yeah 
can n't put them down 
no 
you can n't 
you really can n't 
they are good 
and ooh they just they 're just so suspenseful 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i really do enjoy his 
uh there 's another guy 
oh what can 
what is his name 
oh durn 
you would well 
you know when you 're recording you can n't re- remem- 
i know 
uh oh dean uh kratz or kranz 
or 
judith krantz 
y- 
who 
judith krantz 
i know her 
uh no 
it 's a guy 
oh okay 
and he he writes the same thing though 
it 's that real gruesome horror stories 
oh 
ooh 
yeah 
yeah that 's good 
yeah 
koontz 
uh eh his last name ends in a z i know that 
yeah 
oh i think i know who you 're talking about 
uh i 've seen 
i do n't think i can pronounce it either 
but 
yeah uh 
yeah 
i 'm in a book club 
and i think i 've seen his books in there 
uh-huh 
i 've never read any of his 
but they 're real 
i kind of got burnt out on steven king though 
it seems like it 's all the 
did you ever read the uh uh oh 
it 's one of his first books the stand 
yes 
that oh that long thing 
i know it 
and that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that i mean 
yeah 
they do kind of follow or are similar 
you know that 
uh-huh 
i love that book though 
i thought it was great 
yeah 
it really was 
and i loved the shining 
ooh yes 
that was that was my favorite 
oh those hedges when they started moving 
yeah 
yeah 
whenever they they made that into a movie i was thinking oh my gosh if they show that i 'll just die 
for some reason that scared me more than anything 
yeah 
yeah that is 
he just brings stuff alive you know 
yeah 
you could just visualize everything 
that 's 
and that was a pretty scary movie too 
yeah 
i think they did a pretty good job 
but they did n't follow it exactly 
yeah 
but they did give it you know do it justice 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
but uh but uh most of the time they do n't with when follow books very well when they make them into movies 
yeah 
that 's true 
i liked it as well 
yeah 
yeah uh 
that 's another big fat one 
i did too 
yeah 
yeah 
that was good 
i liked uh i also liked uh cujo 
did you read that one 
yeah 
and 
except it broke my heart 
yeah 
i 'm a dog lover 
me too 
and then uh night stand 
is that night 
no 
it was uh 
dead dead zone 
that 's one i liked 
what 
dead zone 
oh yeah 
that was a 
i 've read that one too 
that was a real good one 
he 's written a lot of books 
boy he just sits down eight hours a day just like any other job 
i know it 
right 
and then he has some under uh another name that he 's written 
that 's right 
that one about the gypsies or that hunger 
yeah 
or so- uh 
yeah 
uh i think his name was bachman 
he wrote under the name of bachman 
yeah 
richard bachman 
yeah 
he is really interesting 
yeah 
he 's so prolific 
yeah 
ooh i wish i could do that 
oh i know it 
and i have gone back 
and after i i graduated i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through and have found that i enjoy them quite a bit too uh 
uh-huh 
i do too 
i love old good old 
once you can get into the language 
you know the l- 
yeah 
uh but it 's like it 's english 
but it 's not the same english they speak today 
right 
so it 's kind of hard to keep you know at it 
but their worthwhile literature 
that 's true 
but i 
that 's that was one of my favorite subjects in school was uh literature 
yeah 
me too 
i used to love those old good good old books 
uh-huh 
i did n't mind doing that at all 
nathaniel hawthorne is pretty scary himself 
yeah 
yeah 
i liked uh oh 
gosh why can n't i think of their names 
uh shoot 
the one that wrote uh wuthering heights 
uh was n't that jane eyre 
no 
no 
that was another one 
he wrote jane eyre too 
yeah 
yeah 
uh well you know who i 'm talking about 
yeah 
yeah 
those are good old good old books and good old books and classics 
yeah 
uh-huh

that 's why i like to watch that masterpiece theatre on channel thirteen because they 'll take a classic and and uh televise it you know put it into a a viewing format more or less 
yeah 
right 
right 
a lot of people just do n't have time to read nowadays 
uh-huh 
i know it 's it 's really hard for me 
i work two jobs and uh have my daughter and teach sunday school and go to school myself 
do you 
so it 's it 's hard for me to sit down and read 
well i can imagine 
but when i do i just just love it 
yeah 
yeah

well i think we 've accomplished five minutes 
so 
i think we have too 
thank you very much

bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
so you watch l- david letterman 
yeah 
well see our favorite tv show 
i i i live in a dorm and our favorite tv show is cheers 
uh-huh 
oh really 
yeah 
that 's pretty awesome too 
i watch it every now and then 
okay 
that 's hilarious 
well we try 
it like here they show it like every day 
oh serious 
and then like on thursdays is the night where the new ones come on 
oh that 's cool 
but we watch it like every day 
but i like late night we do n't watch uh 
what we do is we stay up -til around one thirty 
uh-huh 
and then they show the twilight zone at one thirty 
and so we just stay and watch that 
twilight zone rules man 
the what 
twilight zone rules 
yeah 
that 's all 
i used i used to live in the house that the guy owned 
are you serious 
yeah 
it was really it was really oh well it was all full with uh shelves everywhere 
and we did n't have enough books to fill it up 
but but uh so what what do you like why do you like david letterman 
that 's psychedelic 
oh he just like totally sarcastic and hilarious 
and i do n't know 
i 'm a lot like him in a way 
so and he 's got curly hair 
so the 
and so do i 
so 
wait did you watch saturday night live 
what 
he 's got what 
curly hair 
and so do i 
so hey 
hey i got long hair 
w- 
wait 
cool 
how long is it 
uh i do n't know 
but people 
the other day i went into a bar 
and this guy asked me to dance 
all he saw was my hair 
and he goes do you want to dance 
i turn around and go what 
he goes do you want to dance 
i go no 
no 
he goes oh oh i 'm sorry 
i go yeah 
you better be 
i go you better be 
that 's hilarious 
so but okay so d- wait 
do you watch saturday night live yesterday 
no 
it 
with the uh 
who was on the music people 
was n't that fishbone 
yeah 
yeah 
i saw that 
it was awesome 
but i did n't see the rest of it 
no 
oh you missed wayne 's world 
are you serious 
wayne 's world was pretty cool 
they 're awesome 
so uh let 's see 
what else 
uh see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the tv because we do n't want to do anything like study or anything 
oh really 
yeah 
that sucks 
so all the all we do is turn 
like like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the tv set you know 
really 
uh kind of annoying 
but that 's cool 
what 
kind of annoying to like in front of tv like trying to do homework you know 
yeah 
trying to write an essay you start talking about you know like in living color or something 
i do n't know 
well i i like i i just i just bogused on all my homework 
so it really did n't matter 
cool 
yeah 
bs 
that 's the way to do it 
yeah 
i know 
and i did that all through college 
and it worked 
cool 
yeah 
works for me 
too so uh let 's see 
what else 
like the news we do n't watch because they 're boring 
no 
unless 
i watched through the war you know 
there 's only one 
yeah 
especially the war 
i mean it was like i have n't i seen this episode before you know 
i know 
i guess they think that people do n't watch tv 
but i mean if you watch it like five minutes then it repeats the same thing over and over and over 
yeah 
i know 
it 's like oh man 
and and in north c- 
see the the the thing is like here they just they just give you like local news okay 
yeah 
like a house burned down in this little town 
oh 
and were here 
and i go so what happened worldwide you know 
it 's like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they 're not going to tell you you know 
they 're going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard who 's a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know 
yeah 
so but uh let 's see 
what else 
oh we watch like for example uh 
okay 
do you watch star trek 
uh i have n't seen it in years 
but i used to 
okay 
well i used to hate star trek 
yeah 
i thought i thought 
like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it but then we started watching it 
uh-huh 
and and like the new ones are pretty cool because because they got like uh like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind 
really 
oh really 
that 's cool 
because what happened is like they have this hologram right where you walk in 
uh-huh 
and you can program 
and everything looks real 
and you can touch everything and stuff 
are you serious 
oh man 
but it 's only a program 
and it 's really great because sometimes it 's like the hologram makes up all these things 
and uh i mean sometimes sometimes it 's funny 
sometimes it 's not 
but uh you know it 's something to pass the time -til we do 
that 's cool 
kind of like 
and then and then we watch football 
pink floyd or something uh yeah 
basketball 's cool 
but football kind of after a while 
which basketball 
which basketball 
college or 
yeah 
i kind of like college better 
it 's more spirited 
well we got we got two teams of the acc going there 
oh yeah 
we got duke and north carolina 
cool 
but i mean the i mean there 's nothing to do 
like for example yesterday uh they go s- some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right 
uh-huh 
i hear no 
we 're just you know it 's like we just woke up 
we had a hangover and everything you know 
and so we just woke up 
and uh we 're watching tv 
and i go no 
today we 're just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf and bowling you know 
uh-huh golf 
yeah 
and everybody was like it was like oh god do you guys really watch that 
no 
you know i was 
like a whole golf tournament it 's 
like for example baseball 
i hate baseball 
i mean somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball 
oh me too 
and the actual play time that there is is five minutes 
uh-huh 
because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it 's hit 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
that 's true 
and that takes like you know five seconds for the whole play and that 's it 
yeah 
that 's true 
it i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know 
but i mean it 's it 's like that 
i mean it 's was it 's just 
but when i went home that 's all like they had on tv so i had to i watched entire games of baseball 
oh really 
and they 're going oh my god 
and tv in argentina 's really bad 
oh really 
so so why from argentina why 'd you come over here 
uh because um i wanted to go to school here 
oh that 's cool 
yeah 
how long did you live there 
they have better computer science up here than they than they do down there 
oh 
so and i also uh my father works for ibm 
uh-huh 
and we came up here 
we well we came to the united states in nineteen seventy six seventy seven and uh we lived here for about seven years 
uh-huh 
yeah 
then we moved back 
huh 
and so then i said i 'm going to move back up there to go to college 
that 's cool 
he goes okay 
so he goes but do it fast 
so i did my undergraduate in two years 
oh really 
awesome 
yeah 
so but it 's it 's just you know 
oh well we 've been talking for five minutes 
that 's cool 
that 's the only obligation we have 
groovy 
and uh well tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks 
yeah 
no doubt 
okay 
okay 
all right 
nice talking to you 
yeah 
you too 
bye-bye 
bye 
okay 
all right uh 
feelings on what caused the s and l crisis 
i guess i do n't have a real technical knowledge for what happened 
i gather that there where large numbers of situations where loan were made that appear to be a good loan but in a speculative since 
and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the reagan eight years uh more and more s and l simply began to take riskier and riskier loans 
and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued 
um-hum 
kind of like a domino 's effect 
right 
i- i do n't have a a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome uh scandal 
are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever 
no 
no 
uh i vaguely recall 
but i 've never gone and and done any study on it since the s and l thing 
that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the hoover years where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it 
and that that appeared to be corruption within the hoover administration 
i do n't have a real since of of like corruption that caused s and l all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour maybe 
no um-hum 
no 
i do n't think it was really corruption that caused it 
or within 
i think people just started you know no- not being as careful with the loans that they were making whenever y- you know whenever they gave them out 
uh-huh 
i think maybe they did n't check into them enough 
or maybe because everyone else was doing it they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
it it seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a 
get rich quick is is the wrong phrase 
but if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it 's sort of well no skin of my back 
i 'll move on to this other company 
um-hum 
or i- i just since that they did n't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and i do n't know whether that 's because they had other opportunities to which they could move you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they did n't were n't stuck to where they were 
and as the things begin to collapse 
they just moved on 
i 'm not sure 
or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they did n't they did n't care any more 
i i just i 'm rather puzzled about the whole thing 
um-hum 
i know well i 'm um i know a little bit about it 
but i do n't as much as i should know about it 
i 'm a finance major here at clarion 
it okay 
and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the savings and l made with a a hundred thousand dollars 
so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars 
and i think that 's kind of why they they were making the riskier loans 
because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it 
well they did n't they did n't have a since of risk 
no 
i do n't think so 
oh okay 
and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan 
and like some banks you know they 're limited to the types of loans that they 're allowed to make 
uh-huh 
and i think the s and l 's were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make 
okay 
and i think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i do n't think this would have happened 
well do you think we 
there 's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and nickels 
but do you think there 's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that that they really do understand how much money it is 
for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of the damage uh 
um-hum 
did is your sense that that we now understand how bad it is 
or is there more to be heard yet 
um i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it 
and it was n't making it was n't as good news as it was 
i think it 's still a- you know adding up 
and i think it will be for awhile 
so you do n't think necessarily they do n't have a complete grasp yet 
no 
of the problem or whether 
i do n't i do n't think they do 
i do n't think how i do n't think how they could find that big you know how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some s and l 's still open 
it uh-huh 
and it 's and it 's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this 
to be caught in the 
um-hum 
um-hum 
land slide do you think to possibly is that it 'll happen with the the regular banks 
i- i do n't know 
i thin- i think it would be harder 
but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it 
it seems that i recall reading for the last oh let 's say starting three years ago but not so much in the last year of bank risks of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like mexico venezuela uh and argentina based on oil loans 
um-hum 
and then the price of oil had had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky 
and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans 
i have this vague since that that could happen that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost 
oh yeah um 
in some of my classes now i was just rea- 
i think it was in venezuela 
i can n't remember what company it was 
but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back 
um-hum 
you know and they just they just wrote it right off 
i think i think we 've lost a lot of money 
and you know like we every never going to get it back 
it 's impossible to get it back 
and so you think that it 's just gone 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
because we- we 're you know we 're talking about some companies that have just like even gave up on getting it back they 're even trying any more 
okay 
they just totally wrote it off their book 
do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program 
like my since is that was there to try to protect small investors 
but it ended up protecting big investors which i do n't think is what it was meant to do 
hum 
so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exists for for these sorts of of problems 
um-hum 
um yeah 
i think is it necessary to have um the backing um 
it it 's just it 's just for you know safe purposes you know in case something would happen um 
yeah 
as long as there 's enough little companies we 're going to have to have something 
um so your since is that the that uh the the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money 
um-hum 
right 
and given that the s and l 's have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected 
um-hum 
and that is it 's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of of dollars being protected 
um-hum 
it it seems like um there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts uh 
it 's 
if if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred bi- billion dollars 
and we 're taking about monies way in access of that now 
so it 's obvious that we 've protected large accounts 
um-hum 
and perhaps multiple people in multiple s and l 's 
and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought 
yeah 
you know that the for 
i guess i 'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts 
but i feel likes it 's on an individual basis 
someone whose got accounts in thirty five different s and l 's or thirty or forty thousand dollars 
and they 're all protected by the government 
seems to me like they 've gotten around what was intended to be the issue there 
uh-huh 
i guess i do n't have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy user of any s and l 's 
um-hum 
and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt 
and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again 
um-hum i think it could happen 
because that means means i 'm not worried enough uh 
yeah 
it 's kind of thing where maybe we 'll survive 
and then i then it will happen again because we do n't pay attention to those kinds of things 
um-hum i think it 'll happen again 
but i think it 'll be a long time in the future before it does happen again 
because i think like the bank people and any kind of people like that are going to be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future 
but i think later on they 're going to start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans 
because i mean you 're going to have to take some risks 
and as long as they 're backed i think they 're still going to you know start taking on riskier loans 
and i think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until you know late you know in the future 
uh-huh 
well perhaps if there are regulatory um constraints put back in place it will protect that 
um-hum 
maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation uh 
do you are you on a regul- regular exercise program right now 
yes 
and i hate it 
how about you 
oh well i 'm kind of off and on 
off and on 
well i guess i 've been kind of off and on 
i 've um had some health problems that have led me to uh 
right now i 'm kind of off 
stay more on than off 
okay 
what type of exercise do you do 
uh i do walking on the treadmill 
and then i do low impact aerobics 
okay 
i guess you do n't enjoy that very much 
not not really 
you find that uh to be boring 
y- yeah 
and time consuming 
i mean it 's it 's not just the exercise that 's boring and time consuming 
it 's uh you know afterwards you know 
then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know 
yeah 
well i 'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring 
i know 
but i 
you go through this this is something you go through like every year 
yeah 
i have n't decided whether you 're whether i want to play yet or not 
i just bought myself a solo flex machine 
i do n't know if you 've seen those advertised on tv 
hum-um 
it 's one of those uh universal type machines exercise machine 
but i have n't really sat down and used it much yet 
so it 's collecting dust right now 
yeah 
a lot of things do that 
i have a neg- i had an exercise bike 
i used to jog somewhat 
i used to have one 
and finally got rid of it because i never used it 
but i do use my treadmill 
uh-huh 
well that 's good 
yeah 
my parents have a treadmill 
it 's 
when i go visit them uh i 'll get on that thing every now and then 
yeah 
it 's nice because when the weather 's bad you can n't you do n't have any excuse 
um-hum 
no i just got the bicycle out today 
and it was real nice outside 
had to get out to do something 
yeah 
i can n't ride a bike 
so 
i been sitting in here uh in the house all weekend with a cold 
so i thought i 'd better uh better get outside and do something and not waste the day 
oh 
yeah 
it 's too nice 
been too nice of a weekend 
but uh yeah 
i need to start jogging again 
i 've always found that to be uh uh really one of the best forms of exercise 
but it 's terribly boring 
and so i really do n't ever keep a a program up consistently 
uh you had any injuries from jogging 
no 
i never have 
well i do n't jog enough i think to develop any injuries 
i usually only go about a mile or two 
i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it 's very hard on your body a- and that you know you can end up getting hurt worse 
yeah 
it 's it 's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt 
um-hum 
supposed to be much better if you find uh grass or or uh dirt to jog on 
yeah 
that 's not quite so so easy 
have to have the right type of uh shoes too 
that 's very important 
yeah 
yeah 
i found that true especially for walking on toes or fronts 
but 
yeah 
i do n't have to buy jogging shoes all too often 
mine do n't get very much use 
well i guess mine breakdown about they say about every six months 
uh-huh 
ah i usually enjoy the exercise i do 
but uh like i said i 'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program 
so i 'll i 'll bicycle 
i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out and uh on a consistent basis every couple a days and ride a bike for awhile 
but then i 'll get tired of doing that an- maybe start jogging again and go out three or four nights a week 
but uh that gets old too in a very short order 
so yeah 
i 'm i 'm hoping that this uh solo flex will uh uh change things a little bit 
i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis 
yeah 
well do n't let it collect dust 
you least exercise while dusting it off 
yeah 
well 
so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this spring i can uh start some type of uh regular program 
yeah 
that that 'll be good 
i 've always found that that when you write things down and set goals it 's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going 
um-hum 
uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise 
and uh one of those involved a six week session on a universal machine lifting weights and uh working out like that 
oh 
and that was very helpful 
and we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently uh increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks 
um-hum 
i found that to be uh very helpful 
so are you going to do that 
uh i need to 
i have n't started yet 
but it 's a thought 
well that sounds like something good to do then 
sounds like something i should do 
yeah 
nice way to start off the spring 
get back in shape 
uh-huh how often do you uh uh go out each week on your walking 
well i do 
i switch every other day 
one day i walk 
and one day i do the aerobics 
okay 
how far about how far do you go walking 
well i 'm trying build up my tolerance now 
i jus- surgery um less than two months ago 
and right now i 'm just a little over about a mile and a half 
okay 
but i tr- try to workup to three miles 
yeah that 's good 
well they say that walking is just as good if not better than jogging 
yeah 
it 
it takes it 's ju- tha- it takes longer to get the same effect 
sure 
yeah 
but 
well if you keep up a a consistent pace just to keep the heart rate going uh 
my walkman broke 
yeah 
so i 'm upset 
now i just have to turn the stereo up real loud 
yeah 
but it 's a lot less stressful on the joints than jogging is 
yeah 
it is 
and it this has an you know 
my treadmill has an incline 
and you know you can get a really good workout on it 
um-hum do you go to an aerobics class 
or do you watch on tv 
no 
i- i just do it on tv 
okay 
i have a cassette 
which uh shows do you watch on tv 
um it 's j- a it 's a ta- 
i use tapes 
oh okay 
okay 
like a kathy smith workout 
ri- or richard simmons 
or jane fonda 
okay 
sweating to the oldies 
right 
i w- every every now and then i 'll watch uh espn 
i i get cable on tv 
uh-huh 
and they have uh a couple of shows called basic training 
and um what is the other one called 
there was one guy i used to watch on espn 
i do n't know if he 's still on it anymore or not 
i do n't i do n't know if i get espn or not 
uh-huh 
but um well yeah 
i used to watch o- watch one on the air 
but that was back 
bodies in motion that 's that 's the name of the one i was thinking of 
that was 
yeah 
with gil 
yeah 
yeah 
i watched that cause he was cute 
janklowicz yeah 
well he 's he 's he he he 's not bad 
and his assistants usually are n't either 
but uh 
they 're always in in in hawaii someplace on on the on the beach 
yeah 
yeah 
but then that was back when um you know the high impact and 
yeah 
well they they do low impact stuff now 
do they 
they 're on everyday 
are the- 
yeah 
ok- they 're so they 're still he 's still doing it then huh 
yeah 
every morning 
oh i 'll have to tune in 
it 's on espn uh 
at what time 
i can n't remember what time 
it 's uh -ell 
i can n't remember offhand what time 
i 'll have to check it check check it back up 
they 
then b- the thing is is everybody always looks so good on there show least on 
have that show on yeah 
every now and then 
some of the other ones not everybody has a picture perfect body 
um-hum 
well i found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on tv 
i have n't watched any other ones on tv um just on some of the tapes 
they 're on weekdays at eleven oclock everyday monday through friday case you 're interested in that 
so i 'll have to okay 
thanks 
i actually taped a few of the sessions that they had on there 
but uh i have n't done so much as uh watch the tape that i made 
now that 's a thought 
so i 'm kind of bad about that myself 
well that 's a thought 
i had n't thought about doing that 
well they 're going to beep us pretty soon 
okay 
well i sure enjoyed talking to you about uh exercise and fitness 
uh-huh nice talking to you 
okay 
thanks 
so all right 
talk to you later 
good night 
bye 
bye 
okay 
capital punishment 
oh i honestly do n't feel like it 's strict enough in my opinion 
in the way that it 's applied or that it 's applied at all 
uh-huh 
applied at all 
so i 
how do you feel that it should be applied 
well i ju- i just feel like there 's a lot of murderers and rapists and everything else just walking the streets you know 
and that that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced 
yes 
yes 
not getting paroled lets say in so many years 
yes 
i mean if your going to sentence somebody lets say twenty years let them stay twenty years 
that 's 
i agree with that completely 
i know we do n't have enough prisons 
but there has got to be some kind of punishment for these people 
there has 
that 's right 
because if they turn around they can get away they get away with it 
and they get away with it 
and they get away with it 
and then they do something worse and they get a slap on the wrist 
uh-huh 
they get thirty days in jail and they finally get up to where they kill somebody else 
yeah 
yeah 
and they go through fourteen appeals and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
that 's honestly right 
and it 's 
they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways you know 
well they certainly are living off our ex- at our expense 
but they sure are just because some innocent person can really 
i did n't 
it seems like really serve a rough time you know i 'm not saying innocent person 
yes 
let 's say someone wrote a hot check for instance 
you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like it 's a rough time for them and a murderer well go to prison oh 
um-hum 
he 's just there to serve his time and get back out on the street 
and and be paroled and and have served the sentence 
yes 
that 's what that 's what people face with that choice 
one thing i really hate is they do n't explain to the jurors in a in a trial on a capital murder trial or in cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to you know 
they 'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it 's you know that it 's going to you know 
uh-huh 
that should be life 
but instead in in 
given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they 'll give them ninety years in prison or something and then turn around in thirty years that you know 
and less they 're out 
uh-huh 
even if if they 're even in that long 
or they appeal 
and then they get an appeal that says it was you know an unjust amount of time it was an extraordinary long length or something 
time uh-huh 
yes 
i just i would just be 
i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole you know 
yeah 
i 'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent 
i think people know that nobody that it does n't you know 
i- it 's not a deterrent right now because it 's not really effective 
uh-huh 
there 's should be you know this for this crime this is the penalty 
you killed someone you know in cold blood or whatever 
um-hum 
yeah 
you get it back 
yeah 
this is what 's going to happen 
yeah 
and i mean it sounds horrible 
it 
i i hear myself saying this 
and but i do n't know what else to do with some of these people that are 
but it 's 
i- i know 
because they let them back out again 
and they do the same thing over and over again 
yeah same thing 
yes 
then they put them back in jail 
and they get out 
and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system 
yes 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and it 's like i said at our expense 
uh a lot of people really does n't think that much about it because it has n't happened to them which it has n't to me either you know 
yes 
thank goodness 
but still i- it could 
i know 
i you read about it in the paper every day somebody who 's done this or that something really horrible and they just get away with it 
yes 
uh-huh 
and nothing happens 
and as far as the other states i honestly do n't know what their capital punishment is 
you know i- i have n't kept up you know anything like that 
yeah 
i think i think texas is wha- texas the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty 
and i think i know california had it for a long time 
and then they um took it off the books 
they repealed it and people like charles manson and and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison and are now now that even though california has reinstated the death penalty for whatever various crimes 
uh-huh 
the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole 
some of them like manson who 's come up you know 
um-hum 
but 
it 's been denied fortunately 
but 
yes 
but still it came up though did n't it 
yeah 
i mean you know uh-huh 
well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of california revoked revoked the law in the early seventies 
and then they reinstated it later 
but the penalty did n't go back you know 
uh-huh 
it seems like a lot of times the law is is totally on the criminal side and and is n't protecting the rest of the people 
yes 
the victim is really seems like left out in the cold more or less does n't it 
um-hum 
in a lot of well especially in things you pick up the paper 
and you read you know you think oh my goodness uh-huh 
yeah 
and the the laws are all the rules 
some of the things that would make sense to to tell the jury that this this guy has a a prior criminal history you know where he 's raped ten women and then he gets up for this one trial 
and they do n't find anything out about the facts that he 's done this over and over and over again and so they say well this is you know 
uh-huh 
i- i do n't know if they say it 's the first time offense or whatever 
but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he 's not a habitual criminal 
or you know plead insanity 
yeah 
you know 
well 
and a lots of things 
to some extent if they would do something with some of those people 
but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too 
oh yes 
they plead insanity and then three years later they 're cured and let loose on society again 
i 
think ye- uh-huh 
yes 
i 
it just just does n't make sense 
i mean it 's a it 's a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out 
i 
i know in in the dallas metroplex area i do n't go out hardly if i do n't have to at night by myself and i- i certainly i i grew up in a smaller town in texas 
just uh-huh 
and it was n't that way when i was younger 
uh-huh 
well like i said i live in a small place you know 
we could go around 
and boy 
but uh even the small towns now though has really changed from when i was a kid 
but now i 'm raising children 
it ju- it really is 
yes 
ever 
you can n't even 
when i was a kid i would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time 
uh-huh 
and now i do n't let my kids out of the front yard that i can n't see them 
see them 
yep 
yeah 
it really is 
well we 're probably fixing to run out of time pretty soon 
um-hum 
but i 've enjoyed talking to you 
well good talking to you too 
bye 
bye okay 
bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
so what are your opinion on it 
well let me preface it 
i 'm a i was a staff officer in vietnam in sixty nine and seventy and i 'm in active reserve now 
um-hum 
so uh i 'm probably not going to have the opinion you think i would have 
um-hum 
um it 's 
it was an interesting in that i think that he gave the american people some uh uh a sense of the fact that that uh wars are really run by politicians 
um-hum 
uh i 
are you old enough to remember the war 
n- not much 
i 'm twenty eight 
so no 
i really do n't remember anything about it 
i guess i was about ten when it ended right 
yeah 
i was born in sixty two 
so when did it end 
uh well december seventy two was when uh we bombed north vietnam 
and and they released the prisoners in early seventy three so that that time frame 
yeah 
so i was ten 
and i do n't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in great detail 
i think the the significant thing is is 
today did did you uh did you see barbara walters interview with schwartzkopf 
no 
i did n't 
but i- i did read the book 
i ha- do have i have six years of college 
so i did read and study about the vietnam war though 
so i am pretty fa- you know 
i 'm more familiar with it than 
well they well what what 's your perspective on it 
mine 
i think uh i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that 
i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to you know just leave their freedoms there and to you know get rid of some of the atrocities that were going on 
i do n't i do n't know 
i do n't really 
i 'm tired of pacifist though 
see on the other hand i 'm a pac- 
i 'm really struggling with it 
i 'm a pacifist physical pacifist 
i 'm a christian 
and i believe that the real warfare is not with saddam hussein or the north vietnamese but it 's in spiritual kingdoms and that the real warfare is done you know in your prayer closet on your knees 
so in a way in a sense i 'm a pacifist 
but i 'm really not 
you know what i 'm saying 
yes 
i do n't think just lay back and not do anything 
i think lets go to war 
but let 's go to war praying 
and let 's go to war for that way so 
well well the difficulty i have is that uh are we our neighbor 's keepers 
um-hum 
and this is what i find particularly difficult in that uh if we see injustice 
and whether it 's in a uh you know chicago or uh or or dallas i- i think if we see it you know we see john wiley w- price hollering injustice i think that 's wrong 
um-hum 
now the question is is was there injustice in vietnam 
or was there injustice in iraq and kuwait 
um-hum 
um-hum 
the difficult i point is is to where do we step in 
and and i think that we that 's that 's the part i have difficulty 
yeah 
and the the other part is that the the when when your when your when you 're looking at vietnam and you say well is fifty eight thousand lives worth it 
and i do n't know that anything is worth fifty eight thousand lives 
um-hum 
still have a problem with uh you know 
i have n't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this 
but and i know other christians would disagree with me 
my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this 
but we do n't fight over it or anything 
but you know how can you know 
the bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you 
and it 's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind 
so it 's like how can you 
i do n't know for me 
i do n't know you know 
i can n't say that i agree with vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and and then shoot them 
well the other issue is is is how do you allow uh how how do you allow injustice 
you so 
just like the the policeman in in los angeles how could how could could you stand there and watch them beat that guy 
um-hum 
if your brother or your sister were being beaten by the authorities do we step in 
um-hum 
well in some cases we would 
and i- i think that 's what makes it so difficult 
yeah 
it is a difficult thing 
but then vengeance is mine sayeth the lord 
and i will pay 
so i think god ultimately in charge of what goes on 
in i know like mao tse chung in china he did all these terrible things 
and they were terrible 
and he 's going to be accountable for them 
and but if you look back you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads 
he tore down all the temples 
he he unified the chinese language 
it was impossible for missionaries to do accomplish anything in china because of all that 
and so even in north and south vietnam i bet you 'd see the same thing and that now he build roads 
so then he 'd open 
and then he dropped dead 
twenty five years premature he just dropped dead 
and so something good did come out of that in that now you see what i mean it 's like now 
but yeah 
but but the other the other difficulty is is that it 's just 
if if you take the admonition to to feed my sheep and the question is who are my sheep 
uh-huh 
and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they 're hungry 
well bless your enemies 
if your enemy is hungry feed him 
if he if he needs your asks for your shirt give him your coat also 
so if the the the the south vietnamese 
they asked us to help them right 
is that right 
but yes 
uh they did 
the i think the the biggest difficulty is is that when your at an agrarian economy like south vietnam was that in reality uh 
the the poor farmer poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes and the question is who was he going to pay it to 
um-hum 
um-hum yeah 
uh the communists or the uh alleged democrats uh democratic form of government 
uh-huh 
and i i think that 's i think i think uh that 's a little was a difficult part there 
and and i 
we did n't understand the culture 
we could n't uh 
we had uh we had a a young lady that was fourteen that worked in our in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old 
and and the people looked like children i mean you could n't imagine that one would would would conceal a bomb and and and do these kind of things 
um-hum 
yeah 
i think culturally it really destroyed a lot of the people that that went over and saw these people 
you just could n't believe that they would that they would be mean and and and drop bombs and kill people 
and then we would turn around and and napalm them you know 
um-hum 
if and i think there was a lot of a lot of tearing of emotions 
um-hum 
and i think that if anything that when schwartzkopf he was saying the idea that we learned we l- we learned a lot from vietnam now it was it was it was in general bad 
um-hum 
but and i do n't know the problem is now 
i 'm i 'm concerned a little bit that that now that the gulf war is on that we 're going 
to think it was a good war 
and it was okay to go beat up on people 
yeah 
and i think that i think we need to a little more justice at home 
i 'm not sure how we get that 
whether there 's a connection there 
but 
yeah 
but then again yeah 
i 'd say it is wrong to invade kuwait 
and i 'm not saying president bush made the wrong decision 
i think i 'm lacking in my 
i do n't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the vietnam war because i 'm going to interpret that through the bible 
and i 've kind of always 
i have been a christian five years 
and i 've kind of avoided that that those the war things and how god approaches that because i think its just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to come you know need to decide what i feel 
in any event well the difficulty is is if you look in the old testament and and the numbers of places that uh the lord went out and just simply struck down 
and that was part of the problem when they went into the promised land that they that they uh they did n't destroy everybody 
right 
right 
they left a woman and a child or the cat the sheep 
and that that 's and and that that you know 
yeah 
and you 
i think that 's one of those things when we get to heaven we 're going to ask god 
i know 
why did you do it that way what do you 
but then again though jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i 'm saying like 
so he did n't just say do n't kill your do n't kill your enemies 
but do n't only do n't kill them bless them 
you know and so therefore when we have an enemy come against us i really feel like but i really feel like i know i do feel this strongly that when if we had someone come and attack us the best way to handle it would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you 
what can we do to rectify this situation 
and that god would move in that sovereignly 
and he would get the glory though no king no 
bush would n't because it would n't make any sense you know what i 'm saying 
yeah 
it 'd look absolutely ridiculously stupid 
but it would work out because if you follow the scriptural principals it 's going to work out because those are that 's the best way to do it you know 
but the thing is is that then god gets the glory not a president not a king 
and i think that 's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory 
well and i- i 
and even at the even at the local level when somebody 's assaulted what do you do turn the other cheek 
um-hum 
no 
well i believe personally 
i ho- 
i this is where everyone always says my husband always goes through that i go 
yeah 
for one if someone broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to to to take authority over that 
and i know people that have done that 
i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes and just say i bind you in jesus name 
your 
i just 
and rebuke any enemy because i believe it 's a spiritual war that 's going on 
and it 's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home 
illegally that 's not normal 
there 's something going on there 
and that i would have discernment by the holy spirit to be able to pray over that 
do you see what i mean 
yeah 
and then the same in vietnam 
you would you would n't handle vietnam the same way you would handle uh saddam hussein 
but i just i have a problem with all the killing 
but i 'm not a new ager i do n't believe 
means that i am not for one world government 
i 'm not for all these new age things 
i- i do n't have a problem with uh national identity 
and i 'm an american 
and having different nations and all of this 
but i am concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like god has a better way to handle it than that 
and 
well my family moved to texas about eight years ago 
my husband was raised here but 
i i have never lived here 
so um wh- when we came back to texas i i was really kind of excited 
there was n't a state income tax 
and there was n't a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things 
um-hum 
and all of that was new to me 
so i 'm sort of feeling like we 're getting a better deal here than what i was accustomed to 
yeah 
w- did you move from the the northeast 
well i lived in missouri and then in utah 
and then um and both places had pretty good state income tax 
and um we 've always paid tax um you know on everything we purchased you know even food at the grocery store 
so i thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your gro- groceries 
and but i think i mean i i do n't enjoy paying taxes 
and it 's hard 
but um i think that 's what we have to have to you know have our streets and and have our government and excuse me and have and have the services that we need 
and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that 
and i think i guess what i feel is that most people um they do n't like to pay taxes because they feel like well there 's some people who are n't paying their fair share 
um-hum yeah 
i thi- 
yeah 
and um that makes you feel bad 
it 's the people that can really influence the government and have all the money to 
right 
and you know when um when last year the the elections were going on the governors election and state and you know 
i i did n't have anything against um clayton williams personally or anything 
but um it was kind of hard for me to think here 's someone who as wealthy as he is 
did n't have to pay any income tax 
that he said that year 
he claimed he had did n't have to pay income tax 
and he thought well you know 
there 's some people are living pretty pretty good life styles 
but they 're not paying income tax 
and that 's not fair to me 
no 
and there 's you know some people who uh are abusing the systems that we pay taxes to support 
and all of that makes us feel bad 
but i think you know all in all how i feel is that um i 'm willing to pay the taxes because i think i like our country compared to the other countries i 've studied and visited 
and um i 'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services i enjoy 
how do you feel 
well yeah 
i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get 
and i think that you know i do n't think there 's probably any really pu- that system that everybody would think is fair as far as being taxed 
um-hum 
um-hum 
you know i guess in texas with 
uh we live here also 
um-hum 
and that it 's mostly sales tax 
so it 's really the people that have the money to buy things that are paying the more because they 're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff 
um-hum 
i 've lived in texas most of my life 
we um lived in kansas city for a couple of years 
and we were kind of in for a rude awakening 
they had personal property taxes on like cars 
and the first year we 're there it was like eight hundred dollars 
uh-huh oh no 
and we 're like you know what happened is 
my husband said i used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in texas 
and now you know 
uh-huh 
so i mean that was kind of different 
and then to file a a state income tax was also kind of tough too 
um i guess since we 've been married we 've moved a lot 
and so it always seems like you know we 're always paying in taxes for something 
and so th- it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little bit of money back 
but i um have accounting background 
um-hum 
so then i also have done tax returns in the past and for other people when i worked for accounting firm 
uh-huh 
and uh you know it is kind of sad to see all these people that you know have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put their money in places they do n't have to pay taxes 
right 
or to buy something that loses money so that they can you know offset the income that they get or whatever 
yes 
so but you know i think if i can understand maybe why the rich people do n't want to pay you know a large large percent 
um-hum 
because i- you know that 's not really fair either 
if they 've earned their money by themselves well you know people just kind of given the money 
yes 
it 's kind of depressing sometimes i think 
well it is 
and um and sometimes i think um well for myself that the income that we have we 're paid a certain salary 
but i think the employer keeps in mind this 'll be deducted you know 
some so many taxes will be deducted from it 
and so i think we 're you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it 
yeah 
and so i think you know in that way we 're compensated um just by our society 
yet you know they do n't pay you um what just what it would take 
and then if if you pay taxes on it you would n't have any money left over 
and and um but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything um i wish that they would i guess because i 'm not one of them i wish that they would um you know realize that they they could n't make this kind of money 
well yeah 
that 's true 
they could n't live that kind of life style anywhere else 
yeah 
in that 
even if they made that kind of money there 's some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things and that 
yeah 
they um they would n't be able to enjoy the uproots that and that 
so that you know they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it 
yes 
they 've earned it 
and yes 
they 've that 's great they 've you know had such great fortune here 
but they need to pay for it too because they could n't do that somewhere else 
yeah 
um um i like texas um not having the state income tax 
and i hope that 
because um you know that we 've had enough industry here that i guess it 
is that why we do n't the 
industry here is able to to um fund the state because we have oil here and things 
i mean that 's what i 've always heard 
is that um 
but they must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years that that really has n't been the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes i would n't think 
big boom 
yeah 
there 's something about um the industry in the state that um 
yeah 
there 's enough 
i know we moved here from houston 
and um the city had it 's enough money 
it was really nice that they had uh but 
they began to cut back because of the oil problems 
but um you know they would ha- have um so many community outdoor theaters and and like uh community country club type things 
um-hum 
that the 
it was such nice services to offer the residents in the city 
and i really liked that 
do n't you have to 
why people just kind of deba- expect certain services 
um-hum 
then then they do n't really think they should pay for them or something maybe 
i do n't know 
yeah 
it 's true 
and i 'm you know like 
the the property tax that we pay and everything is so much higher than my parents pay in missouri 
but um i 'm i 'm comfortable at least this year with we 
pay we have some good schools you know 
the school thing might be changing 
but i 'm i- willing to pay for that for my children 
yeah 
and i 'm willing to sacrifice i guess 
i mean i 'm not going to be the kind of person that 's going to grumble about the taxes even though we 're paying pretty high percentage 
um i feel like you get what you pay for 
and i want to be here 
and i i enjoy i enjoy living here in this country 
and having seen other countries i 'd much rather live here and pay taxes than live somewhere else and and not 
um-hum 
anyway well i guess i better let you go 
well it was nice talking to you 
yeah 
it was nice 
i have n't ever i need to i 've never initiated one of these phone calls 
do you call in 
do you get to pick the subject 
or 
talking no 
no 
they just define it to you 
and so so you get what get uh luck of the draw 
do they kind of oh 
i see 
but 
yeah 
yeah 
anyway well good luck to you 
okay 
you too 
bye-bye 
bye 
okay 
hi 
hi 
okay 
you want to start 
um yeah 
sure 
um i think i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back 
if you can n't pay for it you should n't have it 
period 
and that 's just 
that is very true 
however our whole economy is based on loans 
um-hum 
uh uh but but right this moment you probably have several loans out 
or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something master charge 
well 
i do n't have a master charge 
thank you 
but uh see that our whole system is built on on owing on borrowing 
right 
but that 's the problem see 
as our system should n't be based on owing and borrowing and all that 
uh true 
but uh uh uh without it people would n't be able to own automobiles 
or they would n't be able to own a house 
yes 
they would 
they just would n't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own 
we might have to you know just be able to 
i think if we a generation went without debt then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i we 're twenty eight if we lived our lives and did n't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford which we would n't be destitute 
i mean we would n't be living on the street by any means 
but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds 
but i feel like the generation after us w- oh man it i would be so good 
it would be so much better 
it would n't be perfect 
but then they could learn to live with wh- what they could afford to save to buy 
and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer 
well now i agree and uh i agree with you one hundred percent 
uh-huh 
i 'm just taking the other side just so we 'll have a discussion here 
uh but i still go right back to what i said 
when is the last time you had uh fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile 
but see i we made poor choices in college 
we took out two 
both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans and i look back on that 
um-hum 
and i bought shoes 
i went shopping 
i did not need that money 
i did not need it 
i did n't need it 
i should n't have even qualified to get it 
i did n't need it 
and it would have been a little rough 
i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli 
but i did not need it 
and as i look back now now we 're paying that back 
i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it 
but do n't take out ten thousand dollars in loans 
do n't do it 
and i do n't i hope do n't think he 'll have to do that 
but i just so like we might if we did n't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that 
and i believe we would have because god 's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know 
but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free 
and they pay cash for everything they buy including new vans 
uh-huh 
and so so i guess i 've seen it done 
and i know you can do it you know 
but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van 
and that 's where americans do n't like to do it 
and so and we do n't want to cut back our services from the government because we 're spoiled 
well i have one way to suggest reducing the budget 
what 
very simple 
just take all these civil service employees and and uh uh take some of those holidays away from them like columbus day president 's day 
i know 
i mean they g- they get all these days off 
yeah 
now give them what a a week 
i know 
i think we here at ti get a total of eleven a year 
um-hum 
and that 's about uh three or four less than civil servants get 
uh-huh 
now just look at that money the government could save if they did n't have all of those days off all those holidays 
yeah 
that is true 
because i always think the mail never comes on these days 
and you 're like well what is it 
you do n't even know it 's a holiday 
well now do n't forget the mail is something else again 
that has nothing 
they 're not civil servant people 
but is n't that federal in the federal budget 
no 
no 
they have their own budget they go by 
but is n't it part of our in- 
it 's not part of our taxes 
no 
it 's not 
you know that 's why the price of mailing a letter keeps going up 
that 's why it keeps going up huh 
you know i could i can remember the days when it only cost three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter 
that 's another topic 
those stamps are valuable now 
yeah 
they probably 
hey 
i ought to go looking through some of my old mail 
that 's funny 
yeah 
and that is a good short term thing though 
that little things like that that 
overall though i just think we 're just going to i do n't know see 
i know 
i guess i 'm kind of leery of this topic because i know that bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations 
but i see that to be a potential power problem later with um who 's going to be in charge with this new world order 
and i you know i 'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place 
but i know we already have a new money sys- 
we already have new bills printed for us treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency 
and i mean i 've seen them 
and so i know that the long-term vision for the us government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh 
but i 'm concerned with whose going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know 
that 's a lot of power for one or two people to have 
and so um i guess because i- i guess i feel like i know what their long-term vision is i 'm kind of like you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles 
and i do n't think americans are willing to do it 
well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments 
how do you feel about that 
i do n't i do n't feel we should loan them money 
if i- 
i wish our leaders were really seeking the lord on these things 
and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine 
but i do n't feel we should be loaning money like that 
i mean it does n't work are they 
well in so many cases it 's not a loan 
it 's just a g- a giveaway 
going to but it 's not but it 's not set up as a giveaway 
if it were set up as a giveaway and it was something that 
i mean our our president and our leaders could be seeking god saying god is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money 
is it your will this money and your will for us to give to them 
and i believe if we gave it no strings attached that god would bless our nation 
but because we 're our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires 
i mean none of these nations have paid us back 
it be do you understand it 's i guess it 's a principle of giving and receiving 
you give it no strings attached 
and they may never give you anything back 
but because there 's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back 
and it might not be money 
it might be um no taxes on our things our computers going into their nation 
it might come back in another way 
but it would be come back 
but because we 're loaning it i think that 's the problem 
and i do n't mean give it to everybody that asks 
use a lot of discernment 
do n't give money to every nation 
you know what i 'm saying 
i think we 're loaning money to too many nations 
but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them 
and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money 
and so i just think we 're never going to get that back you know 
do you understand 
no 
that that 's true 
i- i understand that france still owes us money from world war i 
um-hum 
and uh world war ii debts have never been repaid 
i think the us just wrote them all off and said well we 'll cancel it just like they did to the that polish debt here uh last week 
yeah 
um-hum yeah 
uh uh half the countries in the world simply canceled the poland debts to help them 
right 
long wh- long term though do you think it would be best to see an a one world you know 
you can n't alleviate all national debts 
or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking god on how to turn our nation around financially 
that 's my opinion 
my opinion 's the latter 
uh-huh 
well uh i 've got to respect your opinion 
you have some uh solid ideas 
um-hum 
i know 
but what 's yours 
do you agree 
or do you disagree 
or i mean what do you think long term 
well i do n't believe in a single government or a single control for the world 
um-hum 
uh that 's asking for trouble 
people are too different 
um-hum 
i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the us and find tremendous differences between the peoples 
they have their own ideas how things should be run 
um-hum 
so therefore i do n't believe there could be a single government for the whole world 
there 's too many societies involved uh 
the language barriers 
um-hum 
uh oh sure 
th- somebody said years ago well let 's make it english uh an international uh language 
um-hum 
that 's a big laugh 
we can n't even make english a a national language here in our country 
um-hum 
we 've got too many uh uh uh immigrants 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
they do n't call them immigrants anymore 
that was back during my granddaddy 's day 
yeah 
different ethnic groups 
a well yes 
yeah 
but 
yeah 
i know what you 're saying 
uh my grandfather came over from lithuania back uh just before the turn of the century and uh as a matter of fact he 's a draft dodger 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
he uh was supposed to serve some time 
well he did serve his time in in the uh the militia 
uh-huh 
and he came back 
he was a civilian again 
and his father said well if you 
okay 
so do you have do you have the long 
i guess not not if there 's 
see i was raised in new york 
but i guess up there you all do n't have too long of a growing season do you 
uh well we probably have about three months approximately 
do you do you do you do your own gardening 
um-hum 
um-hum 
we live on a 
it used to be a farm 
but we do n't farm much 
we uh but we do have a garden 
huh see i got mine in 
well let 's see 
i put in pepper plants this weekend 
oh 
i wish i could be doing that 
and uh yeah 
i got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen 
and i enjoy tinkering with it you know 
uh-huh 
it 's pretty hot down here during the summer 
we hit you know a hundred hundred and two sometimes 
uh-huh you right 
so you know we do n't do too much during the summer as far as tomatoes and stuff like that 
yeah you almost have to get started pretty early probably i guess 
but yeah 
i can usually i can put in oh probably mid march i can put anything in the ground you know beets and onions and stuff like that 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but then i have to wait for my 
tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks as soon as we 're sure we 're not going to have another freeze then i 'll finish it 
uh-huh 
yeah 
you 've had more freezing this or this yeah winter i think 
yeah 
we 've had just a few you know that freezes a little here and there 
more bad weather 
but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of april 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and it 's pretty tough 
um-hum 
are you do you work 
or are you retired 
or you 
no 
i work um i 'm only forty years old 
uh 
i have to work 
uh my husbands retired 
but he 's not a gardener 
he he he 's been helping me more 
but he really is n't re- uh real crazy about gardening 
well i i really enjoy it 
it gives me time outdoors 
but 
and you know i 'm a golfer 
but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house 
uh-huh uh-huh 
uh-huh 
an- and i burned my grass off here in the last couple of days and getting ready to start for the spring season and see if i can grow me another nice lawn 
oh 
uh-huh 
i usually have a pretty nice lawn 
it 's a lot of work you know 
um-hum huh oh yeah 
but it 's 
but it 's a pleasure to like you said it 's good to get outside 
and and i like i like my garden too 
yeah 
it is 
we did n't have to we have just a small garden 
but we planted corn last year too that which takes quite a bit of space and we we did n't have too good luck with it 
uh-huh 
because the uh we had a couple good real good wind storms 
and it really damaged the corn so we did n't get too much corn last year 
oh yeah 
we 're going through that 
we going through the dust storms down here now 
uh-huh 
so but i uh what i did with my garden is i have a a two by six frame that 's five by ten 
i have two of them sitting side by side and then i put uh like a black plastic 
uh-huh 
it 's really not a black plastic 
it they call it weedex and i put that down 
oh 
uh-huh 
and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that and i use a one of those black soaker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i lace it up and down there a couple of times 
hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and i only have to water about two hours a week and it 's pretty nice 
oh that 's great 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
especially during the summer it keeps everything wet instead of wilting 
yeah 
we do n't we do n't usually cover ours 
we did a few different times 
sometimes we 've covered with the plastic 
and other years we 've tried newspapers and uh but we generally do n't we do our watering from our spring 
oh 
oh you have a spring 
uh yeah 
how nice 
we have an old fashioned tub sitting that you know water runs into 
and and uh my husband set up a pump that runs 
uh-huh 
it runs till it 's down 
and then it stops 
oh uh that 's pretty nice 
and then when the water comes up it comes on again 
and we use that to water our garden with 
so 
but you actually enjoy it huh 
oh i do 
i 
love it 
get out there on your hands and knees and crawl around 
i 'd rather be doing that than housework 
i un- i can imagine 
you all have much trouble up there with insects 
or 
uh not a whole well not a whole lot 
i think our cabbages and broccolis and that we have more trouble with that type of thing with the the 
with the worms 
yeah 
yeah 
i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs and i have n't figured out how to get rid of those yet 
uh 
uh-huh 
uh do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally 
or do you use insecticides 
yeah 
i try to 
no 
i uh uh try not to use any insecticides at all 
i try not to even use insecticides on my lawn 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but i sometimes i can n't manage 
uh-huh 
yeah 
well our lawn is is a big lawn because because we live out in the country 
and so we were not our lawn is not perfect you know 
it 's just the it 's just a lawn 
yeah 
yeah well mine 's full of dandelions now 
if uh-huh 
so 
do you eat any of them 
no 
i never have 
i do n't know how to prepare them 
oh did well did does your wife ever make uh a bake in a hot bacon dressing like for salad 
no 
huh-uh 
oh it 's delicious 
and it goes real good on dandelions 
really 
um-hum um-hum uh uh-huh 
huh 
i 've never eaten dandelions 
now i 've tried dandelion wine but i 've never tried any dandelions just to eat 
this 
is the use the greens and you get them when they 're young and tender you know before they 've grown too too taut 
yeah 
because they do get a little stringy 
all right 
but uh they 're kind of fun to to try 
yeah 
get a get a few 
and throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes 
i 'll try that 
yeah 
yeah 
i sure will 
i do n't know but i 've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband 's back 
and he 's been having trouble with 
so was n't allowed to run a lawn mower 
oh oh 
so it takes about four hours to cut our grass 
oh 
and we have we have hills 
i 'm afraid of the hills 
but i 'm getting on to it 
yeah oh so you all are into so you all are into the lawn big time huh 
i just pretend they 're not there 
and i just go ahead and do it 
yeah 
yeah 
i only got well i guess i got 
um my whole section of my house is probably maybe a tenth of an acre and i have a pretty nice backyard 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and you know i 've got enough room to throw horseshoes you know couple of other 
oh that 's great 
great 
that 's a lot of people do n't have that much space even 
odds and ends no 
and it 's nice 
i 'm just inside the city limits 
i 'm probably a mile mile and a half inside the city limits 
and i 'm only a mile and a half from work 
that uh-huh 
so you have all the conveniences of a city 
yeah 
it 's pretty nice 
yeah 
and and the country also 
i have the room outside i need 
and i do n't really have all the room in the house i need 
but 
uh-huh well you never have enough room do you think no especially if your into any hobbies or anything 
no 
yeah i have a question to ask you about gardening though 
you know those 
what are they called 
the are they called uh roly-poly bugs 
that 's what my son calls them anyway 
or uh-huh roly-poly what 
roly-poly bugs 
the ones that roll up in a ball 
i do n't know what they 're called 
is it a bug you mean 
they look like they 've got 
yeah 
a worm 
no 
a 
no 
cut worm 
not a grub worm 
it 's not like a 
no 
you find them under bricks and all that stuff where it 's moist 
and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball 
oh 
i do n't know what they call them 
but i 'm plagued with those things 
um 
down here and i have n't figured out 
i even called the nursery 
um-hum 
i 'm trying to think of what they are what kind they would be 
either though see i i do n't know 
you find them under bricks usually and that 
yeah 
under bricks or under wood 
or you know if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long they get in there 
they usually come out at night 
but you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up been laying around 
they 're not a slug 
no 
not a 
a slug is actually kind of slimy an- and these are just 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
he plays with them all the time 
he picks them up and rolls them across the patio 
oh really 
they are not hard are they 
no 
are they a hard worm 
no 
they 're not real hard 
they 're not a hard 
they 're like a water bug of sorts 
huh 
i do n't know what they called 
oh are they black then 
them yeah 
yeah 
but they roll up 
yeah 
i can n't think of what kind they would be 
when when you touch them they roll up 
uh-huh 
i 'm no help on that then because i i can n't think of what they are what they would be 
but i 'm plagued with those 
i think you have a lot more insects down there even than than what we have 
you know i think it 's be- probably because we 're in more of a tempered zone 
you know we do n't really we only freeze down here in january and february at the most 
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i know my brother had trouble with fire ants and that even 
you know 
yeah 
i got fire ants too 
uh yeah 
and they be can be a real dickens 
and you spray in one part of your lawn 
and they just move to another part 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
so you got to spray your whole yard 
yeah 
yeah 
and then your your neighbor gets them 
and then he sprays his yard 
and you get them back again 
yeah 
you keep trading them 
so yeah 
but we 're not doing too bad down here really you know 
the daffodils are out 
and 
yeah uh-huh uh-huh 
ours are going to be coming out 
now our cancer society sales daffodils 
right now they 're they 're big now 
so we we have daffodils for in the house because of the cut flowers 
and uh yeah 
yeah 
but they 're just beginning to come out the end bud 
yeah 
see mine are up and bloomed already 
and 
oh 
oh 
they sure are pretty 
oh 
i like them 
they 're such a nice bright early spring color 
and the snap dragons are starting to come up yeah 
and then in in my back flower bed i have uh tiger lilies and they bloom in you know late june mid july 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and they 're beautiful too 
and they 're yeah 
they are 
they 're real nice 
yeah they 're beautiful 
but they 're they 're nice and green now you know 
they 're up above a foot maybe eighteen inches 
uh-huh oh my 
they come up real pretty every year no problem 
yeah 
no 
we wo n't have too much here for another couple of months yet 
is it still pretty cool up there 
really yeah 
yeah 
we 're ha- it 's raining today 
yeah well do you all have a 
what kind of grass do you grow up there 
do you grow uh bermuda or 
well our grass like i said is just grass 
we really did n't plant anything 
it 's just 
rye 
so i suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even 
or okay yeah 
and uh 
see we i have bermuda in my yard 
uh-huh 
now i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there 
um-hum 
but bermuda seems to be 
it 's probably very pretty 
yeah 
bermuda seems to do pretty good down here 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
we have some people that have done their lawns 
an- and uh 
okay 
um what do you do this weekend 
well uh pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard 
hum which is 
wh- d- what do you plan have planned for your yard 
well uh we just bought our house uh last july 
and it 's it it the house is forty years old 
so there 's there 's an established lawn and what not flower beds things like that 
but they 've uh they 've gone a few years of neglect 
um-hum 
so we 're in the process of uh revitalizing the whole situation 
we 've got um different flower beds in front and uh a window box a built in window box um trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up uh get rid of a few weed problems and things like that 
hum 
so 
what part of the state do you live in 
uh i live in dallas 
oh okay 
okay 
my wife and i we live in dallas too 
um 
okay 
yeah 
just what that area 
we 're planning on moving to flower mound 
and we 're going to be getting some wheel 
we 're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there 
yeah 
seems like it 
uh the place we 've been living at it 's uh we 're we 're just leasing in 
the in plano and the soil has so much has such a high clay content that uh uh i went to use my dad-in-law 's tiller and it about tore my arms off the sockets 
um-hum 
i 'll bet 
i 'll bet 
i mean just just scratching two or three inches was just a chore 
it was it was 
and then when it gets wet you know you do n't even want to get out in the yard 
right 
it 's horrible 
right 
it 's a nightmare 
but um i do n't know what what i- 
um where you live is there a real high uh alkaline or ass content 
or 
yeah 
it 's pretty high alk- w- 
ac- actually it 's done uh 
it 's in the north end of oak cliff in uh kessler park area 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh we 've got about 
i know right where that 's at 
yeah 
we 've we 've got mayb- maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil 
um-hum 
and then it 's solid rock from then on down 
so 
really 
yeah 
it 's uh a little aggravating 
we can n't we can n't put in anything too big um as far as uh shrubs and things like that because they 've got to get a chance to find the find the cracks in the rock 
golly 
but uh 
is it is it limestone under underneath 
yeah 
it is 
it 's it 's solid limestone 
or how do you put trees in there 
uh you just we 're just happy that there 's trees already there so far 
hum 
um anything like that is is a uh major undertaking i guess uh 
sprinkler systems or anything uh start to get real expensive because there 's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock 
but uh 
and it you know no- not even consider considering a pool or anything like that that 's that 's practically has to be blasted in i guess 
oh 
but uh 
and it makes it makes for a a different challenge 
i 've never 
well i- i moved to dallas about five years ago 
yeah 
and uh i never really messed with anything uh gardening or anything like that until now 
but uh i- i keep hearing all the stories of of different parts of town 
in fact uh we even we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that 
um-hum 
and the first thing the the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said uh i 've got i 've got a dozen different varieties 
and each one works in one part of town 
and that 's it 
that 's basically what he was trying to tell us 
oh yeah 
oh yeah 
we trie- we tried planting tomatoes last year 
and it they they turned out pretty poor 
yeah 
i just i wi- i just wish i 'd known the the variety and everything 
yeah 
it 
but but it it 's amazing we also have roses 
and i mean they just grow so beautifully 
yeah 
that would 
in fact we put in some uh some more roses yesterday 
um what um what type roses 
uh different uh a few different uh hybrid tea type varieties 
oh hybrid teas 
yeah 
yeah 
we we have a few uh of the real short stem 
they 're kin- they 're kind of like the bush roses 
okay 
but uh i do n't know i think it 's i think it only has about five or six more years to go because it 's a it 's a really old bush 
yeah 
and but i- i i 'm i 'm amazed because the sun is so intense 
and the roses just seem to survive just fine there 
yeah 
that 's we that 's what we 're searching uh 
we 've got we 've got all the different lake editions around the house 
and we 're we 're kind of experimenting right now 
um-hum 
we do we 've got the direct sun in front 
and the backyard has two great big uh spruce and and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall 
so the backyard is just complete dark all day long 
and 
and uh we 're we 're struggling to find something for those areas 
uh yeah 
have you have you uh done a done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not 
no 
they 're they 're in pretty good condition 
yeah 
uh we 've been we 've been pretty lucky on that 
yeah 
just if you want a lot of you know light for underneath that may be the all right because we had because we have some we have some old fruit trees 
uh-huh 
we have a plum that 's just about ready to go 
uh-huh 
so we may just be getting rid of that 
but but our peaches they they seem to be doing just fine 
but they they really need pruning 
yeah 
it it just seems like they that that even you know pruning once a year is really not enough 
but the the way they behave 
that 's true 
that 's true 
i do n't know 
but uh but uh what kind of uh what kind of what kind of grass are you growing 
it 's uh bermuda 
bermuda 
yeah 
yeah 
oh i 've i 've been trying uh uh a mixture of uh the bermuda and the rye 
okay 
and but i may be working like a fescue in because of you know the type of weather 
it seems that uh bermuda 's bermuda 's fine 
but um it looks like it would hold the soil 
but it really does n't 
right 
a lot of a lot silt that comes in it just does n't seem to hold it very well 
yeah 
but uh but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime 
okay 
but uh but boy once it gets over seventy seventy five degrees that it just dries up shrivels up and dies 
um-hum 
but 
yeah 
it 's uh 
there 's such a there 's such a difference through the year uh 
yeah 
my my parents-in-law they 're they 're building a house into the side of a hill um 
well it 's already been built and everything 
uh-huh 
they 've been living there for about three months now 
but uh this is out in west texas 
uh-huh 
but the the wind there has been so bad that i- i mean they 've tried to plant grass 
and they just have some problems big time problems 
that 's it 
they just they just washing uh watching their lawn just blow away 
yeah 
oh yeah but it 's but it 's quite an undertaking 
they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property on a on the side of a hill 
oh wow 
it 's beautiful 
i mean you can see the house from you know miles away 
um-hum 
but it 's you know it 's a pretty neat little job 
but they save a lot of they save a lot of energy 
yeah 
but just uh you know for them i mean they they 're going to have to start gardening 
it 's going to be from the ground up 
yeah 
i mean the whole way 
yeah 
and they said well we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just getting this property developed 
it 's amazing 
i mean they have have the all they have are mes- uh mesquite and cottonwoods 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh it 's it 's all on lake greenbelt that property out there 
okay 
and uh i do n't know that what they have 
they have all the water they want 
um-hum 
they can they can actually they can pump water 
i mean they have to get permission 
but they can pump water up from the shore 
okay 
but uh that 's for like an additional 
they have to pay like some kind of fee per year 
oh okay 
but uh they 're uh right now though i think they 're just they 're trying to get the trees planted and everything 
sure 
but man i- i just think of all of the money that they that they 're going to have to spend just getting that 
but the taxes alone there lake greenbelt 
and some places they they they really they over tax 
uh-huh 
and i mean your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes 
wow 
it 's it 's it 's ridiculous 
that really is 
it it would 
it seem like it be just the opposite when you get 
yeah 
no 
no 
it 's not it 's 
because even though it 's far out there it 's just that lake greenbelt you know they have to they they try to do it just from the selling the water 
um-hum 
but um the water usage you know they try to limit even though there 's three or four streams that flow into it people still use it enough in like in towns like clarendon and other areas that where they irrigate 
um-hum 
they huh they they still have n't gotten used to the dry land farming 
but the irr- irrigation because it 's gotten so bad the past few years 
yeah 
that 's true 
but i do n't know 
i just came back from there 
and just the air is so dry 
i do n't see how anything can survive out there for long periods of time 
should say 
my father-in-law says the mesquite trees is are they 're they 're they 're pretty smart 
they 're smart 
they 're about the smartest tree around 
they do n't they do n't even start growing until may may or april like after it 's been raining for a few months 
yeah 
that 's true 
that 's true 
they say the roots have developed 
so that 's all they work on 
just a leafy 
they do n't do anything 
um-hum 
yeah 
that 's something i 've been uh been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are at this time of the year 
um-hum 
and you know we 're trying to decide what what to what to put on one side of the house and things like that 
but there 's so many things that they they last for just a couple of weeks 
and then it then it 's just a a bush there from then on 
it 's kind of it 's kind of disappointing 
i- i know 
my my wife and i we planted on the on the south side of our of our house we planted some gardenias 
um-hum 
and they did real fine during the summertime 
it 's just 
but during the fall when it stopped when uh the rain let off just a little bit it i mean it just dried up 
yep 
and uh so i guess it these plants they just they do n't 
it 's like they remain 
um hello um 
what is your favorite um food for a dinner party 
um i do n't know 
i- i think i make things you know 
that i do things kind of simple because i- i you know i just have close friends over 
i make like lasagna 
and uh oh we like to have barbecues outside so you know when the weather 's nice because in texas you have a lot of nice weather 
so we do a lot of um things like that 
um i 'm not really into gourmet cooking 
so i do n't know how to do that 
so i do n't have gourmet foods 
do you do tex-mex 
um yeah you know 
like fajitas an- and stuff like that 
so 
oh fajitas 
how do you make fajitas 
um it 's kind of like made out of skirt steak 
and you marinate it 
um-hum 
you can buy marinating mixes here 
i do n't know if get it up there 
oh 
or you can you know marinate it in any kind of barbecue sauce you like 
and then you um you quick fry it real fast wi- in hot hot grease you know not a who- not not deep frying it 
but you can either barbecue it which is really good with uh green beans not green beans but green peppers and red peppers and onions 
oh 
um-hum 
and um then you put it on a flour like you know 
you make your meat real um thin you know bite size pieces 
um-hum 
then you put it on flour tortillas with you know guacamole and um sour cream and you know all kinds of you know 
k- it 's like a tex-mex type thing 
oh it sounds good 
it 's really good 
you can do it with chicken too 
chicken fajitas and stuff 
okay 
so 
well that 's nice 
so what kind of cooking do you do up there 
oh well basically um because i lived in the middle east for a while i tend to fix middle eastern foods when i have have people over 
oh that sounds interesting 
and so um some of the dips are like um chick peas mashed with um sesame 
uh-huh 
and um called foo- um 
what 's it called 
i forgot what it 's called 
anyway and and lem- 
you cook them so often you kind of forget their names 
that 's right 
that 's right 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's called humus 
now i remember it 
oh 
and um uh dipping arabic bread the thin pita bread in that 
uh-huh 
or another dip is made with very similar but with um eggplant which has been actually barbe- 
it ends up with a barbecued taste although we usually bake it in the oven 
or if we have uh 
those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just by putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it black on the outside but mushy on the inside 
oh 
that 's unusual 
i 'd never heard of anything like that you know 
here in texas it 's all you know tex-mex cooking and barbecue 
and they 're really big on stuff like that 
and 
but barbecue is it like steaks 
or is it uh turkey 
yeah 
yeah you barbecue s- 
pardon me 
would you barbecue a turkey or a chicken 
or 
oh yeah 
you can barbecue turkey if you have a big enough grill 
but my i cook my turkeys inside you know 
it b- 
you can buy smoked turkeys 
uh-huh 
and or uh but most the stuff that we barbecue is like steak and chicken and hamburgers hot dogs you know the simple things like that 
um-hum 
and you know we we like things like that you know barbecue beans or baked beans and 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i 'm sure that uh the chicken that we barbecue from the middle east has a lemon garlic sauce 
i would n't imagine that a barbecued chicken would 
no 
no 
this is more like hickories hickory type you know depending on the barbe- 
uh-huh 
it 's like a smokey flavor if you 've ever you know had stuff like that 
um-hum 
yeah 
it 's totally different 
sounds like it would be interesting to eat some of the middle eastern cooking 
so 
right 
right 
yeah 
well it 's been fun talking to you 
yeah 
it 's been fun 
it 's been ni- 
it 's uh you know neat to learn some what different people eat 
so 
right 
you get to think you know 
i come from wyoming 
and it 's basically the same same type of thing except for you do eat more the tex-mex down here 
so 
uh in wyoming it would be less spicy 
yeah 
yeah 
you you know 
down there it 's just like meat and potatoes you know 
vegetables once in a while 
yeah 
right 
oh dear 
well it 's been interesting to talk to you 
okay 
very good 
thank you for calling 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay um 
now the term personal computer uh 
i do n't happen to have one at home um 
but i do have a personal computer on my desk here 
a type of work station 
yeah 
uh yeah 
just kind of it 's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to to uh shall we say bypass the formal procurement process 
and uh it it works just fine 
it says it 's a monochrome monitor panasonic printer uh no big deal 
it it does the things i need for it to do 
is it a two eighty six or three eighty six base machine 
no 
it 's not even that 
it 's eighty eighty eight 
uh i think that 's about where it is 
okay 
uh what type of uh utilizations do you make of it 
word processing obviously 
uh yeah 
i do that 
i i do uh some lotus on it uh do some uh samna some uh pfm uh nothing extremely complex 
okay 
uh i use them both here at work and at home 
uh-huh 
and i have ibm clones in both cases 
yep 
here at work i have the ti one thousand which is a three eighty six base mach- machine 
oh yeah 
i bet that 's a pretty nice setup 
yes 
it is 
uh unfortunately i need all of it 
yep 
uh for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that 's a third of a meg in beta size 
wow 
and that i know that uh brings an eighty eighty eight machine to it 's knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it 
and he had a two eighty six machine 
yep 
and it brought it to it 's knees just in the ability to handle 
wow 
and then i have uh a three eighty six fx a sixteen bit machine at home 
uh-huh 
and i 'm really pleased with it 
uh-huh 
it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches 
sure 
uh-huh 
uh what i 've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them 
have you 
yeah 
yeah 
to try to make them more effective and useful 
right 
have you been uh struggling along those lines 
well um i seem to always be in the the next to the last generation of word processing software 
when everyone was in samna i was still in pfm 
and now that i finally become proficient in samna everybody 's going to wordperfect 
so i can never quite stay current with that 
well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it 
it 's uh 
i used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it 
it was a real memory hog when you started making large block changes to it 
uh-huh 
the 
at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error not a fun thing to try to recover from 
oh 
huh 
i can bel- i can believe that 
very frustrating 
uh but again i 've been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise 
uh that was a engineering spec on b2 
you come here with the b level of specs 
no 
not really 
i 'm not that up on that sort of thing 
well it 's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you 're trying to build uh to one level down from assistant description 
oh okay 
oh okay 
okay 
oh well it sounds like you 're pretty much into computers 
well i sure need them 
uh there 's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them 
i can believe that 
well it 's it 's been interesting 
yes uh 
maybe you 'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things 
i think that 's when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have 
when you start seeing what all they can do for you 
yeah 
of course needs and wants are n't necessarily the same thing 
well i understand that you know uh 
if needs and wants were the same i 'd have a four eighty six machine at home 
oh it 
is is that the newest thing now the four eighty six that that must be a fairly recent release 
right 
uh that 's 
came out around the first of the year 
okay 
okay 
because i i had done capital packages for two eighty sixes and three eighty sixes 
but i did n't know they had a four eighty six just yet 
it does a few more things uh than had been available before 
uh-huh 
yeah 
but i 'm not sure that it 's such a massive improvement uh you know 
once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation because you no longer can think that fast anyway 
sure 
yeah 
well okay 
i enjoyed our discussion 
i did too 
and you have a good day 
you do the same 
bye-bye 
bye 
all right 
now we used to be big time campers 
but now we 're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports 
uh-huh 
what type of camping did you do 
well when we before we had kids we was in a motorcycle group you know 
uh-huh 
w- we went like twenty or thirty at a time 
we took uh just our little tents 
uh-huh 
and we did it that way 
then when we started having children we bought a camper 
oh uh-huh 
you know and we did it that way 
oh how neat 
so we 've always enjoyed camping 
uh-huh 
well i know i have um i just have a tent 
and the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent 
uh-huh 
and then i bought a van 
and that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable 
ye- yes 
now we have friends with a van 
uh-huh 
and when they go on vacation a lot of times they 'll just sleep in the van you know like one night 
right 
yeah 
and the next night they 'll stay at the motel you know or something like that 
uh-huh 
and they enjoy it 
yes 
i do n't i do n't think i 'm a real true trooper you know when it comes to camping 
oh yeah 
oh me either 
all the bugs and stuff 
but i i try 
i hate to be on any that stuff 
but but i try you know to uh to get out there and enjoy everything 
oh yeah 
but what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends 
and he got poison ivy 
oh 
and it 's all over him 
the poor thing you know 
so there 's definitely hazards to going camping if you do n't know what you 're looking at 
yes 
yes 
oh shoot 
oh 
but now i enjoy it every once in a while 
i mean it 's not something i 'd want to do real often 
uh-huh 
i 'm a sissy 
yeah 
i either want to do it in the fall or spring 
right 
right 
you know 
definitely when it 's cool 
yes 
well have you done much camping around texas 
well not really because usually it 's when we go off you know like for a couple weeks or so 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
it 's usually like that 
yeah 
well have you camped all over the united states 
just about 
wow 
just about 
see now i have n't so that 
i bet you that 's an experience there 
oh it really is 
uh-huh 
it really is 
uh-huh 
also i said we mostly did ours before we started a family 
right 
right 
it 's a lot easier then 
well i know my parents like to camp a lot 
and they uh they 've been going to gulf shores alabama and uh which is really really neat 
oh uh-huh 
they said they 've got the white beaches and the sand 
yes 
and it 's not real populated so they can they feel like they 're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean 
uh-huh 
and uh from what i understand from them it 's really really pretty there 
oh 
i 'd like to go anywhere 
you know i just like to go 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
i really do 
well have you done much camping up in kentucky and and those parts in the mountains 
no 
not really 
not that much 
um we 've been well we 've been to wyoming you know and kentucky and montana and you know places like that 
but usually if we 're with a group of people we really do n't stay any one place very long 
uh-huh 
you know like if we 're just going through and they camp one night and then head on 
right 
right 
but now that we have children and we go every blue moon i 'd rather just go to galveston you know 
yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
rent a beach house or something yeah that 's that 's my idea of camping 
yes 
yes 
yes 
but we 're uh we 're getting more into it 
and we 've done uh we 've done quite a bit 
and uh uh the kids like to go out you know as often as they can 
uh-huh 
um so that 's good 
you know they 're they 're becoming enthusiasts then of camping 
uh-huh 
it is 
my children really enjoys it 
they really do 
but by the time we really get a chance to it 's july you know 
right 
and it 's so hot 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and our camper doe- does n't have an air conditioner 
oh yeah 
yeah 
it 's one of those pop-ups 
i 'm sure you could put one in probably 
uh-huh 
but we had n't did that 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
well that 's really neat 
yes 
well 
we all enjoy camping 
and they 're you know they 're in like r as and scouts and stuff like that you know 
uh-huh 
so they get to go camping in those organizations also 
uh-huh 
at least their daddy goes with them 
i do n't when they do that 
yeah 
but 
yeah 
oh that 's neat 
that really is 
that 's really neat 
well how old is your boys your children 
well i well i have um a son that 's uh going to be eleven here pretty soon and then a daughter that 's thirteen 
uh-huh 
so they 're they 're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and cooking and and all that kind of stuff too 
oh yes 
yeah 
yes 
and that 's that 's really neat 
it really is 
mine 's eleven and eight 
uh-huh 
so they really enjoy it too 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i i agree with you 
they like to get out there 
and but this was n't so fun this last time for nathan to to get out there 
and he did n't realize he was touching poison ivy 
and it got all into his eye 
and it was really swollen 
and uh so they had to give him shots and everything 
so 
oh well maybe next time he 'll stay away from those particular trees or what bushes whatever they are 
yeah 
yeah yes 
yes 
oh 
but i have uh brother-in-law and a sister you know that just really just camp 
you know they love to go camping 
uh-huh 
they could they would all the time they wanted you know wanted to because there 's nothing holding them back 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but i 'm just not that involved in it 
no 
now i like to go out like several times a year but not on a on the regular basis 
yeah 
i have some friends who go out every single weekend when you know in the season 
oh 
uh-huh 
uh and and i just could n't do that you know 
me 
i have n't really as far as entertainment 
i do n't know what you would do if you know 
yeah 
yeah 
but i guess my entertainment 's television i guess 
just getting away 
yeah 
right 
right 
see i see 
they just want to get away 
uh-huh 
but every friday night they 'll go home you know straight from work 
and they 'll pack up 
and you know and then they 'll leave 
and i 'm just going you know 
by friday night i just want to crash you know 
and i want to go home and you know do all that and then uh get out on the road to boot 
oh i do n't either 
so 
uh-huh 
but anyway that 's their life 
yes 
but they probably live in a city also do n't they 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
well see we 're in a real small county area 
uh-huh 
and you know that makes a big difference 
now that 's true 
that 's true 
because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles you know 
yeah 
that 's true 
that makes a difference 
well it was nice talking with you 
it was nice talking to you too 
okay 
and we 'll probably be talking to you again 
okay 
well take care 
okay okay 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
where do you live 
uh in the houston area 
uh-huh 
well i used to 
i lived there for a long time 
but i 'm now in palo alto california which is i think the recycling capital of the world 
oh that 's great 
so we have many recycling activities 
and i 'm in in full uh support of all of them 
oh we are too 
our community is uh just starting to get organized about it 
they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our our things and dump them off ourselves 
um-hum 
and uh 
well that 's something 
but it it seems to me that we 've gotten a whole lot better um cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh 
actually i do n't think we pay very much extra at all too 
but the um garbage men come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb 
uh-huh 
i think that 's great 
there 's a few places in houston where they 're trying that out 
i do n't know if it 's the if they 've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh bins 
yeah 
we have burlap sacks 
oh 
and they give us one for uh aluminum and uh steel one for metals and one for glass 
uh-huh 
and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags 
so we have we leave three little piles of things out on the curb every thursday 
and the garbage men come by and uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they 're still in good shape 
oh that 's great 
and the it really pays for itself because oh then the city gets the money from the recycling 
uh-huh 
yeah 
we 're we 're all for it 
our um 
we 've got several bins in our on in our garage where we uh you know sort things out and and take it to to the appropriate places 
yeah 
the one thing i wish we could recycle is magazines 
but they claim that because of the way they 're bound they uh it 's too expensive to recycle them 
at my office we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail 
yes 
and they 're uh 
one 's for white paper 
and one 's for colored paper 
so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or things like that goes in those boxes 
um-hum 
but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines 
and there 's no way to get rid of them 
it just seems like such a waste 
oh it does 
it does 
but i 'm sure that they can uh find some sort of uh use for them if you know you know there 
i 've seen talk about uh using garbage for uh energy 
um-hum 
and so you know you could always apply the magazines toward that 
well that would be a help 
i wish they would do that here 
we have got so little landfill space left that we 're going to run out before the end of this decade 
yes 
and it 's really going to be a mess when we have to start hunting for places to put the things 
oh i know it 
we did have uh another novel uh experiment start this year 
now we can put all our yard clippings out 
oh 
you can you buy these super giant heavy duty paper bags 
they 're about four feet high 
uh-huh 
and you get them for i think it 's about fifty cents a piece at the grocery store um you usually buy them by the dozen 
um-hum 
and then you put all your yard yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible 
oh uh-huh 
and those and the garbage men also pick those up on thursdays 
oh that 's great 
and then the uh they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is and now in full swing 
and at the end of every year uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flowerbeds 
right 
well that 's a great idea 
i wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our city was so involved in that involved in recycling like that 
yeah 
because you know i 've talked to many people 
and we would n't mind going its extra effort to do it uh 
if they make it so that it 's not a horrendous inconvenience i think most people would 
yeah 
oh yeah you know 
and i do n't mind you know 
at first it was the the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that 
right 
but now you know i do n't mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we do n't get reimbursed 
no 
i think it 's i- it 's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up than to get that two cents when you take it to the store 
uh-huh 
oh i oh i know it 
we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans for cash 
um-hum 
but so few people uh have enough to make that worthwhile you 'd spend more in gas getting down there than you get back 
right 
yes 
and then the plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also 
now do the grocery stores in houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags 
we have 
i know of one that the one that we use uh has uh recycling for the bags 
uh-huh 
and uh and they 're promoting the cloth bags you know the reuse reusable cloth bags 
yeah 
well we can get a nickel a piece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused 
oh that 's great 
they just take it off like they do a coupon 
they just subtract it from your bill 
oh 
and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags 
uh-huh 
and they say you know as long as it 's clean they do n't want the a plastic bag that 's full of goop 
yes 
here they do n't want your rotted tomatoes 
but they want any clean and dry plastic bag 
so i keep 
and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that we 're saving it to recycle 
so right outside the back door i 've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles 
uh-huh 
and there right outside the that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers 
and now we 've got the bag for the plastic bags 
i understand uh 
my husband about once a weekend he 'll go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out 
oh yeah 
and he 'll go pick them up because he just can n't stand that 
he he 
well how nice 
that 's great 
and uh it 's so you know 
he we have all our piles of of recyclables also 
um-hum 
i remember at christmas the the only thing that i 'm 
when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they di- uh provided a place for us to take our christmas trees uh to for them to mulch for for city use 
um-hum 
yeah 
well that 's 
they just put all our christmas trees in the regular uh compost pickup 
an- uh-huh 
so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh three weeks after christmas 
uh-huh 
right 
and uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse 
it would have to be cut into four foot lengths 
so you know if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four foot lengths 
uh-huh 
but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags 
well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there 
and they even picked up our uh styrofoam pl- packing materials 
they brought uh the week after christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody 's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we 're trying something new next week only if you have any uh of those little uh styrofoam peanuts that any of your christmas presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and we 'll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them 
right 
well see that 's one 
but i 
that 's not going to be a regular feature 
that was just a one time thing right after christmas 
well the 
but uh something nee- does need to be done about the styrofoam that uh 
well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills 
oh yeah 
i mean they do n't uh uh 
they do n't mash 
no 
they do n't compress at all 
and they stay forever 
right 
and i 've seen where some places have taken a plastic and uh they 're recycling them into other plastics and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that 
um-hum 
and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines 
yeah 
i do too 
the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile 
it they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff 
right 
uh because otherwise uh you know they 're not going to go house to house collecting it 
and you 're not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts 
um-hum 
right 
oh i was thinking about you know like the uh the styrofoam used at uh the fast-food restaurants that if everybody uh 
yeah 
and so 
yeah 
i know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam 
but uh 
now we quit that about two years ago no three years ago when we got china mugs for everybody 
um 
so and the only difficulty with that is that we 're in the middle of a five year drought 
and so i- it 's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or uh china cups to use up our water 
but at the moment we 're using the china cups 
and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year 
and then uh you 're supposed to keep it recycled every day 
well that 's good 
that 's uh 
yeah 
they should last a while 
well let us hope that everybody 's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things 
because 
i believe we are 
i- i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening 
yep 
and so it 'll it 'll be good in the long run 
it sure will 
well i enjoyed it 
well good to talk to 
well what is your view do you consider the soviet union a threat 
i do n't know that it 's so much a military threat anymore as a 
well you know i- it- it 's real confusing right now to know what kind of a of of a threat it is i guess 
sure 
it it takes awhile to to get used to something 
you know if if they have completely chan- 
the place has completely turned that much around to where they 're not you know not what they used to be 
right 
uh 
it 's it 's hard to to know anymore if it 's uh a threat one way or another because uh it used to be s- so much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it 
um-hum 
and now that with gorbachev is introducing more i guess freedoms or expressions of freedom it does n't look as though you know everybody 's following the same pattern 
yeah 
and uh 
th- the people who are you know the staunch military conservative people 
you never know well gorbachev 's future is like whereas whereas in the past it was seen as you know whoever was the head of uh the communist party was seen as you know untouchable 
yeah 
yeah 
i thi- 
you 
know th- the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know we 're getting uh sucked into something here you know 
if if somebody 's about to to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we 're we 're ashamed we 're not going to do that anymore 
um-hum 
y- exactly 
and uh um you know i 'd i 'd like to think that that is n't true 
but uh i- i 
you know the evidence is that uh you know he 's he 's let some some stuff go you know the east german situation 
right 
it 's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible 
you know if i 'd have been asleep for five years and read it in a book i 'd say no no no that did n't could n't have happened that way 
right 
well it it 's amazing just because of the drain it 's been on you know both economies that our economy is of course been able to uh withstand that a little better 
um-hum 
but uh the russian economy 
they you know they 
i do n't know what the percentage is 
but i heard it one time 
it 's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and finally you know who knows 
maybe they 're finally waking up and saying you know we can n't afford this 
uh the us is n't the threat that we 've always made them out to be you know even if they 're saying that beneath the doors 
um-hum 
but it 's hard to think that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period 
yeah 
even if it is you know the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many people 's toes who are comfortable with the way the situation is 
yeah 
yeah 
i- i think you know what i 'd have to 
i- i gue- i guess to answer the question directly i 'm still just a a little bit you know leery of the whole thing 
um-hum 
what i have n't seen is the uh you know a great stepping back in the military situation 
right 
you know it 's it 's one thing you know to let us go ahead an- sort of disarm 
and you know i even had a thought once that the whole iraqi thing might 've been just a a deal to go ahead and let us uh you know expend some some military hardware 
expend 
of course it did n't turn out that way 
uh-huh 
and uh uh that that may have been a a a kind of far out way of thinking about it i do n't know 
well it 's interesting anymore the world 's getting so small that it does n't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism philosophy tha- that was here in you know twenty years ago 
um-hum 
yeah 
uh but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on it have have not been world powers 
so it 's easier for us to say you know to an iraq you know uh you can n't do this get back you know or we 're going to force you 
i 
do n't know yeah 
or or we can do something about it 
yeah 
whereas you know if the soviet union would 've who knows what taking over mongolia or or something like that who is really will we 've been more just rhetoric uh rather than going in there officially uh or you know physically and try to to remove them 
um-hum 
yeah 
well th- the china situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around 
and then all of the sudden it was like somebody in the in uh red square or wherever said okay 
and that 's enough 
uh-huh 
and the tanks came in and you know pretty much took care of that 
exactly 
and 
yeah 
uh that 
personally i do n't see as gorbachev as being maybe a threat 
and i think he 's actually honestly trying to do some change 
um-hum 
but i do n't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either 
yeah 
well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the united states and suddenly took off toward you know just s- some pretty hard by the socialism 
um-hum 
and uh you know th- the reaction 
you know th- the economic 
well the uh the social structure of the soviet union you know it it 's it 's coming apart at the seams 
uh-huh 
you know and i 've heard people say well you know it 's just like the american civil war will there be a union or not 
well no 
it 's not the same sort of a thing at all because that the whole soviet system was put together under total force 
you know there was no 
as as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it 
right 
um-hum 
you know they uh nobody vo- 
you know a lot 
man those people did n't vote to become part of the soviet union 
they had no choice 
yeah 
that was always kind of interesting 
people 
you know a lot of my friends have a taken the stance of you know these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away 
and i 'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic 
you know if i 'm a soviet an- if part of you know south let 's say south dakota wanted to succ- you know succeed am i going to stand for that 
yeah 
now i realize that the origins are are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with uh and that they may have been forced i 'm not that familiar with their future 
um-hum 
but i you know i 
it 's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than uh a volunteer or willingness to join 
yeah 
but 
there there was uh the whole thing was put together you know by force 
there 's there 's no no real question about that 
um-hum 
and some of the countries that were forced in at th- later dates is the three baltic countries you know came in in the forties 
um-hum 
and uh it 's well it 's not that they came in it 's they were conquered by the germans 
and then just never given back 
and then the russians even took it back from the germans and never bothered to give it back you know 
yeah 
so that 's a a little different situation 
well that whole uh 
the whole i- idea if you look at the russian history and i guess all countries the way it used to be is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer 
um-hum 
and that was the whole idea of why they had so many buffers 
and maybe you know more and more people are seeing or countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer is n't going to help you 
you can 
li- i guess like with uh israel is a perfect example 
yeah 
the reason they have the angolan heights and the the uh all their buffer area is between jordan and uh the sinai an- and lebanon was just as a buffer 
but you know as you can see with the the scuds go right over there 
um-hum 
yeah 
they do n't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers 
yeah 
there 's there 's very little that that buys you anymore in today 's technology 
i knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to germany that said that 's the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over germany 
and they 're going to land in other places 
you know that 's going to be the safest place to be 
that 's probably very true 
ve- 
that 's very interesting never thought of that 
yeah 
yeah yeah well uh i- i guess what they 'd have to do to 
uh i really do n't know 
you know in in the uh in you know i hope that what 's happening is exactly the way it appears 
um-hum 
you know some reason or other you know i- is uh it 's kind of a strange thing we 've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute 
nobody knows to do 
you know what 's uh what 's what 's really happening here 
is it real 
uh-huh 
but you wonder how well this thing 
bo- who was it boris yeltsin the guy that 's running the uh or evidently was elected president of the soviet for the russian republic which is i guess the uh the biggest 
right 
exactly 
i get confused between all the which is the soviet provinces versus what are the the russian provinces versus what are 
um-hum 
well in the center 
but you got uh the the great big area that 's just was traditionally known as russia 
and then all these little nationality groups around it you know that were you know was there nineteen of them or or whatever 
um-hum 
you know and these were all the soviet autonomists you know they had some real fancy names for them 
right 
a matter of fact when the 
uh yeah 
what i read when the uh the uh united nations was setup in in san francisco one of the first things the russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the uh of these you know republics as a separate country 
oh as a 
you know so there 'd be there 'd be nineteen rather than one 
as a vote 
sure 
sure 
and uh the united states said well that 'd mean we get to bring in forty eight you know 
and uh that sort of 
you know they backed down on that 
died down on that 
i thought it was interesting that recently here the warsaw pact no longer exists as a military military force 
but it 's merely an economic now 
yeah 
well i wonder if that 
well y- i mean at 
wh- uh wh- whether get shot by something that 's called uh an economic force or whether it 's called a military pact 
yeah 
exactly 
you know it 's all 
you can change the name of something 
but i wonder if it 's still exists 
um-hum 
although i 've seen some evidence that you know the uh the russian soldiers 
well 
the funny thing there is they 're not particularly welcome back home because there 's they 're having a housing shortages now 
what do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by uh bulgaria and and czechoslovakia 
exactly 
an- and all the 
and now all of a sudden they 're going home 
and somebody 's got to pay for their 
well that 's what they 're saying the whole problem you know with if we were to demilitarize europe 
what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there 
yeah 
well that 's not 
what 's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have uh a million plus people in the indu- you know in each country from the 
yeah 
yeah 
the question was uh what kind of books do you read for entertainment uh uh i guess 
oh i just read for escape 
okay 
well i mean it 's 
with two little kids i can understand that 
yes 
it 's that 's simple 
i read to escape 
and i do n't read any parents magazines either 
oh 
so 
what uh what kind of 
well i just finished just i just finished one last night a great book 
it it 's very a typical for my reading though but a great book one called the things they carried by tim obrien 
hum 
and it 's uh 
god 
i do n't know if i would call it a collection of vietnam war stories or if i 'd call it a collection of vietnam love stories 
oh 
strange book beautifully written 
um-hum 
just beautifully written 
by uh somebody who was there 
or 
yeah 
a guy who was there as a uh foot soldier 
um-hum 
so he considered himself to be you know a a true vietnam soldier 
yeah 
well any of the guys that were ground 
yes 
yeah 
i can imagine 
yeah 
so what 's the latest one you 've read 
yeah well i tell you what 
i 'm a kind of uh a history nut 
i 'm trying to think back now 
i read an awful lot of uh periodicals and uh you know almost what you call reference book 
uh-huh 
and uh the last uh i 'm embarrassed to say the last you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i can not right offhand i tried to read uh one of the the michener uh lone star or the the texas history book 
i have never been able to make it through any of michener 's work 
oh well i 've had similar problems 
it does tend to to 
have you are you a civil war buff at all 
yeah as a matter of fact 
yeah 
because i finished one 
i think this is like two years ago 
and somebody had given me one of these dinky do crappy women 's novels set in the civil war john jakes one 
yeah 
and the novel did n't do that much for me 
but boy the period of time was fascinating 
uh-huh 
so i then read was it battle cry of freedom 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i think it was battle cry of freedom 
it 's kind of like a historical compendium of the civil war 
yeah 
and it 's not a story of the civil war 
it 's a story of all the politics and uh lobbying and just basically state by state events that led to of the events that brought about the civil war 
uh-huh 
and it 's fascinating because i had always you know have been raised on this you know emancipation proclamation with the civil war 
uh-huh 
there was a lot more to it than that were n't there 
there was a lot more to it than that 
as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought 
yeah 
well it was a political move 
oh yeah 
it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because you know it was uh if you read it it only emancipated those who were in areas uh in rebellion against the united states 
all the other areas which would i think at that time would have included west virginia and oh may have been kentucky a few states you know that were not part of the south but still had slaves 
um-hum 
they did n't emancipate them 
well you know what else really surprised me now 
i 'm married to a native texan 
and i 'm not 
um-hum 
uh 
i 've got the same problem 
yeah 
i 'm glad you put it that way 
and i have two native texan children too 
yeah 
my husband is always you know talked about texas being a uh rebel state 
is n't 
and oh my god all this civil war pride 
i kept waiting for 
where 's some reference to this god damn state of texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the civil war 
is n't much there is there 
they might as well have not even been there 
you know they were n't a state 
and the only the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to you know who 's going to be going there 
and i keep telling my husband that 
and he keeps saying oh no 
i thought okay 
they supplied some uh you know 
they were some groups uh the vicksburg 
if you ever get a chance to go over to vicksburg the battleground at vicksburg uh there 's an area there where there was uh some texas uh groups 
and they had an interesting time there 
oh i 'll bet they did 
and down there at sabine pass uh i can n't think of the guy 's name 
but he held off the you know just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole union navy for a while from coming up the sabine river which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story 
well you know why they actually held them off 
none of the yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar 
that could be it could be it 
now you did n't hear me say that 
outside of um 
and then the last civil war battle was fought at val verde you know 
over there on the texas border you had a lot of of groups heading for mexico 
and they were cut off at the pass more or less at eagle pass 
and they did n't get across the river there 
so they 're the last 
and that was actually after the war was over 
but it was the last organized battle between the two units was in texas 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
texas participation in the civil war was uh minor at uh 
at best 
boy 
do n't tell that to a native texan though 
yeah 
i mean my god they fought and won the whole thing 
yeah 
well my wife 's from galveston 
so 
ooh 
yeah 
well i 'm from new mexico 
so you know i was 
that 's a beautiful state 
that 's a beautiful state 
see i was raised in the midwest which you know hell we did n't even you know we did n't even know where the mason dixon line was 
um-hum 
and besides you know if corn did n't grow there it did n't matter 
it sounds like iowa or something 
iowa and nebraska 
um-hum 
yep 
and then i had probably lived the last eleven years in massachusetts 
so you know what does that make me an honorary yankee 
hum 
or god knows what 
yeah 
on 
yeah 
oh well my sister 's living in illinois right now 
so 
well then she 's going to come out well rounded 
yeah 
but outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that i 've really gotten into reading 
i think this is because the kids are getting to me is science fiction 
um-hum 
i 've always kind of enjoyed it 
i- i used to read a lot more than i do now 
well i 've gone to the point where my husband my husband travels i get out like you know two or three books 
um-hum 
and i i 'm trying to think of oh isaac asimov robot series 
yeah 
i mean i think i 've read all four of them 
and i understand that there 's a fifth 
um 
in the last six weeks he 's been on the road a lot 
i just turned around and looked at my brief at my briefcase my uh bookcase up here 
and i see armageddon up there 
and uh the shadow of blooming grove and two thousand and ten and grant takes command and the war in the year oh space gee that was the one i was trying to wade through was space james michener did n't get very far on that 
you know i think i read hawaii when i was about ten years old 
yeah 
or so 
yeah 
which is about the developmental level that you know you need to be at to read those things 
and i still even then i was so so disgusted with it i- i tried to read i do n't remember which other one it was 
whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller 
yeah 
and i just i got about like a hundred pages through it and realized i had like a thousand more 
i thought i can n't do this 
yeah 
it really 
the the books are kind of uh imposing to say the least 
yeah 
no 
let 's see 
here 's one called ghost towns and mining camps of new mexico 
now not too many people have read that one 
i do n't think 
no 
and there 's the history of yoakum county texas there 
i 've got uh 
is that a big thick book 
yeah 
and i 've got yeah and i 've got a history of kingsley iowa 
what the what the hell for 
why kingsley iowa 
well because that 's where my folks all came from 
oh okay 
and they had a centennial here awhile back 
i read the grant takes command 
that was pretty good 
well 
that was part of that trilogy that uh bruce canton did 
now that 's one that 's one 
i do n't know 
see i had never really been into science fiction that much until uh somebody gave me mist of avalon probably about five or six years ago 
yeah 
i do n't know if i 'd call it science fiction or fantasy 
sometimes it 's awful hard 
some of those get very philosophical 
they can be in any setting 
they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting you know 
the 
well i loved that novel 
and then somebody said oh god this would have been even long ago because i was in boston 
and it was raining all night 
and i had a hole in my roof 
and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse and uh i was reading dune which seeming rather ironic 
oh 
yeah 
and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out you know like ten gallon buckets of of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little freeman steel suits 
uh-huh 
you 're reading dune 
and i think that 's probably my favorite of of any piece of science fiction that i 've ever read 
that was a movie too was n't it 
and the movie was awful 
was it 
oh yes 
it was just terrible 
yeah 
i 'd i did n't see it 
but uh 
yeah 
it was it was beyond 
patrick stewart was in that 
i guess the guy that 's on the new star trek series was in that thing uh 
i do n't know 
i just remember sting was in it 
oh really 
yeah 
and if you were trying to follow any type of uh plot it it tot- 
even having read the book and i 've read that book probably three times watching that movie i could n't figure out what they were talking about at all 
uh 
um-hum could n't 
yeah 
i was real disappointed in that 
well i 'll tell you another good book 
do you like scary things 
um w- well some history books are pretty scary 
have you 
but 
yeah 
that 's true 
have you read the silence of the lambs 
no 
somebody who saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they 'd ever seen 
ooh 
they did n't sleep all night 
well see i 'm i 'm debating whether or not i want to go see the movie after having read the book 
yeah 
i mean the book is is chilling 
yeah 
i have 
just chilling 
no i- 
i do n't have the foggiest notion what it is about 
so 
then i wo n't tell you 
okay 
yeah 
but 
it 's just that if you 're ever ever really want to just be scared out of your wits 
um-hum 
that 's the one 
that 's the one 
yes 
even better than jaws and some of that 
yes 
because the cha- the the character that is so horrible is another human being 
and you 're just drawn into his his horror of him that you begin to kind of like him 
yeah 
oh 
that i mean 
a a freddy kruger type huh 
no 
no 
this guy 's smart 
and he 's suave 
and he 's all the charac- all the characteristics 
oh the worst kind 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
all the characteristics 
well how how do you feel about the immigration laws 
at 
currently i think they are a little restrictive uh particularly for uh certain ethnic groups or from certain countries 
um i think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern europe for example uh particularly the uh the jewish uh uh people from russia 
i think we could permit more of them in than we have uh permitted in the last uh several years 
and i think we have uh uh too much restriction on the uh on the orientals also 
but of course that 's just my opinion 
yeah 
well i 'm not real sure why i got this topic because i do n't think i checked it off on the list because i know very little about the current immigration laws 
um-hum 
um-hum 
well we seem to uh to favor certain uh uh countries particularly south american countries 
and uh there is no uh uh 
i have nothing of course against uh the uh the south americans or uh or hispanics in that sense 
but i think we uh are more restrictive of the um so called eastern uh european countries than we uh uh we should be 
of course that 's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern europe 
so 
oh 
and uh so i think uh you know the um embargo we placed on the uh on the russian jews although we s- of uh spent years and years uh lobbying for their release and their ability to um immigrate from russia as soon as that occurred we simply said that uh instead of the uh hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by uh two thirds 
uh-huh 
so 
hum 
i do not quite go along with that 
but 
no 
that does n't make a whole of lot sense 
no 
and i still think 
you know again kind of having uh uh within this century come from a uh uh an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides 
um-hum 
both my mother 's parents and my father 's parents were immigrants 
so i 'm a little touchy every now and then about that 
yeah 
well uh my uh my family is from uh europe from well from england and ireland and uh have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years 
um-hum 
oh my 
so i do n't have any any uh relatives that i am or or uh several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family 
they were all they were all born here so i do n't have any real strong ties with any with with the immigration laws 
uh-huh 
i do n't because i do n't i do n't have any personal feelings about them 
and i i have n't taken the time or effort to learn what they are 
well i think in a way though uh uh i also have uh an opposite point of view which is uh although i believe we should uh permit uh you know constant immigration into this country um i think we should uh primarily for economic reasons i think we should have um some quotas 
uh-huh 
of course my family and i 
again again that was you know 
my uh grandparents came over during the time when uh there were quotas 
so they had to wait uh you know in uh certain parts of europe for years before they were permitted to come over 
uh-huh 
so you know 
but uh i think unrestricted immigration i think is not uh is not best uh 
yeah 
i- i well i agree with that 
i- i think if immigration was entirely unrestricted uh not only would would the united states become over populated well more over populated awfully quickly i think it it would bring in a lot of uh people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in in other countries 
i think they 'd come here trying to find a new market for their their brand of crime 
um-hum 
well you know there 's another aspect of this too 
they 're also uh uh diminishing the uh health restrictions which 
i was not aware aware of that 
well yes 
there are were some uh regulations over 
i do n't know whether they 're laws passed or or whatever they 're called uh just recently where uh people with certain diseases can not be excluded uh from immigration 
aids is one for example 
and uh recently uh tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh they dropped that also 
uh-huh 
so i think in in s- some as- some ways we are uh becoming a little too egalitarian in that in that sense 
but uh i think we should be a little more circumspect about it 
again my opinion 
yeah 
think we 've talked long enough 
i think so 
all right 
well i 've enjoyed talking to you 
or i- i- i have talked long enough 
okay 
thanks 
thank you 
bye-bye 
good-bye 
okay 
let 's see 
i think uh 
i guess since i call i 'm supposed to start 
i think that 's the way everybody has done it so far 
okay 
but anyway i- i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes 
but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that uh you know the governments doing with our money 
um we 're probably one of the the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have 
the you know 
as far as the quality of the streets the school systems um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to um the you know all the things that the government does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better 
but i do n't think uh anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a a couple of weeks because they 've been messing it up for many years now 
so 
well i have to agree that 
yeah 
and and you 're right 
i mean we you know we do have a good government 
we do have a lot of things that you know show that the taxes are there to support 
but i do think they 're mismanaged 
and i think that sometimes it 's too easy of a i do n't know to easy of an answer 
it seems to the politician to say i 'll tax them if you can n't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending 
um-hum 
um i do n't know what y 'all are paying in dallas 
but you know it seems like we pay the state 
you know there is a 
the taxes is set by you know the the state and the city can add theirs 
and the county adds theirs 
and you know we 're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts 
i came from california 
and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar 
and that was like one of the highest in the nation 
yeah right 
i think it 's seven here 
yeah 
or seven point something 
yeah 
ours is seven point seven five 
almost eight 
yeah 
and it drives me crazy 
i 'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about we do n't want a state income tax 
but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up 
and they do n't do anything about it so 
um-hum right 
do where are you at 
what state 
i 'm in lubbock texas 
oh really 
yeah 
yeah 
there 's 
we 're still we still one of few that do n't have the uh state tax 
that 's true 
and i did pay state tax in in california 
but my goodness 
that that 
the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay 
taxes yeah 
that 's true 
know you do n't sound like you 're from dallas 
where do you co- do you come from originally 
texas 
y- yeah 
i do 
i 've lived in in the dallas area here since i was like four 
or oh okay 
so uh it 's i do n't know rural an urban area i guess 
whatever 
i do n't know 
you just you just managed to escape the real texan accent 
what i 'm yeah 
i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there 
no 
no 
i 've just lived here 
yeah 
but i do n't know 
i- i do 
i can think of all the uh the biblical things about it too 
where what did they say to uh 
i can n't think of this the scripture 
render unto caesar 's what is caesar 's 
that 's right 
so you know even uh i think even in the the story where uh they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh jesus said the money in the fish 's mouth or in the fish 's inside the fish 
yeah 
and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time 
oh were you really trying to find someone at home 
yeah 
yeah 
well you know um back then what they try to do you know 
the would always try to stump jesus try to give him something that would make him contradict himself 
right 
and so that 's what they were trying to do with the tax situation 
and of course that 's when he said well you know you render unto caesar 's what is caesar 's 
you render unto god what is god 's 
right 
and uh a- you know of course there 
i do n't think they really cared about the answer 
right 
they just wanted to try and catch him in something 
get in yeah 
but i you know i believe in paying taxes 
and i mean yeah 
like everybody else i try to you know take as many deductions as i can 
oh sure 
that right and honest you know i do n't want to pay more than i have to 
sure 
and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons 
but i believe that they 're necessary 
right 
you know so i really do 
um-hum right yeah 
are 
where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work 
or 
no 
not really 
i- i we 've i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year 
um i have been married for just a few years 
so i 've had to really switch around from the ez form to the um 
schedule a 
just 
well yeah 
a regular right all the deductions and all that 
and you know did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder 
yeah 
it really did 
i- i saw that too 
i did n't notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and other things 
right 
right 
that 's we 're looking at buying a house 
yeah 
and that 's one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a house 
and it will help tremendously 
is yeah 
we bought ours five years ago 
and it 's 
the one thing 
it seems like you make those payments every month 
and at the end of the year you 've paid all interest and no principles 
um-hum right 
so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back 
yeah 
yeah you kn- there 's a a thing i just 
i 've been trying to learn as much as i can about it 
i- if you pay 
i- i know i get paid twice a month uh every two weeks 
uh-huh 
instead of twice a month 
uh-huh 
so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months 
that 's right 
so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you 'll come out paying a uh one month extra every year 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
and it 'll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note 
that 's right 
my parents uh bought a home in san diego about four or five years ago 
and they did that 
they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other wednesday 
oh yeah 
and that 's exactly right 
even 
though the note is thirty years she said it 's going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that 
um-hum right 
yeah 
uh just because uh exactly what you said 
right 
you 're making one more months payment every year 
right and that 's going on the principle 
it does n't pay any interest 
yeah 
or u- usually it does n't 
so that 's that 's a good way to do it 
anyway yeah 
and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know 
um-hum 
it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner 
um-hum right 
that 's what we 're looking at fifteen or maybe twenty 
yeah 
we 're not going to go longer than twenty 
yeah 
but we 're taking our time 
we 're going uh try to make our decision by july 
well that 's good though 
so and we just started like two or three weeks ago 
yeah 
and we 're not going to just kill ourselves you know 
just two or three houses a week at the most 
well that 's good though 
and yeah 
is it kind of a buyers market down there 
uh 
yeah 
you 'll be well that 's good 
absolutely and the credit union has nine percent interest 
that 's pretty excellent 
so yeah 
so that 's 
i do n't know 
we could n't think of a better time to buy than now 
that 's good 
but anyway well um i can n't think of a whole lot more to say 
well i can n't either 
i appreciate the call though 
yeah 
me too 
i enjoyed talking to you 
and uh yeah 
same here 
my wife uh she went to uh the school out there in lubbock 
in lubbock 
um she was there for two or three years before we got married 
i guess before i even met her 
just a second 
but okay 
go ahead 
but anyway 
so she went to school out here 
i just yeah she went to school there 
what was her name 
at uh cathy walker 
no 
i did n't know any walker 's 
no yeah 
well good luck in your house hunting 
but she yeah 
thanks a lot 
you y 'all work at ti you 
i do 
you do 
yeah 
i 'm in human resources 
okay oh really 
yeah 
wow that 's interesting 
i work in the wa- 
do you really 
see that 
okay i worked with uh with elma 
in the wafer fab- in oh really 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh i used to work 
i- i did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years 
oh wow 
and then i 've just been in human resources the last two years 
and i work with those same people that i worked with all those nine years 
so i feel kind of part of the staff 
yeah 
yeah 
i 'm 
i 'm uh turning in a capital request right now 
you are 
yeah 
that 's funny that 's that 's where you 're from 
what are you trying to get 
uh a machine that puts back grind tape on and off the wafers 
oh 
okay 
so you work in back grind 
yeah 
i 'm i 'm sort of an acting process engineer 
oh okay 
but not officially 
but that 's pretty much what i do 
that 's what you do huh 
yeah 
and demos four 
right 
and 
well good deal 
what do y 'all think of sam 
do most for oh i like him 
he 's um he 's hard 
but i we i think we needed that 
well that 's good 
and 
he 's 
he was very good for lubbock when he came to he d- you know 
it was the same kind of thing 
he he he had a lot of good results 
i mean he um-hum yeah 
that 's that 's what he said here 
good 
he 's gotten us into a linear flow that we 've never been in before 
well good 
and that 's that 's been a real big plus 
good 
and he 's broadened our um the devices that we 're making too which has made us as lot more stable 
oh okay 
well that 's good 
but anyway well it was nice to talk to you 
well you too 
and 
and they 're are going to interrupt us any minute now 
i can tell 
well i know they will 
and besides that my daughter wants me to put her to bed 
okay 
yeah 
me too 
so well have a good day 
y- well you too 
bye 
bye-bye 
well i um i have n't really lived in a lot of big cities 
i mean i 'm living in dallas now 
plano is outside of dallas 
but um so i do n't really have a lot of experience with air pollution 
huh-uh 
but i know when i lived down in houston um on the outskirts of houston there were some towns like pasadena that had oil refineries 
huh-uh 
and um if you would drive by there like on your way to the beach or something there would just be dumping this huge amounts of smoke into the air 
huh-uh 
huh-uh 
and and it always smelled really bad 
we know that that was really um really really bad for the atmosphere 
what have you got up there 
well i i live out in the country 
uh-huh 
so that part is good 
uh we 're maybe one hundred miles from pittsburgh which has a lot of pollution from their plants 
uh-huh 
and right now in our area were fighting against a uh toxic waste incinerator 
oh no 
and uh it wo n't be too far from where we live 
and everybody 's really been you know fighting against it because we just we do not want it 
well we do n't want one any place 
sure 
we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the uh waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh the small percentage that they 're going to be putting into the air is too much 
you know 
yeah 
and it 's just i mean it 's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air 
and and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up 
the uh huh-uh 
huh-uh 
and plus all the problems in uh the middle east 
with all that smoke and 
oh that has to be terrible over there 
stuff and yeah 
so it 's just um you know why are why are we doing this to ourselves 
huh-uh 
i just do n't know 
but um i you know what really amazes me about like that pasadena area and the oil refineries is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it 
huh-uh 
yeah 
i mean between the freeway and the oil refinery you would see a neighborhood 
huh-uh 
and you just thought well it 's obvious that there 's a lot going up in the air there 
and what comes up must come down 
yeah 
yeah 
and we 're breathing it we 're we 're breathing it all the time 
and and we yes 
and and how you know if they have all of those um toxicity 
i mean it there 's signs around saying how dangerous it is 
and then here you are living 
um-hum 
close t- next to it does n't make too much sense 
um-hum no 
and i i figure we 're paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it 
so and they 've shown 
huh-uh 
some of the industries have been real good at uh uh doing their part in uh reducing the amount that that they have 
huh-uh 
uh they 've reused some of it uh 
it can be recycled a lot of their things 
huh-uh 
and that they 've shown that it uh to begin with apparently it does cost more 
um-hum 
but once they get started it 's really it saves them money in the end 
and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way 
um-hum 
and if they would all 
that 's what that 's what we want done is we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it 
well um individual companies and things are so selfish 
huh-uh 
and their desires to save a few dollars and and that they do n't care about the environmental impact that they make 
huh-uh 
they 're greedy 
it 's money is what it is 
it 's it 's the money 
uh-huh yes 
they 're making fantastic amounts of money on these things 
and uh even the the incinerators the money and the income that they 're going to make off of this is you know just astronomical 
um-hum 
well have you ever visited um like los angeles or any place that 's ever it 's kind of known that it has uh pollution in it 's air 
we 've never been 
we went as far as like uh las vegas and yellow stone park 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
we we did n't go we should have gone the whole way over 
but we did n't 
but i understand that 
we have an aunt that lives out there 
and when she was visiting here she would look up at the stars 
well it 's uh-huh 
and and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw 
um-hum 
she said they could n't see those things out there because of the smog and everything 
um-hum 
that 's so awful 
well what about in new york 
i guess you 've gone that way maybe 
else no 
i 've never been in new york 
i do n't want to go there 
yeah pretty funny 
have you been there 
well i 've been to new york 
i have um relatives that direction 
oh 
i have 
it 's um 
where are you clo- is it close to phoenix- phoenixville pennsylvania 
um no 
i never heard of that one 
because i have family there 
and 
we 're near pittsburgh uh clarion university 
oh huh-uh 
it 's pretty neat 
it 's kind of n- kind of northwest part of pennsylvania 
that 's beautiful country up that way 
i know 
it 's um very lush and pretty up in the back in the east 
huh-uh 
it 's really 
you sound very young 
are you a young person 
well i 'm thirty one 
thirty one you 're young 
seems kind of old to me 
no 
you 're young 
you have a lot of life yet 
and and these 
we have some people who say well this is n't going to affect me this air pollution uh older people 
huh-uh 
or they think they 're far enough away from something that it 's 
um-hum 
and they do n't realize that these things are going to affect everybody 
and if if you 're older and it 's not going to affect you that way 
you have grandchildren 
you have children uh nieces nephews whatever friends 
yes 
uh everybody is going to be affected by it 
that 's really true 
and we all you know need to be willing to help pay a little bit 
like i 've heard some people uh grumble about their uh cars passing their emission tests and things 
huh-uh 
and how they 've had to how it 's so much more expensive and things 
huh-uh 
and i thought well it 's so much better 
they say it has really made a difference though 
uh-huh 
now see we do n't have that here yet 
oh you do n't 
no 
we do n't have uh that testing in that down here yet 
hum 
but they 
i have read that that that it has really helped where the problem is greater where the population is greater and that it has made a big difference 
uh-huh 
well i really think it must 
i think every 
i mean well think about how many automobiles there are 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and each is putting out like 
we have a car an older 
one of our cars is an older car 
um-hum 
and every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot on the cement 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and you know that that is a sign 
something 's coming out 
yeah 
that it yeah 
and that 's all all cars are doing that 
yeah 
and it 's really polluting the air 
yeah 
if if you have to put a price on it which is more valuable life or paying a little m- 
huh-uh 
and it 's also that it 's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer and things 
um-hum 
um-hum 
we sure would n't want so much more people suffering from that 
yeah 
and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it 's industry 
we 're paying industry to make the products 
and we 're helping pay for there making these end products that are toxic waste 
huh-uh 
huh-uh 
then we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace 
then they put it in the dump some place 
and they find out well this dump does n't work 
so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else 
we end up paying for it again 
now we 're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators 
huh-uh 
and we 're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted 
pretty sad 
or the the where they want to put the the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the clarion the two water sheds th- that feed clarion river 
oh no 
and you know it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because if that water gets contaminated it will go on down into pittsburgh 
huh-uh 
it will you know it it it affects so many people 
um-hum 
and it 's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this 
no 
no 
it 's scary 
huh-uh 
it 's scary 
it really is 
it 's really awful 
well i 've really enjoyed the conversation 
it 's helped me to think more about some issues that i need to be thinking more about 
it is really a big concern 
huh-uh 
its 
and it 's you know uh instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say it 's important to be involved ahead of time 
a huh-uh 
well you have a good day 
um-hum well you too 
thank you 
huh-uh 
bye-bye 
bye 
okay 
okay 
they suggested that we uh discuss what we think of when we say camping 
yeah 
what do you where do you like to camp 
how do you like to camp 
oh i can camp just about most anyway 
camping or uh motor home is nice uh travel trailer pop up 
i used to uh live in the ozarks and uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods 
oh really 
oh 
you really rough it then 
yeah 
uh-huh 
do you do that very often 
i have n't done it in quite awhile since i moved down here 
uh-huh 
but i used to do it quite a bit 
uh-huh 
you 'd have a lot of hills in that down in that area 
yeah 
yeah it was real hilly 
yeah 
that would be really great 
take a twenty two 
and go out 
pardon 
take a twenty two 
and find a creek 
uh-huh 
that sounds like it 'd be fun 
did you go alone or with a group or 
i used to go with my brother 
uh-huh 
we just lived up there 
uh-huh 
oh that 's great long as it 's not raining 
yeah 
it gets kind of 
i we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain 
um-hum 
really 
oh that would uh-huh 
but i do n't know much about camping in texas 
well i 'm in pennsylvania 
you 're in pennsylvania 
yes 
i did n't know they did this 
are you in texas now 
yeah 
oh 
okay 
yeah 
i 'm down here at ti 
most everybody i 've been talking to is from texas 
but uh we 're up here in western northwestern part of pennsylvania 
i used to be in ohio 
it 's some pretty country up there 
uh-huh 
well you kind of know what it 's like then 
yeah 
so 
but we 've uh we 've done uh many types of camping 
we 've we 've done tent camping 
and we had access to a motor home which is really super great if you do n't want to rough it too much 
yeah 
you can get the they have some nice camping grounds you know that have the water piped out just set it up 
and uh uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and get out of get out of the city for awhile 
right 
just get you away from the everyday things that are going on 
we when the children were smaller we used to go to uh delaware along the o- ocean most every year 
and that was fun 
we stayed mostly in state parks 
and uh we really enjoyed that 
tell you what 
i 'm losing you 
huh 
i said i 'm losing you 
you 're getting fa- you 're fading out 
oh maybe my dropping my phone 
is that better 
yeah 
oh 
but 
that 's so what 
you try take a vacation every year and go out and camp 
yeah 
well we used to 
we do n't as much anymore 
but uh we used to 
we kind of slowed down a little bit 
but uh i think the worst the worst thing is when it 's raining 
if you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad 
yeah 
i know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the ozarks 
uh-huh 
that 's kind of kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping 
i do n't think i would like that 
what kind 
uh copperheads mostly 
oh 
those are n't too pleasant 
no 
they 're 
yeah 
we have some of them around here 
you probably have more there though i would imagine 
yeah 
one year they were they were just everywhere 
oh 
i do n't know what it was 
we had a real rainy spring and then it was all year 
uh-huh 
there was just copperheads everywhere 
uh-huh 
but you still backpacked and camped out 
yeah 
well i lived down in down in the bottom of a big hollow 
and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time 
uh-huh 
if it rained we were stuck back in there 
had a four wheel drive 
uh-huh 
so we could you just get used to it 
uh-huh yeah 
i guess you know enough to look where you 're walking or sitting or whatever you 're doing 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i would think i would think a cave would be could have problems like that too 
yeah 
this cave that we used to go in was little 
it was small 
it was more yeah it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
is your brother younger than you 
or 
yeah 
he 's about a year and a half younger 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
well that 's great 
that 'd be a lot of fun 
you have a lot good experiences from that 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
it was 
saw a few bears things like that 
did you really 
what black ones 
yeah 
yeah 
that would be exciting 
yeah 
the first first couple of times it 's pretty scary 
but uh after that you realize they are just as afraid of you too 
y- yeah 
they 're usually more afraid of you than uh you are of them usually 
so but 
they 're on the increase in this area 
oh really 
um-hum 
i do n't know if 
they do n't have them up there do they 
the black bear 
yeah 
oh yeah 
oh do they 
yeah 
the population 's been r- really up 
they 've uh they 've had longer hunting seasons than that up here even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much 
yeah 
they down here they they stopped for awhile 
or they really made it hard to hunt them 
uh-huh 
i do n't know what it 's like now 
i have n't been back up there in awhile 
yeah 
but uh we we really like camping 
i i must say that uh we ha- we really have a lot of fun a lot of memories in that from camping 
and uh 
well it 's good to get out and smell some fresh air too 
yeah 
yeah 
so 
it 's just so it 's a lot of work too it 's uh gett- you know getting ready and taking care of everything 
yeah 
but it 's um it 's really refreshing 
so 
well i think we 're about to run out of our time 
i think so 
well it was really good hearing from you 
and i hope you get back into camping again and do a little more of it 
yeah 
yeah 
i 'm sure i will 
okay 
thanks a lot 
and you have a good day 
you too 
okay bye-bye 
bye 
well since you live close i do n't know if you know um about what lewisville 's doing with recycling 
are you familiar with any of that 
well i know that um we have some relatives that live um like around the deanne area in there 
um 
i know they 're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there 
yeah 
i you know i read you know 
when they first started doing that in the paper and i read about that 
i was just praying that that you know that would be in our area because we 've been recycling for quite sometime 
and you know we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to almetco you know which is a real pain 
no 
so if they would come up with curbside recycling 
what i 'll do recycle because we a there is some bins like behind wal-mart that take some things 
that would be well now have they moved them behind wal-mart 
yeah 
oh gosh 
because i finally asked because we you know we had all of those milk cartons 
and there was nowhere else to take them 
and they had it in front of wal-mart 
and i ask in wal-mart 
and they said they moved it just behind 
oh 
well that 's really nice to know because we were doing the same thing 
because to take it to almetco you have to take it when they 're open you know which is always a real pain 
um-hum 
and so when that thing came up in wal-mart 's parking lot we thought oh this is great 
and we started taking it up there 
and then all the sudden it disappeared you know 
i did n't real- 
and we 're going oh no there 's our goes our recycling place 
yeah 
well that 's really nice to find out that it 's behind there 
well we pretty much do um uh plastic milk cartons and um um um newspapers 
i could n't even think of what you call them 
ye- 
plastic milk cartons and newspapers an- and cans and glass i guess is the is really the four things that we do 
like aluminum cans 
uh yeah 
yeah 
or yeah that 's about what we do too 
and really i think that 's about th- that 's really about it 
is there anythi- anyplace else that really takes anything other than that that you know of 
well i guess um down in um kind of in north dallas there 's a place that 'll take almost anything 
oh really 
but uh i do n't just we do n't have the room to store all that much you know 
i know 
and i do n't want to be running down there every week or whatever 
i know 
we 're kind of the same way 
an- you know a- at first i do n't know about you 
at first it was a real it was a real hassle 
and i 'm going are we really going to do this 
but you kind of get i guess into a little routine you know and it just be- kind of is automatic now to to throw different things in different places 
i mean yeah 
you know so i 've just got you know 
we have a a pantr- pretty good size pantry in our kitchen 
and i 've just got three trash cans sitting in there 
you know and we just kind of dump things in each one as you know as we get them 
yeah 
so 
i do- think those milk cartons take up so much room 
they do too 
and they 're impossible to crush 
i mean you can n't get them down to any size you know 
i mean you know you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag you know pretty easily 
so yeah you- 
yeah yeah no but i guess we kind of we started recycling after we moved here about a year and a half ago 
oh really 
an- we were using baby food 
and there was just so many baby food jars that that 's kind of what started it 
yeah 
yeah 
and plus some of our neighbors were doing it 
an- you know so when i found out some places to take it 
a- and like um they also take some things at um the flower mound dump behind the fire station there 
and i know that they 're going to use you know the money for that to build some kind of um multipurpose field and that type of thing with put lights and stuff 
yeah oh well that 'll be good 
you know so you know if i 'm not going to get the money from aluminum i would just assume give it to the city of flower mound to do something with you know 
sure 
yeah let somebody get something out of it 
yeah 
then maybe 
they wo n't raise our taxes 
yeah 
to 
that 's true yeah yeah ha-ha 
well i was kind of hoping with 
you kn- do you work for ti 
pay for all those yeah so no 
i do n't 
a friend of mine told me about this program is the reason i- 
no 
yeah 
there was a 
uh that ti 's got this this organization called tad which is tiers against drugs 
and you know we 're recycling aluminum cans up here and uh you know just what you 'd buy out of the machines and drink here 
and there 's crushers out in all of the hallways you know 
and they 're and that 's 
and they use the money from that to fund this tiers against drugs program 
it 's 
you know ti does n't give them any money all everything is made from that 
and they had talked about having a thing where like one saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home you know 
yeah 
and i 'm kind of like you 
i wish 
they would do that because so at least i knew somebody you know was getting the money out of it you know that i- was going to use it for good 
so 
sorry 
sounds like you have a little one just like i do 
she 's uh she 'll be two in july 
yeah 
mine was two in december 
so 
well it was good to talk to you 
well it was nice talk- to you 
i know that they 've started over in richardson where my dad lives 
they pick up newspapers i think 
oh do they really 
curbside pick up 
no so yeah 
i really hope they do that in lewisville 
it 'd make it a lot easier on all of us 
okay talk to you later 
yeah well i- okay bye-bye 
bye-bye 
uh tell you what 
um i 'll let you start 
okay 
um my major source of information i guess is tv news 
excuse me 
i uh wake up to it in the morning 
this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i 'm getting ready to go to work 
oh i quite frequently uh glance through headlines or in the newspaper 
but uh primarily mine is uh tv news 
how about yourself 
or if that 's all right pretty interesting yeah 
i have to have to agree with you um 
normally do n't have time in the morning to to watch the any type of tv 
usually catch it going to work on the radio or when i drag the paper in from the front and it pops out of the bag i usually catch the headlines which is normally what you see the night before on the evening news 
um 
true 
yeah so uh i 've kind of 
um uh we have a one year old in the house 
so it 's kind of hard sometimes to watch tv during the during the during the night 
but i usually try to catch the ten oclock or um um those type of 
uh-huh 
issues i 'd have to say during the war uh there were we were the american public was probably flooded with um uh too much information 
and as far as the sub question about was i s- am i satisfied with the coverage i 'd have to say yes 
but when it came to the war issues it was like who 's telling the truth 
you c- between the channels there was uh the casualties were differently the amount of missiles launched were different 
and it was almost too much information over-communicated 
well that 's true 
but uh i 
uh my personal opinion is that the uh the various network news medias were uh trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military 
true 
i agree with you 
now i can appreciate that especially after what happened in vietnam 
yeah 
which is a is a joke 
uh but i mean let 's face it 
to- today 's uh means of communications we could uh very well a newscaster could very well give aw- away a piece of top secret information and uh pat himself on the back for for uh making a big scoop 
um-hum 
yeah 
that 's a good point 
uh but i would have to say across the board i 'm i 'm satisfied with the way uh the news is is spread 
um of course here at texas instruments uh the rumor mill runs rampant 
the secretary 's probably are the best resource of what the layoff status is 
very true 
i find t news very enlightening 
yes yeah yeah yeah 
and i check that everyday 
and of course with that goes along the the stock price of ti 
yeah 
i agree with you 
i i 'm glad you mentioned that because i think i have to since i do n't have the opportunity in the morning i 'll probably catch the the head lines uh on t news 
that 's a good point 
of course t news i- is more or less headlines 
um-hum 
uh i do n't think much of of their sports coverage 
yeah 
true 
kind of 
all they give the scores 
short yeah 
but uh that 's right 
i 'm not yeah outside of of uh pro football i 'm not too interested in other ga- uh other sports anyway 
least 
but uh the the t news is is a good way to keep up to 
date i think they do a pretty good job selecting the most important items 
um-hum well that 's great yeah 
i do surely do 
uh anything anything else cross your mind 
uh i guess most of us go by the audio which is the the t- television or the radio 
uh-huh 
um yeah but you need to continue to read so you you can people learn to read you know 
well i spent twenty years in prof- in uh commercial broadcasting ten in radio and then ten in uh tv 
and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits a- of bits and pieces of news on the air 
hm 
uh i mean there there are times where uh vide- uh reporter actually will risk is life life and limb 
i 've seen it happen time and time again 
and uh well i remember one time up in nashville tennessee 
was one of the f- fellows got mixed up in a with a riot going on down there 
hm 
but he was lucky 
he got out of it for some reason 
because he was carrying a camera uh they left him alone 
ouch 
everybody got excited 
um-hum 
that 's tough 
that 's tough 
well i 've enjoyed speaking with you 
nice talking to you too jim 
did you get your catalog on y- your your gifts 
no 
oh yeah i just got mine in the mail 
so it kind of inspires me to keep calling 
oh 
well i 'll have to be looking for it then 
yeah they 're not to shabby 
they 're pretty good 
is that right 
yes 
well good 
sir have a great day 
you too 
bye-bye 
alrighty 
ladies first 
oh no 
well i do n't find a lot of time to watch tv 
and a lot of the time i find it during the day when i 'm rocking my little girl to sleep 
so i watch a lot of reruns old shows like dick van dyke and all those old crazy shows 
hm barney fife i guess 
yeah 
i really enjoy watching andy griffith 
yeah well some- 
we- so are you a homemaker 
yeah 
i guess that 's the the right term nowadays 
yeah 
i guess so 
yeah 
i am 
i stay home with two kids 
yeah 
we- my wife 
we have a new one in the house 
and she 's she 's stays home too also 
and 
um i guess i have a wide variety 
i like watching the tv for things that are interesting 
not so much the the bor- the uh the things that are n't 
for example like the cosby show to me is just kind of like a waste of my time and and different strokes 
huh 
and but i like sixty minutes prime time live 
uh-huh 
um course i have to watch cartoons on saturday morning but not the ninja turtle 
ones i like the old-timey ones tom and jerry 
yeah 
you sound like my husband 
there you go 
he really likes tom and jerry and uh bugs bunny and all his friends and all those guys 
-t 's right 
johnny quest you know the good ones 
yeah 
um now i 'll if i 'm ever home during the during the day on a vacation day i 'd i have to catch at twelve oclock the andy griffith show because he 's just you know he 's one of my idles 
yeah 
yeah 
and then uh but i do n't know 
it just seems like that nowadays everything 's so electronic you know an- magnified and and animated that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings 
um-hum 
um-hum 
an- and so uh uh now i do w- the cosby show 
i have seen it a couple of times 
a- and i do 
i i like the show 
i just do n't watch it because of the timing 
um-hum yeah 
but uh some of the crap that 's on tv nowadays and it 's bad 
yeah 
i do watch the special shows that they come out with th- the nova stuff and and the nature shows 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
but um i think there 's enough out there to pick from 
i 'm not 
we do n't have cable to the point of of of the hbo or any of that stuff 
yeah 
and 
but uh 
well i find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children because with two kids 
yeah 
and you know i do n't want them watching something that i do n't think they should watch 
i i used to be really hooked on all my children 
um-hum sure 
oh me 
and i watched that for like oh ten or fifteen straight years 
oh no 
and then i had well you know i 'd eat 
like at lunch at work we 'd have a tv or whatever 
and then um as my kids got older and started you know recognizing what was going on and i thought this is n't really very good 
so i gave it up 
ouch 
fifteen years 
yeah 
bet they hated that 
i had watched it i had watched it since it started 
so 
oh goodness 
it was kind of but now i 'd you know i -id n't know who the characters are 
and um i 'll turn it on every once in awhile 
do n't recognize anybody 
so i guess that 's a good sign 
yeah 
really 
i 'll watch oh i- i used to watch uh 
i can recall 
though this might age me uh date me here 
i can remember staying home when i was five and six and my mother watching the edge of night 
uh-huh 
oh yeah 
well see you 're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the secret storm and the edge of night 
secret storm 
though i think they were back to back on black and white 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
okay i mean i 'm just a youngster 
and i was like oh my gosh 
uh-huh yeah yeah 
we used to 
my mother watched all that stuff too 
and a- as the world turns i think as the world turns may s- i do n't know if it 's still on or not 
well you know still be on 
it was s- not too long ago 
yeah 
yeah now they got a lot other crap involved 
and s- 
yeah 
i do n't know you 're right 
i think some of the tones uh of the the the daily prime time is is questionable 
yeah 
that could be uh 
i have to agree with you 
yeah 
you know keep them on that channel eleven channel twenty one the nature stuff you know 
yeah right 
yeah 
yeah we do 
and it 's real interesting too the difference in my kids 
like um my oldest loved sesame street and those kinds of shows 
um-hum 
my my younger one does n't 
she 's more into walt disney kind you know 
we watch a lot of movies that we 've got on vc- you know on tapes and stuff 
um-hum 
she 's more into the animated stuff where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing 
so but uh we do a lot of kid watching 
um-hum 
hm uh yeah well well sound like you got your hand fulls there 
and i do appreciate speaking with you 
sure 
it was fun 
have you gotten your catalog yet 
no 
i do n't think so 
yeah 
i just spoke to the 
gentlem- i just got mine the mail 
and i inspired me to make more phone calls 
oh well see i have n't really 
i 've had a few people call me 
but i 've never made one 
oh really 
so yeah 
i need to get brave 
check 
out your pen number 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's what i need to do 
have a good day 
thanks good bye 
bye-bye 
what kind of fishing do you enjoy 
well uh normally i like to to go out fishing in a boat and uh rather than like bank fishing and just like you try and catch anything that 's swimming because i 've had such problems of trying to catch any type of fish that uh i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing 
so you like fresh water 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
i 've never tried like with deep uh sea water fishing because you get i get sea sick 
uh-huh 
oh i see 
but one of these days i 'm go- hoping they 'll have some kind of medicine 
so i can go out and go uh deep sea fishing 
now that would be nice have you 
well i was raised on the texas gulf coast in the summers 
uh 
and during the christmas holidays we 'd go down to our house on the coast and so i thought fish came out of the ocean and anything that was fresh water was muddy so i did n't learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun 
um-hum 
oh my goodness 
uh-huh 
wow 
um-hum 
um-hum 
oh i bet it is 
there 's so many different ways to catch fish 
um-hum 
you know at night you can go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that 
which is n't technically fishing 
but it 's a lot of fun 
uh-huh 
so i- i grew up fishing 
uh-huh 
what area lakes do you like 
well uh now i have n't done much fishing here in texas uh because i moved from ohio 
oh i see 
uh but uh we did a lot of fishing when we were up there 
but down here i have a brother that likes to go over on the east in east texas and do fishing 
and i can n't remember what the name of the lake is 
and he was just here this past weekend 
i could have 
i- i think he mentioned it again 
but i could n't remember what it was 
um i want to call it salt fork or lake fork 
i i can n't remember 
but he said it 's one of the best bass fishing places 
oh oh oh uh i think i know where uh lake caddo or something like that 
i you know 
that may be it 
that may be it 
if it 's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places they hold tournaments there and everything 
and it yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
and he said that he has never gone anywhere before 
and he 's fished all over the united states in which they can catch the biggest bass that you 've ever seen 
so i would love to go over there 
they were talking about going over there and some time this spring 
and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and uh and catch some bass 
i would love to do that 
but they have snakes over there 
and i 'm not too welcome around 
i do n't i really do n't want to share a boat with a snake 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
i just i- i i do n't see it 
yeah 
i just i do n't i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something 
i 'd make some quick arrangements and i 've heard so many stories about the snakes you know when they pull in there 's a snake instead of a fish and things like that 
that 's true 
uh-huh 
yeah 
that i 'm just 
oh 
i do n't know 
yeah 
what 's the largest fish you ever caught 
um gosh 
i think it was only like three and a half pounds 
and for me that 's big 
that 's why i 'm saying i love to go fishing because i 've never caught anything really really big 
um so because it 's always been you know in the on a lake and uh 
i know they have bigger fish than that 
but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me 
on a lake 
yeah 
on a la- on a lake that 's not a bad size fish 
yeah 
no that 's a good size fish 
i- i would be impressed 
yeah 
yeah 
so uh but 
yeah 
i 'd love to go ca- catch like the marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing 
i mean you know i 've never done that 
uh-huh 
i 've i 've seen it uh 
and and i have no problem going out in a boat uh 
it 's just so dreadfully expensive 
and there 's just so many other ways you know when you live down there 
yeah 
it 's not a treat it 's what you do every day 
um-hum 
that 's right 
you know 
that 's right 
uh one of my favorite things was we were forever catching crab and steaming them you know out on the on the beach and you know just uh pitching them out on uh on uh what am i trying to say newspaper and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and and that 's it 
yeah 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
wow 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and uh the the other little creatures would take care of what was left 
that 's right 
so going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do 
that 's right 
right 
right 
well do you live like along uh houston down there well i meant when when you were when you were growing up i mean like galveston 
no 
no 
no i live in dallas 
i lived in dallas 
oh okay 
but you uh 
we had a house in port aransas 
oh okay 
it 's a little fishing village that is corpus 
okay that 's close to uh south padre 
well uh south padre is on down the bend it 's like if you drew a line from austin straight down it would be in that region 
oh corpus 
okay 
okay 
okay 
um-hum 
um-hum 
small island 
yeah 
uh 
yeah 
i i 've been to port aransas 
but it was when i was a child 
oh okay 
yes 
because i have relatives who live in houston 
so when would go and we would go to port aransas or then on down to corpus or further 
yeah 
like what your talking about 
because i was just wondering we went to galveston this this summer even with all the oil spills and everything 
i mean i was oh it was horrible 
was it bad 
i well never ever go back 
i do n't think uh 
oh i hate to hear that 
and 
yeah 
and that that 's true um uh you know 
the the water was murky 
and i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there huh-uh 
huh-uh 
no 
i would n't want to eat them 
no 
you know so 
no 
no 
yeah 
you went to galveston 
uh i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water the uh what is it the flagship 
um-hum 
yes 
uh-huh 
is it still there 
it sure is 
i like that place 
yeah 
yeah 
it most certainly is so uh so that it it was it was certain things that were enjoyable about it 
but uh i do n't i think it 's lost a lot of it 's appeal that then because of all the oil spills that they have had 
and uh it always smelled the entire time we were there 
it was 
i did n't realize that had happened for some reason 
yeah 
we went swimming one time in the whole week that we were there 
and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool because the water was so awful 
and 
well of course being raised on the water i 'd never swim in it 
yeah 
huh-uh 
yeah 
swimming is for swimming pool 
yeah 
that 's why they call them swimming pools 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
that 's where you swim 
you do not swim in the ocean 
no 
no 
no 
not anymore 
i 've seen what comes out of the ocean 
and i have no desire to share any space with anything like that 
but really huge sharks are down there 
uh-huh 
i mean incredibly large sharks 
uh-huh 
uh some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night it was incredible the size of them 
um-hum 
wow 
that we would see on the the next morning they would have them strung up across the and it you know 
uh-huh 
so if strung up 
their tails would still hang on the bottom of the uh 
just 
wow 
wow 
yeah 
now i never knew they were that that big huh 
kind of kind of nothing i wo n't have anything to do with 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
well it was nice talking to you 
well it certainly was um 
maybe you can get 
how many 
have you had very many of these calls 
um yeah 
almost everyday 
how wonderful 
yeah 
almost almost every single day from when they started it 
yeah 
how wonderful maybe i 'll be so lucky 
okay 
i enjoyed talking to you 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
well i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows and they kind of are in different spectrums i think um 
okay 
one of them 's quantum leap and the other one is night court 
okay 
and i think i think they 're real different i mean 
i do n't think they have anything in common 
uh quantum leap has i mean quantum leap is kind of a comedy in its own way i guess 
but uh mostly it 's it 's kind of science fiction 
and it 's um adventure and things like that um and then night court is just pure you know weird fun you know 
um-hum 
just it 's it 's nothing serious about it at all 
so i do n't know why the two of them happen to be my two favorite shows 
but they that 's the way it is 
so 
it 's funny that those are my two hu- my husband 's two favorite shows too 
and i enjoy both watching both of them 
but i used to did n't like night court and i 
um-hum 
and the only reason i think i like it now is because i 've seen it so much 
now i 'm involved with the characters 
but i used to think um dan fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me 
yeah he is 
and and i told my husband that 's the whole point 
but i i just 
yeah 
that 's right 
i mean 
it 's 
i find him degrading at times 
and i guess that is the point 
but sometimes it just 
well they they really have changed him though 
if if you 've watched it this season um he 's becoming i mean he still is in his own way degrading and everything 
but uh he 's involved in that charity 
and uh it 's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has 
in fact there was one show that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff 
oh 
and he you know was too depressed you know to 
so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever 
but 
um-hum i i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character 
i have n't watched um i think uh yeah 
which of course he needed 
i think so 
which in quantum leap you get 
even though the the person is involved in so many other people 's lives you still see a a real person in those situations 
he gets um he 's doing amazing things but he 's doing them within the bounds of what of normal person would do and i think that 's 
um-hum 
right 
right 
that 's that 's good point 
i like that 
so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows 
um i think my favorite show is hunter 
though okay 
and i i like the old ser- series better when um deedee was in there 
deedee 
yes and um so uh and then the the blonde that they took out the one that got killed yeah 
yeah 
i agree 
yeah 
i can n't remember what her name is 
but uh 
i did n't enjoy her 
i i 
she was too much of a opposite of deedee 
and i think that 's what they try to do 
but i think we wanted to see deedee there or somebody like her 
um-hum 
well but see i read an article about uh in tv guide about uh about hunter and about his l- you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them and they say that uh that there was abso- that there was like a a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use 
uh-huh 
i mean you know uh yeah 
the second lady 
the second one the blonde uh you know if you think about it they did n't really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners 
uh-huh 
yeah 
they did n't 
yeah 
she would go her way 
and he would do his 
yeah 
and i think that 's what i did n't like 
a- uh and and even even at the beginning deedee and and hunter would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would do would go this 
but uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations you know 
and um-hum 
like like hunter was the boss 
and and this other girl was not 
and you know you kind of you 're wondering you know well when did this happen 
right 
you know so yeah 
i i i kind of agree with that 
and i like the new lady better 
but i 'd just as soon that they did n't have the romance there 
i 'd just as soon have the the police story without all the romance 
well i 'm afraid that 's what they they really wanted to do um 
yeah 
i think most shows were doing that 
and then they went away from it and now they 're starting to go back to it 
um-hum 
and maybe that 's what the public wants 
i do n't know 
but i just i like the the cut and dry solve the mystery 
and that 's what i always enjoyed about it 
yeah 
well see there was that spark between deedee and hunter for a while but they they like started it 
yeah 
and then they 'd pull it back 
and they 'd start it and pull it back 
and that really made it a very interesting uh show to where you never really knew which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they 're going to be real close or whether they 're just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good 
um-hum 
but um you know it 's i- i guess you know 
you always kind of sit there 
and you see these two people together 
and you always wonder why they do n't you know get together or whatever 
yeah 
and so i guess that 's what they decide to do yeah 
just go ahead and quit the wondering 
and and 
but it 's it 's always been a formula uh for tv that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married that the show ends up w- you know dying 
yeah 
a a good example of this and uh you know this is uh probab- 
well maybe it 's not a good example 
i 've been watching nickelodeon all last week uh because they had uh what they called maximum smart 
they had get smart for uh ten hours a day from seven oclock at night -til six or -til five oclock the next morning all the get smart episodes you could ever see 
well the the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married and that was i mean that was the killer 
uh-huh 
the series died right after that because 
oh um-hum yeah i did n't i was going to say i did n't ever watch moonlighting 
well go ahead 
but i heard that 's what killed it that that uh interplay died when they got married 
um-hum 
the same thing 
and so the show died 
yeah 
the 
i- i- it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know 
um-hum 
the minute they get married everything 's supposed to be cut and dried 
and and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the character 's uh uh personalities um um well especially after they get married 
right 
halfway through 
yeah 
um couple of examples would be um well like i said this one about uh max or get well smart uh the female character uh barbara feldon she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who ev- always solved the things and and figured out and kept max from getting real messed up 
yeah um-hum 
well tow- whenever they got married she got dingy 
oh 
you know why would they do that 
yeah 
it it made no sense 
i i 'm guess it 's go- falling back into our traditional stereotypes which a lot of shows yeah 
yeah unfortunately that 's probably true 
which kind of 
like in the big soap opera shows which i do n't enjoy because of that 
but 
um-hum well do you watch um what is that show uh who 's the boss 
it 's uh that 's on tuesday nights i think 
i 've seen it before 
but i do n't watch it regularly 
yeah 
the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it 
usually tuesday nights i 'm out 
so 
but uh as as i 've seen it they 've they 've done sort of the same thing to where they 've they started to let them get together 
and then they pulled them apart and i think they 're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them uh get together then you lose part of what the show 's all about 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so i always thought that was kind of weird 
yeah 
it 's funny how we uh we we romanticize people uh like w- for instance when i was a teenager you know you romance uh romanticize a rock star 
um-hum 
but when he gets married then you do n't care anymore or something like that 
hum right 
and i think it 's the same with your characters on tv 
well do you think that 's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages a secret or at least they keep it quiet 
probably 
yeah i know it affected me when i was younger 
yeah i mean 
i 'm not into rock stars too much lately 
yeah 
but 
now 
like madonna and sean penn 
now i do n't particularly like either one of them but um uh their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together uh or at least that 's the way i look at it 
um-hum 
yeah 
um-hum it would have been hard 
so i do n't know 
would n't it 
yeah 
i would think so 
i i just the the publicity in and of itself much less the i mean 
when you get married you 've got relationship to develop in the first place 
so having twenty million people watch you do that 
um-hum yeah 
it 's 
it would n't be easy 
yeah 
so hum well that 's kind of interesting 
yeah 
so um well i gue- i guess that 's about all we need to do is n't it 
yeah 
i think we 've covered our time 
it 's been good talking to you 
yeah 
it has becky 
i really appreciate it 
oh you 're the first man i 've talked to 
everybody else has been a female 
so this is a change 
well i think i 've um 
you 're the second female i 've talked to 
you 've had a little bit of variety huh 
yeah 
it 's it 's kind of nice 
okay 
well thanks so much 
so uh-huh 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay um 
so uh um uh do you have any favorite teams 
and i guess well i kind of like them all 
i played for about eighteen years a- all the way through college and then uh kind of hung them up after college 
but 
oh i was going to say you played pro ball 
no 
not quite 
not quite huh 
made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball 
but anyway uh being in rochester you probably like the mets 
well 
that 's pretty good yes 
i 'm actually a met 's 
fan i 'm i 'm one of these people who 's actually a die hard met fan and an avid yankee hater 
oh boy it the i think it 's like one or the other is n't it 
i mean 
yeah 
it 's it 's 
i i i find it very strange 
um more people you know 
real met fans do n't like the yankees 
and real yankee fans do n't like the mets for some reason 
you either yeah 
i never fou- i never quite found a new york fan 
i 've always found a fan you know of of either one or the other 
and so that of course means that when it comes to the american league my favorite team is the red sox by default because i went to college also in boston 
oh okay 
i see 
yeah 
i i like the uh 
uh 
i guess if i had to pick a favorite team i 'd i anymore uh well as 
i kind of grew up rooting for philadelphia 
oh 
i 'm from new jersey originally 
yeah 
so that that 's sort of close enough 
yeah 
well we were thirty miles south of them 
so 
oh so you were pretty close 
right yeah 
right down the river 
but uh so what are the mets going to do this year without strawberry 
well i do n't know 
um there 's there 's a part of me that says that you know i 'm i 'm sort of glad strawberry went away 
you know when when he sort of went away i started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well 
but he really was n't worth the baggage you know 
yeah 
um i think they 're okay 
i think they 're you know 
i think they have enough people who are who are who are still in their prime you know 
um-hum 
um i mean certainly if you look at them compared to let 's say you know um just eight years ago or something they 're they 're they 're they 're you know they 're sort of in in good standing whereas you know um i think i certainly do n't think that they 're the eighty six team anymore 
yeah 
uh well i was going to talk to you about that eighty six team 
yeah 
i 
that was that was the year that uh they beat houston in uh extra innings right 
right 
that was year they beat houston in extra innings 
and then and then they actually won the series by by sort of a sneaky route um against boston when there was the ball that was sort of hit to buck- to buckner 
yeah 
i felt real bad about that 
but hey what can you do 
yeah yeah hey the guy 's making millions 
he ought to be able to perform right 
that 's right 
well actually he he he was supposedly um 
there was there was something wrong with him at the time 
and i 
well his knees were bothering him 
yeah 
right 
and i and i understand that 
and i say hey if the guy can n't play you do n't blame the team that 
uh hit it to him 
you blame the team you know for putting him in 
yeah 
for having him out there 
that 's right 
so 
sure 
so i i i was uh i was also i was in school at boston at the time 
oh oh boy 
so i 
it was actually wonderful because where i was there were half met fans and um half sox fans 
yeah 
i think we were all pretty much uh astros fans in the in the n- national league championship series but there 's like two fellows from uh brooklyn 
oh 
and they they were you know they were they were pretty much without having to say it they were pretty much mets fans 
yeah 
yeah 
well i guess they were uh i guess they must have been scared after the uh 
no 
not really 
they they were they were pretty much thugs 
they were n't scared of very much you know 
well that 's good 
well yeah brooklyn boys i guess 
yeah 
you do n't expect them to be uh much of anything but thugs 
no i know 
i was born there 
um 
yeah really 
yeah 
so i i wa- i was also born in brooklyn 
so i so i can call myself a brooklyn thug although i 'm really not 
okay 
okay 
well i 'm not to say that all folks from brooklyn are thugs 
but these two were definitely thugs 
and they were from brooklyn 
so i 'm kind of hoping 
i i i guess uh anymore i pretty much pull for the rangers though 
they were uh they 're they 're they 're they they have the i think they have the best facilities in the major leagues 
yeah 
i love going to watch a game in arlington stadium 
it 's great 
well that that 's 
actually i think that makes something because i think 
and and and as much as sort of fan support helps 
yeah 
you know it 's good to have um 
the only problem is it 's not large enough 
it only holds about 
i think they s- when ryan struck out his five thousandth player they they squeezed about forty thousand people in there 
yes 
it is kind of small 
yeah 
so they 're they 're they have plans 
i mean the the owner tried to move them to florida but uh they ended up sticking around in arlington 
right 
and they 're going to build a new stadium in arlington as a matter of fact not even in dallas 
oh that 's oh that 's great 
so 
so that 's that 's something that we 're looking forward to 
yeah 
that 'll be nice 
i mean that that i think tends to just keep 
i think stadiums have worked tend to keep people happy 
oh y- case in point toronto 
and yeah 
exactly 
yeah 
have you seen a game up there 
uh i have n't been to any toronto games yet 
but um 
oh boy i saw i 
i was up there on business uh last june and watched a game in the sky dome 
it was just phenomenal 
that 's that 's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think 
of stadiums 
yeah 
well i i mean to get up there 
i mean the the best i 've been up here so far you know up in in in up state new york is uh is um a rochester red wings game 
yeah uh-huh 
now i- is rochester 
where where is cornell university 
uh cornell is in ithaca 
ithaca 
uh yeah 
so cornell is about um somewhere uh about two and a half hours south of south and east of us 
okay 
so if you know where lake ontario is sort of 
yeah 
well rochester 's like right on the shores is n't it 
i- uh yeah 
we 're about ten miles south of lake ontario 
yeah 
okay 
actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually could n't be a port city 
okay 
um but that 
uh well they say that from that space needle up in toronto you can see the lights of rochester on a clear night 
oh really 
i ne- i had n't actually known that 
yeah 
well um but we have our own um our our own triple a team here the redwings which is the uh farm team for the orioles 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
so everybody hopes that uh they go all the way around here 
they 're the they 're the big team in rochester 
those games are fun to watch 
you you you watch those games 
oh i yeah 
i 
actually we we we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they 're fun 
yeah 
because they 're lots of really big you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know um 
and they 'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know um especially you know 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and i 'll um i 'll make a day game or something 
yeah 
but they really seem to um people really get into it 
i mean i i can n't i i again i can n't make any predictions about them 
but i suspect they 'll go uh they 'll go far 
yeah 
we used to like watching 
my my folks lived down in beaumont 
and uh o- on the campus of lamar university they used to house the the beaumont golden gators who were a double a team for the padres i think 
but uh they they were fun games to watch 
yeah 
tho- those are those are always the i i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes 
someti- 
well there 's definitely a lot more hitting 
yes 
it 's true 
well it 's one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are uh uh you know 
yeah 
i g- i guess when you start pitching real well well move them up 
bam 
yeah 
you know there goes the little the uh worst team yeah 
but um 
so as far as the major league teams i do n't know 
i- the rangers have been y- you know 
every year they they always knock on a door early and then just go into their skid about you know the end of june 
but they they 've got so much young raw talent it 's just amazing 
and then they just have n't been able to put anything together 
so what uh well the way i the way i see it is 
i mean um you know i i can use a met analogy here 
um-hum 
if you 'll think back a few years to when the mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but were n't very sort of well trained you know back to the you know maybe eighty um eighty four or or eighty three or or eighty five you know when they were first when they were n't quite the eighty six team that that that they were 
yeah 
um-hum 
right 
um i that 
that probably gives the readers a good shot for you know this year or next year i think it you know the young talent really sort of has to build itself up 
yeah 
i mean they 've been they 've been young for a while 
and they 're alm- almost starting to age a little bit here 
i just um 
yeah 
they they 're they 're really hurting pitching wise 
i mean they 've got ryan 
but you know who knows what he 'll be able to do 
he 's been 
last year he started having some nagging injuries 
and but it 'll it 'll be interesting to watch 
right 
but 
i hope to get up there 
we we usually try to get to opening day game 
there 's several guys from our church try to go up there 
that that 's if i- oh that must be nice 
yeah 
well i i guess we 're probably oh maybe a hundred fifty miles south of dallas 
well see that is n't too bad 
a couple hours 
no 
not too bad 
about it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there 
yeah 
well it 'd take me a good seven hours to get to shay stadium 
so so i do n't know 
that 's probably because of the roads 
you just do n't yeah 
we we 've just got a freeway 
we just get right on the freeway and just go north 
i do n't yeah 
well actually we can we can i can take a highway the whole way down 
but it 's still it 's um it 's it 's almost four hundred hour- 
well it 's so crowded up there 
i mean i mean it it 's almost four hundred you know 
barring traffic it 's four hundred hours i mean i mean four hundred mi- four hundred hours right four hundred miles barring traffic 
golly 
so it 's um it it 's uh you know it 's it 's a heck of a drive 
we are substantially north of new york enough that uh we do n't get to go play too often 
yeah 
um 
well i 
do n't know you 're you 're you 're like a boat ride from 
h- how far is it across the lake to canada 
toronto 
toronto 
oh toronto 's only about two hours 
yeah 
yeah 
toronto i mean i i want to go see 
you do you drive there 
or do you take the ferry or what 
um i can 
i 've actually i 've driven 
but i 've heard about the ferry as well 
yeah 
have n't taken it yet though 
have you taken it 
yeah 
it 's a it 's a beautiful city 
yeah um 
i i really love 
i i think that 's one of the most uh enjoyable things about being up here 
i 'm only up here for school 
i really like it um-hum 
so and then and then you go back to new york after school 
so i uh no 
probably south maybe texas 
or new york city oh really 
actually some place south and warm 
i do n't 
i 'm not a w- i 'm not a big uh i 'm not a big uh cold fan 
well what what kind of weather are you having right now 
uh right now we 're actually having uh 
it 's getting nice 
i mean it was in the high fifties today 
but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm 
oh boy 
yeah 
we 've been up in the oh seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple weeks ago 
oh that 's great 
yeah well about that same time branches were falling off everywhere 
and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks 
already we 're it 's golly 
because of the ice 
okay it did n't make the na- na- na- national news too much which i find really weird but um we were 
hum 
i mean um you know all schools were closed for almost for for over or for for a week 
golly 
there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive 
huh illegal 
yeah 
because they had so many power lines down and so many uh and so many things like that 
oh yeah 
so they were 
okay 
well personally i do n't have any children 
i 'm twenty two 
and i 'm doing my master 's at nc state so uh uh children would n't be very convenient for me right now 
oh uh-huh 
well no 
they would n't would they 
no 
so what what how do you spend the time with your children 
well both of mine are boys 
they 're eight and eleven and we 're into sports i mean as a matter of fact that 's what we 're doing tonight 
oh 
okay 
and they 
yeah 
what what are you doing 
uh baseball has started 
oh okay 
do do they play like uh like does the eight year old play baseball 
oh oh yes 
we start here at uh five 
okay 
and and in in in his league do they have like a pitcher 
or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what 
up until 
it 's coach pitch until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in may 
okay 
so he 's going to be with uh regular pitching and my eleven year old of course you know is pitching 
oh okay 
yeah 
i i used to play soccer when i was that age up in new york 
uh-huh 
so 
but yes 
we 're into baseball 
and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball 
we even have peewee basketball here 
so there 's always something 
yeah 
and how about how about like on the weekends 
do you do sports 
or do you go out 
both 
if we 're not doing sports we go somewhere 
do you go uh how about like for uh do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
in the summer or like in the easter time like around now 
no 
usually in the summer time 
and where do you go 
different places every year 
we 
have have you been out of the country 
no 
oh okay 
well first they always say get to know your country first before you leave 
i mean i i lived in places like 
uh-huh 
when i lived in washington uh washington dc i never went to the washington memorial 
and then when i went back to visit i went to the washington memorial 
you know i 've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to washington quite often 
and that must be the thing 
they really had n't either 
they went to the memorial you know 
because when they go it 's on business it 's not really just to getting to sight see 
right 
right 
well it 's it 's a beautiful city 
oh i bet it is too 
and but the problem is like first example when i was young they they took me to las vegas and that was the most boring place on earth 
uh-huh 
oh now my husband and i we go different places 
but our child- but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close 
yeah 
did uh did like did you go to disneyland 
oh yes 
yes 
yes 
oh okay 
so but um now i do n't know 
but um but let 's see 
when i was eleven i went also to the caribbean 
oh 
that that was fun that was 
and uh then after that i 
my sister lives in turkey 
so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to turkey 
oh 
and this christmas i went to turkey 
but basically it 's uh 
for the past couple of years uh i 
since my parents are are well 
i 'm from argentina 
and my parents live down there 
so all the traveling i do is alone 
uh-huh 
and uh we were never much of 
uh a very uh family thing you know may like go skiing in vermont or something 
uh-huh 
that was uh that was a lot of fun 
yes 
but what happens is we used to fight a lot 
so there 's never much of a family family thing 
you know one of those hell family vacations 
yeah yes oh yes 
but we try you know uh i try 
my husband also we 're involved in everything our kids does because uh my dad died you know when i was less than a year old so i always just had a mother 
yeah 
yeah 
so i always thought when i have kids you know i really want to be involved with them 
well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us 
so he could buy us material things 
uh-huh things 
yes 
that is 
yes 
and and and to me you know it 's like now i 'm twenty two 
but i still feel you know 
it 's like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way i was brought up 
uh-huh 
and he wants me now 
he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and it 's very hard for me 
best friends now 
because you know it 's like you grow up to be twenty years old 
and it 's always the same man and then suddenly he sees that he 's getting old 
yes uh-huh 
and he wants to be best friends but uh you know it 's like i can only express myself so much 
yeah 
because you know of everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say i 'm sorry you know 
it 's like you know i love you 
and let 's go out and do things together when i do n't feel like it you know and so that 's uh that the sa- thing that you know its like when like like 
uh-huh 
i 've seen my uncle and his family you know does everything together 
and you know his kids are you know 
when his little girl was five years old and everything they uh they would go to the beach 
and she could go to sleep at two in the morning you know and uh i was brought up the same way 
um-hum yeah oh uh-huh 
yeah 
if if it does n't matter what age you have 
if just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know 
yes uh-huh 
but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his his work from his house 
yeah 
yeah you have to i mean you honestly do 
yeah 
now i have friends that i love to death 
but and they have children 
but their children does anything 
we have to take them and you know to do it 
yeah 
and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while 
because you 're saying well i work full time too you know 
yeah 
yeah 
but uh it 's just it 's just something that you know 
my theory is you know when when you have kids and all you want to do well 
what i 'll do is you know it like 
i mean you might have a problems 
but it 's not your kids problems you know 
yeah 
oh yeah 
and you got to try to to be with them as much as you can 
and to you know like 
thing is is that you know like if if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem you know 
uh-huh problem 
uh-huh 
and uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time you know 
yeah 
first of all you 're coming to me 
and let 's see how we can get rid of the problem you know 
and that 's uh that 's very that 's very hard to do 
because once you 're best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better 
yeah yeah yeah uh-huh 
yeah 
uh i agree with you very much so 
now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college 
and we knew time wise or and money wise too would it would not have been a good idea to had them then 
yeah 
yeah 
my my father was raising four ki- oh well three kids before he had me 
so it was uh you know 
you 're trying to support uh four kids 
and it 's pretty hard you know 
yes 
and i and i told them listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids 
uh-huh 
yeah 
he goes yeah 
but then i would n't have you 
i go yeah 
but then you would have a lot of money 
that 's right 
but you can n't take this money with us though that 's how i keep looking at it 
you know yeah 
but you know like four i mean four four children is expensive especially when you consider like especially for for me which i 'm paying out of state tuition 
i 'm paying you know three thousand 
no 
what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester 
oh 
and uh you know people say you know it 's expensive for to send kids to college 
but if if an everybody would be a little bit responsible you know 
it 's like 
what what does it cost 
it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose 
that they go to a state college 
and they live at home you know 
yes yeah uh-huh oh uh-huh 
and well it costs two hundred dollars for books 
but you know seven hundred dollars a semester 
a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead you know like i mean it 's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college you know 
oh yeah 
if you can- if you can 
yeah 
yeah 
what are you wanting to be 
oh oh excuse me 
what degree i mean what are you wanting to do after you get out of college 
well i i 'm doing computer science computer engineering 
oh th- that 's 
my husband 's into uh computers 
yeah 
and and now i 'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home because since i 'm an international student they want to send me back to argentina 
uh-huh 
yeah 
well my dad wants me to go back 
so 
and you do n't want to 
no 
no 
no 
no 
because if you go back there then you can never get out 
oh 
like you do n't have any money to to get out 
uh-huh 
so uh and uh i was thinking you know like oh my god you know i go back there 
and then and then i might get married there 
and then i will have kids there 
and then i 'll never leave the place you know 
hum then you 'll never leave 
yeah 
i know 
and that 's that 's what happened to my brother 
he came to school up here 
and then when he went down there 
he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain 
yeah oh oh 
uh-huh 
so 
well maybe something will open up for you 
yeah 
i i 've been calling a lot of companies 
there 
some of them are interested 
well at least for a year and a half i can work 
uh-huh 
so 
well may- 
well i 've enjoyed talking to you 
i 'll do it all right 
same here 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
so i guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work or do you or do you like to do it 
yeah 
well i um 
about a or just over a year ago i bought my my own house 
so this has been the first opportunity i 've had to uh be working on my own lawn and garden 
and uh you know and back when i was a kid you know mom would send me out to weed the garden 
i i 'd hate it you know 
yeah 
now i sort of take pride in uh in the yard and you know how the how the place looks 
and uh so i do n't mind doing it so much anymore 
yeah 
so do you have a do you have a garden 
or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn 
well it 's yeah it 's it 's primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit 
you know i 've got some uh bushes around the fou- you know the foundation planting things like that 
and then there 's some uh uh just some little flowerbeds 
and my mom grows 
she 's an avid gardener 
and she starts her own stuff from seed now 
and uh she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the winter time and and starting them 
uh she ends up with so many plants that she can n't fit them all in her garden 
they have a huge yard and a huge house 
and so she brings them up here from philadelphia and gives me all her extras 
well that 's pretty good 
yeah 
my my sister is very over zealous too 
she 's got some really nice flowerbeds 
she puts a lot of time into them 
this is my first year in a in a house where i thinking about doing some flowerbeds and stuff 
oh we i 've always had crude ones at my father 's 
but this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house 
yeah 
his house is more like a farmhouse 
its not on a main road 
uh-huh 
my house is on a main road 
and it has nothing 
yeah 
i mean nothing 
but uh what i do do is now i 've always done it is 
at my father 's house we have my sister and i have a couple of gardens 
i think we figured out total um this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre 
uh-huh 
so we each have a third of an acre we do 
geez 
that 's a that 's more than that 's more than than the property i have right here that you 've got as a uh a garden 
that 's a lot 
that 's amazing 
yeah 
well it 's my dad 's 
and we 've had it for ov- he 's been there for a long time so um it just happens they built a shopping center next to it but um they put up a nice fence 
right 
oh geez 
so we still have a lot of privacy 
and we grow a lot of food 
uh-huh 
uh i enjoy it 
um the gardens are kind of old 
you have to step down in them now that the and we 've tilled them so much 
uh-huh 
but they 're still 
we we my sister uses plenty of fertilizer 
i do n't know if that 's a good thing or a bad thing 
boy i wish this phone would stop screeching 
are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line 
yes 
i 'm trying 
i do n't know if it 's my phone 
this is bad 
it 's not getting any better 
yeah 
i can n't even hear what you 're 
oh okay 
geez 
it 's gone 
i do n't see i do n't think my phone really does that 
but every time i have this phone is a little weird 
i mean it 's been dropped on the floor a hundred times 
well i- i do n't know 
there was 
well whatever it was i- i c- there was a second there 
i could n't even hear what you were saying 
but um 
yeah 
i was beating on the phone going 
can you hear me 
yeah 
i guess i was having a hard time there too 
i thought it sounded 
well guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh uh doing this work 
so yeah 
but um 
yeah 
i mean that 's a uh heck of a plot 
you must have uh a lot of different stuff you get out of it 
especially up in vermont there you should have uh some really nice soil 
yeah 
we we grow a lot of um the basic c- corn potatoes 
uh-huh 
she likes to really get into her pumpkins 
and see how many she can grow ba- corn potatoes 
and uh acorn squash are good winter keepers 
yeah 
i mean things the way we grow are carrots and uh cabbage that sort of more less goes to waste you know we eat it we 
um-hum 
just too much 
she she starts her own plants 
she plants a lot of tomatoes i let her do a lot of the planting and putting 
uh-huh 
and i- i do a lot of the uh a lot of the the ba- the back work and stuff 
but she does she helps me a lot too 
uh-huh 
she puts a lot of financial 
she plans it all out 
beans like to be near certain types of plants 
now they they find that tomatoes do n't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas 
i do n't know 
something 
oh really 
is because of like the cross pollination 
or 
no 
it 's just they do n't like you to something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you 're not supposed to put your onions near your beans 
i guess it 's it it 's just what scents it gives off 
they just do n't like each other 
huh 
i mean she she reads all kinds of books 
so i wish i knew more to tell you why 
but 
what huh my mom uh put uh cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once 
and they got cross pollinated by the bees and we ended up with these these like things on the cantaloupe vines that i mean were looked like round big huge round cucumbers 
they yeah 
oh that 's really weird 
and and yeah 
i mean there these were like some mutant 
i will put i 've put my uh cucumbers are down at one end of the garden 
and like like i 'll make an l shape i 've put cantaloupe 
so they 've been pretty close together 
huh 
but i do n't think the vines 
have they do n't really they do n't have to be touching or anything 
like you say they cross pollinate just by bees 
no 
it 's just the like the bees and insects will do it 
oh 
um either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something 
i know some something weird 
yeah 
this year we did n't this last season it was it was too wet up here we lost a lot of oh uh root things our oh uh our squash and our potatoes 
uh-huh 
and we got half our yield 
oh well 
was really bad because of the water 
yeah 
when i 
uh my family used to live in littleton massachusetts 
and when we moved in there we had a uh really wet backyard 
and uh my mom wanted a vegetable garden 
so we trucked in uh 
i think it was seven what was it cubic seven yards cubic yards 
i think that 's how they measure dirt but yeah 
y- yeah 
seven yards of sand 
i got to shovel it all lots of fun 
yeah 
i- i have to do that 
i want to make some flowerbeds 
and i 'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some topsoil 
uh-huh 
and i 'm going to 
a my problem is i want to use those railroad ties to build up a planter but i do n't know if the creosote in the railroad ties is going to do something to uh you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there i- i mean i guess it 'd go for my flowers 
sure 
right 
well it seems 
i 've seen a lot of people use them you know for flowerbeds 
but i do n't know what whether they 'd have creosote would do anything 
i mean 
but yeah 
i do n't i do n't i just do n't think you 
i always thought i 'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i do n't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering 
um-hum 
and i do n't know if they make landscape ties that are n't treated 
well you can get um you can get pressurized lumber 
yeah 
but they put some kind of chemicals in there too 
oh that 's right 
there 's even there 's bad chemicals in those too 
yeah 
well i 'm not really worried about it 
it 's mainly for flower bed 
so i 'm not going to not go- i 'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there 
alright 
but i 
yeah 
i do want to have a raised bed 
i 've never 
i my flower gardens have always been like on the ground 
right 
they do n't it just looks so much better when it 's up against the house tiered up 
well it 's not that you can see it a little better 
and it stands out 
yeah 
this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch 
and i can tell you there 's nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush 
there was a lilac tree 
and the landlord cut it down and said yep that 's one thing you have to do summer keep that lilac bush cut down so it does n't rub up against the siding and i 'm looking at him like jeez 
oh geez yeah 
people would kill to have a lilac bush and he 's cutting it down 
so that 's all right 
flower beds are all right 
anything as long as it does n't rub up against the siding 
rub up against the siding uh 
yep 
that 's what he 's worried about the trees or a bush because lilac bushes they they grow fast 
some people uh would really like to have them 
and then the people that do have them they spread and they sprout all over th- their lawn 
um-hum 
so they 're kind of a pain 
but you know people who do n't have them think they 're great 
and people who do have them cur- curse 
right right 
another thing i have that um is weird is these a locus tree in the backyard 
as a matter of fact there 's three of them very badly trimmed 
they are n't trimmed at all 
uh-huh 
and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we 'd do if if the trees hang down 
so low and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it 
yeah 
because it like 
i- i think i 've seen those before 
but i do n't remember what they look like 
so they 're a pretty tree 
but you just when you walk up to them they 're covered with thorns 
so we 're going to get a chain saw and we 're going to limb limb it extensively so it the trees up overhead 
give you room to get under it 
sure 
yeah 
because i can just see brushing up against it that it would rip your skin 
yeah 
it 's worse than a r- a rose bush 
hm 
many times worse because of course it 's a tree 
oh a chainsaw is always something very nice to have 
yep 
my uh dad used to work on them 
so i do n't think i 'll have a problem 
my husband will have problem borrowing one 
then you got to get him to 
if he 's going to do it you 've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it 
even well if that 's not the problem it 
okay 
well like i was saying burlington 's crime it does n't involve children 
and what you see on the tv 's from you know in washington and new york 
so what i believe the people want 
the subject is is big city crime which is something that i do n't have any first hand experiences about 
but i have you know concerns 
and i have a few ideas of um how to combat it 
um-hum 
i mean i do n't i do n't think uh ideally you know you need money to do everything 
so that 's one thing 
um-hum 
that that 's one thing that that 's that 's crime that you can n't fight it if you need that money 
so 
right 
yeah 
well when uh we lived in san antonio 
i grew up around san antonio 
and it 's always been a very large uh city and increasingly growing 
it 's has kind of the split population 
um there 's a lot of retired military uh individuals that live there 
and then there 's a very large hispanic population there 
and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is hispanic uh gang crime in the city and that is uh been the worse thing that we 've seen happening 
oh 
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the uh retired people 's community 
or does it stay in the bad neighborhood 
uh um the majority of the actual gang crimes like the the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods 
but the crime spreads out into the more affluent uh divisions through robberies rape and uh car crime 
there 's a very large uh or very high percentage of car theft 
and san an- san antonio 's not far from the border to mexico 
so a a lot of the uh cars go to uh you know hack shops 
and they take them apart 
and a lot of them go over the border especially like mercedes 
a lot of those those in the the z uh the z cars the datsun cars end up over the border 
and uh very much so 
so that 's a big concern if you live there is to really lock your car up 
very much so 
in fact um for a while there uh they had downtown if you were to co- come to a stop light they had a a rash of where people were uh when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up 
so now uh ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they 're in the car until they get down there 
and uh once you 've reached the the river walk area which is the tourist area it 's usually pretty safe during th- during the day if you 're just kind of cautious and do n't go down the back streets or alleys and um you know or or alone 
if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have th- the river patrol cops it 's very nice 
but at at evening um again you they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice 
but you do n't want to get off the beaten track 
um there 's a lot of parking garages there because um parking is very tight 
and so you do n't want to get caught in the parking garage um alone 
oh my it sounds like um san juan puerto rico 
we were there just well for a lay over and um well it was n't a lay over 
um-hum 
we were some we had we were staying at the other end the island 
we drove into san juan to catch our plane 
um-hum 
it was at night 
and this boy really wanted to go on the beach 
and they look at you crazy you do n't go on the beach 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i says well it 's a big tourist town you know 
do n't they do n't people go for a walk on the beach at night 
and they said no 
it 's very safe in the daytime but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach 
um-hum 
it 's just so sad you know 
it is just really so sad because you can n't enjoy anything any more 
um in san antonio i do n't know what the answer is 
uh education i think is a lot of it 
um so many of the kids are are drop outs 
um uh they ha- there 's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives 
they they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels 
i think education helps a little bit there 
um they again i do n't know really what steps there are that they 
well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young 
uh-huh 
and what we have here in burlington which it does n't cost a lot of money but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
they set up kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow 
they have a big brother big sister program 
uh 
they have bottle drives 
they have cleanup outings 
and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer 
and they have gyms open 
and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school you might keep them but you again you need that one on one like a big brother trying to keep the the younger kid you know tell him hey stay in school 
uh-huh 
it 'll get better you know 
so that your mom does n't have a job and and she does n't wor- 
uh-huh 
you do n't know 
you can be better than that 
you do n't have to live on the you know the for a street life 
uh-huh 
but 
uh-huh 
that 's good that sounds like they 've got a lot going on there 
yeah 
but it 's so cheap they do n't have a problem here 
i mean um they can deal with that scale 
uh-huh 
they might have five hundred troubled youths 
uh-huh 
when you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you 're getting into th- well the kids now they 're so it 's twelve years old 
and they 're selling drugs and they 've got a fifteen year old that 's their boss that is carrying a gun 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
it 's just it 's the morals of the people which i mean i guess we everybody 's responsible for the society 
but if i had a child that that that did things so bad 
it 's not they do n't care about anybody these people they 're stealing from they 're just the big bad rich guy and we do n't have it 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
so we deserve it 
and we should take it 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i do n't know how you combat that 
i i do n't know where you start or with a lot of these kids 
um so many of them all they see is just the gangs and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they do n't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school 
yeah 
well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too 
we 're talking these kids are fourteen years old 
oh yeah 
the parents might be thirty years old and i 'm thirty years old 
uh-huh 
and i 'm kind of irresponsible 
but i have the morals that keep me from you know 
if i was going to go out and drink or do something i would n't do it in front of my child 
these people you know they bring their their johns home 
and they bring their drugs home 
and the kids are just sitting there in the same room 
uh-huh 
it 's ju- just that they have absolutely no no morals and it 's really sad 
uh-huh 
and i do n't know how you combat that 
i rea- 
i do n't know what the answer is to that problem you know 
but i like your idea of education if the parents are n't supplying it they 've got to get it from someone else from the schools 
i- i do- uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and what do those kids do 
they get it at school and come home 
what do they do then 
i i feel i feel for them 
i do n't know how to make it better for them 
or you know unless because it they can n't remove themselves 
they can n't just leave and say okay well it 's not acceptable 
i 'm leaving the big city mom 
and i 'm i 'm going off you know 
when they 're ten they have to live in it 
and uh-huh 
yeah 
it 's really sad 
like if they did have a big brother big sister program those those people trying to help the kids 
the parents might have hostilities towards them you know like you 're judging us 
right 
i think so 
and uh 
and i 'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true it it it 's 
uh-huh 
i 'm glad i do n't live in a big city just because i mean not just because i would n't feel safe 
uh-huh 
yeah 
it 's just because that i would be reminded every day of something that i do n't see 
yeah 
and i might see it on a you know a a sixty minute special 
uh-huh 
no 
in san antonio it was like every day 
it was just a matter of who was shot that night 
i know it 
but san antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not 
i mean they have all kinds of nice write ups about it but any big city has a bad section 
uh-huh 
oh yeah 
but um-hum but there 's a lot of them 
it 's very prevalent 
a lot of the the crime is very prevalent 
yes 
they 're very bold it seems 
uh-huh 
very much 
when we moved here to monterrey it was a big change because it 's such a small community 
we 're just above carmel 
and um there 's hardly 
most everybody seems pretty well employed around here 
and um those that are n't 
there 's celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers 
and there 's a lot of crime there um migrant hispanic farm workers uh people that are down and out 
and uh they all seem to congregate in celinas not so much here in monterrey 
so it 's it 's pretty quiet i 've bee- you know 
we walk the streets at night 
and uh people run in the park 
and you know you 're just 
have your normal smarts about you then you really do n't have to worry 
or 
really 
even uh even in the worst crime areas in burlington 
i i can walk the streets 
i would n't 
i if i did it every night i think there would be trouble in our house 
uh-huh 
so you would n't get confronted or anything but i do n't think you would uh 
right 
someone might grab you mess around with you 
but they 're not going to grab you steal you- your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities i mean that 's you you 're going to have to expect that to happen 
uh-huh 
yeah 
people are just totally unfeeling uh uh 
uh-huh oh well 
i did n't know that about burlington 
i 'll have to keep that in mind 
okay 
did you vote in the last uh national election 
yes 
we uh uh i have n't missed a one since i 've been eligible to vote 
oh that 's good 
uh did you get to vote at the last one 
i voted in the last national one 
yeah 
i 'm not sure 
if i got the last local one 
oh uh-huh 
yeah 
and sometimes the the local ones are n't as publicized it seems that uh they should be 
yeah 
and you 're not sure where to go and vote and all that 
right 
and uh there 's usually nobody running against you know the incumbents 
right 
or you do n't know what they sta- you know where they stand or anything like that 
right 
so uh but i i feel that uh a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting 
yeah 
i think you 're right 
and it 's it 's they 're 
and also they 're fed up with the system 
and they say well why should i even vote 
yeah 
or sometimes they do n't like either of the choices for the candidates 
right 
so they think well you know why vote 
right 
the lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it 
yeah 
really 
especially in texas 
oh i know it 
the last gubernatorial race was oh that was awful 
it really was 
yeah 
but uh so i do n't know 
i 
it 'll be interesting to see how the next uh few years go 
it was a mess yeah 
did you think it 's a serious problem that half the people do n't vote 
um yeah 
i think well it 's it 's definitely a problem 
and i think it could get worse 
or yeah 
you know we get this lackadaisical attitude 
and say huh you know why should we vote 
and then uh you know it could uh it could lead to some serious things 
yeah 
it also seems like maybe a- another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting 
um-hum 
right uh 
yeah 
we can get uh you know if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes if they were you know had enough pull 
yeah 
it 's kind of like in louisiana where that uh guy that 's like a ku klux klan member something got elected 
yes 
um-hum 
kind of scary when you think about that 
yeah 
and uh who 's the other guy larou- uh larouche la- uh that uh is sort of the uh socialist not socialist but co- 
uh uh he 's so off the wall that uh he 's gone in and tried to get into city elections 
and uh but he 's got he 's been put away for uh credit card fraud i believe 
oh gosh 
yeah 
lyndon larouche that 's it 
yeah 
and uh 
so yeah 
yeah 
people 'll will sit home and assume oh that guy would never get elected 
um-hum 
next thing you know you 've got him 
right 
if you do n't go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will because a lot of the people like that they 'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say well you know this guy 's got everything together 
yeah 
you know i like what he says 
you know it 'll be so far off the wall that they 'll elect him 
right yeah 
and uh you know i think that 's sort of what happened with louisiana because because uh the guy did get elected correct 
yeah 
i think so right 
that 's what i thought 
yeah 
he sure did 
and uh so you know it uh but you know they can always fool us you know 
they might do a good job 
yeah 
i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or something like if you have if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long i think that discourages a lot of people 
um-hum oh yeah 
what we do usually is uh vote uh absenteeism and uh i know here you know you do n't have to have any reason 
uh-huh 
you can just go and vote and uh the polls are open what was it a couple of weeks 
right 
uh the hours are good 
and it they 're even open on saturdays and a couple of sundays 
uh-huh 
and so y- we 've got plenty of time to go uh because uh down here in in houston it 's uh the lines are long 
yeah 
i 'm in dallas 
and they 're long here too 
so uh but uh 
so yeah 
i voted absentee one year 
i really was going to be gone 
so i i did it 
but uh it was nice 
i would be tempted to do it again 
uh-huh well uh i recommend it because you just walk right on in and there 's usually not anybody in line and uh you know that vote 's just as good as you know the one on election day 
right 
yeah 
i think they should change the whole system so that it 's easier i thi- i think more people would do it if it was n't such a hassle 
um-hum 
yeah 
um i 've yeah 
i 've been involved with uh some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the of the republican party 
and it 's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the uh how the uh the not the ballots 
but uh my mind has gone blank 
i 've been wrestling with a child all evening 
uh w- uh how they develop uh what the candidate stands for the you know the views and uh you know everybody gets to vote on you know well should he be for this and uh you know on and on and on 
uh-huh 
and uh it 's it 's interesting 
uh-huh yeah 
that would be 
i usually vote 
a lot of times i 'll vote a straight party ticket just because i do n't take the time to find out what every you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on on what issues 
but huh um-hum 
so i just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so i 'll go ahead and vote 
uh right 
and uh there for a while that would that works 
we 've uh i i know i have uh 
i 'll stick to uh to uh you know sometimes i 'll stick to a certain party depends on the guy 
but that uh-huh 
but uh if it uh gets down between two then i 'll i 'll vote for the party if i know you know something about the other guy 
yeah 
or you know they 're both just as bad 
then i 'll say well i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party 
and um but 
yeah 
you know that 's not uh the best way 
but 
no 
i guess it 'd be best if you knew what each person and what they stood for and why and everything 
r- right but it gets to the point where 
i mean you 've got to have the ti- find the time also to r- read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for 
but right 
and try to determine if what you read was objective or not 
right 
or what you 've heard on tv which i think is just outrageous 
and yeah 
i i do n't agree with how the uh media handles elections 
yeah 
i you know i 'm i 'm tired of hearing about the polls you know you know 
this is how he stands such and such a day they break it out 
yeah 
it 's ju- it 's ju- ridiculous 
yeah 
i think it could affect the outcome you know could make it unfair 
um-hum 
it really could 
and uh uh then how sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an an issue into the ground which is good and dead 
and they keep dragging it on 
and it could hamper the uh outcome of an election for the guy that should have won 
oh yeah 
yeah 
so uh 
yeah 
the press has a lot of power 
they really do 
i i sometimes think that that should be limited more 
yeah 
oh but boy you try get into that 
you 'd really open a can of worms 
oh yes 
or they uh you know i i agree with the freedom of of the press and that 's you know all the amendments 
but sometimes it 's for the public 's own good that we do n't hear things 
yeah 
seems like they should regulate themselves a little bit 
and i do n't think they ever care to 
no 
they do n't 
well i can n't think of anything else really about the polls or voting to talk about 
and well i enjoyed talking to you 
well it was good talking to you 
all right 
um bye 
thank you bye-bye 
okay 
we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it 
okay 
well is your does your city have mandatory re- uh recycling 
no 
we do n't have mandatory 
we actually we 're kind of slow up here 
and we 've just started doing recycling probably last summer 
and it 's all voluntary 
so that 's interesting 
cities have a mandatory recycling 
um there there 's some places that are strongly encouraging it 
then that the city will pick it up 
that 's been one of the arguments here 
i 'm just sitting here looking 
we 've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff 
but we have to carry it um some distance 
and some places um you can sell your uh recyclables 
and um for example um our church was was collecting newspapers 
yeah 
wh- when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing 
we got like a penny a pound for them 
well it turns out that so much 
the problem in texas is that uh they 've got so much paper now from people recycling that they 've got no way to uh reprocess it 
oh my 
that it requires an ex- it requires uh essentially a paper mill to recycle it 
and so the value has gone down 
it turns out it was n't worth it for the church to do 
wow i did n't i did n't realize 
you would think 
now up here i- i suppose they send it all back to the mill 
and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of uh 
actually there is one in northern vermont 
so there 's probably a paper mill that 's sixty miles from here 
i did n't think that you know in the large city that if the next recycling if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it 's a lot of money to transport 
well 
yeah 
well see that 's 
in in dallas there there no plan to build 
i think that there 's some in east texas there 's some pulp mills 
but uh you have to go to houston 
and uh it 's interesting 
and then there 's places that 'll buy metal 
and they still buy aluminum can in fact that 
do you have to buy metal 
copper is a very uh good one to collect 
even aluminum 
yeah 
so 
well do you do do you do recycling 
uh we do do recycling 
and our city will pick up our recyclables 
oh 
they have these little blue bins 
um i do n't recycle personally 
i i 'm saying i want to do it 
but i do n't get a lot of magazines 
i do n't get a 
i do n't buy the newspaper 
but i do have a lot of uh 
my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of car- a lot of different papers and cardboards 
well do you do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans 
yes 
but we have a bottle return 
a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles 
we 've had five cent uh deposits on our bottles for years 
oh so it 's worth taking them back 
well see we do n't have 
we have we have 
most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles 
oh they should definitely get um the nickel returnable 
it 's great for the kids because see a lot of the kids get the money from it 
and it 's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes 
oh that 's in- 
you know 
that you know that there is a down side to all this you know about no good deed going unpunished that uh 
my mother sells um trees that they make paper out of 
and so every time i recycle newspapers uh in fact there 's uh there 's a uh 
kimberly and clark the the makers of kleenex and such has a uh a big uh paper mill 
yeah 
that fact i almost went to work for them 
i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me 
but it 's twenty or thirty miles from my house 
every time you recycle that 's one less tree my mother can sell 
and uh so it 's a question should i be diligent and um um and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood 
and recycle 
uh uh yeah 
i see that 
but it it it 's an interesting point though that uh you know everybody 's so anxious to recycle 
and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment 
but 
but it takes away employment from the resource 
that its 
uh well but in general i think it 's a good idea because there 's like the glass uh you can n't argue that the glass 
using i do too 
it does n't biodegrade 
and and uh the plastics obviously 
uh they do n't either 
they do n't so we might as well recycle those 
yeah 
like i say it 's not a very controversial thing 
everyone thinks we should do it 
it 's just that we 're so lazy 
i mean like personally i do n't want to clean my 
i just have can cat food 
i do n't want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin 
yeah 
you know i 'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash 
well that 's what we 've got 
ours we we started about 
new year 's we decided we 'd get ambitious 
we took one load over there 
and now we 've got these containers filling up with stuff 
and you know it it it 's not a very high priority thing to go haul these uh containers over there 
well 
i think i- i would be like when i bring my bottles back 
um if if if they 're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months 
and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them over and bring them over 
now if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if you said wash all the cans and things i would n't mind if it sat around too much 
but if if it stunk or something i would n't like doing it 
but um i produce quite a bit of trash my you know house 
and i see it 
but i do n't see so much that i can recycle 
yeah 
like i say it 's a lot of different type paper and cardboard 
i 'm not a real plastic person user 
but a lot of paper um pretty much 
and i and i do n't know how they sort that 
but if if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i wou- i would have a recycling center 
but now it 's just me and my husband 
so i do n't know 
but every little bit helps right 
yeah 
i know what you 're saying 
like well we have it at work we have a very aggressive recycling at work 
and i 'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin 
see some people the recycle bin is on their way out 
instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them at the end of the day they throw them in the trash 
w- well do you have separate trash cans at your desk 
um no 
we do n't 
but other other offices do 
they have a box for papers 
well we have we have one that 's recyclable and and then for uh lunch sacks and and waste food 
and and they gave us a list of things that are n't re- 
and it turns out it 's not so bad 
i- i- i get a lot of reports that that are covered in plastic or plas- like saran wrap or something anyway 
and then uh and cardboard there 's a few 
interesting that we 're we 're recycling computer type paper 
yeah 
and and and uh one day they 'll pick up uh 
the the cleaning people come through 
and they 'll pick up recycled paper 
and then the next day they 'll pick up the other 
so 
oh 
depending on how much uh you know 
and there 's a lot of 
uh actually it works pretty well 
and then we have uh uh waste uh cans for aluminum in the in the break areas at work 
well that 's that 's a really good idea because um like our uh frui- fruit juices for some reason when they 're in a can do n't come with a deposit 
and 
it th- they 're thinking about putting a deposit on them because pretty much you have to you 're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they 're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because most probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they 're beer and soda 
so oh yeah 
but when they sell juice it 's some strange quirk in the law you do n't have to have a deposit on it 
and even like the you know a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it 
but if it 's got soda in it it does 
so it 's a strange 
that 's an interesting distinction 
yeah 
they should they should clean clear that up 
it would n't take them much to put a stamp on uh on the uh juice cans as easily as the soda 
that yeah 
so but redemption centers are a big thing up here 
they get a penny a can they handle 
they give you five cents and the when they return the can to the distributor 
i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can 
well see well see those of us that do n't have state income taxes yet that 's the big debate here in texas that they their the legislature wants to put one in 
yeah 
and it 's interesting what people get upset about uh 
it it really is 
is bott- is bottle return down there a heated debate 
the the well no 
the the big issue was is is uh when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to uh drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck and throw it out the at the and at uh 
oh yeah 
well we 
w- w- well here you can n't can n't drink 
so we- we 're now civilized now 
you can no longer you you can not drink beer and drive 
but uh but it it was it was actually legal 
well 
yes 
well i know 
i was in atlanta 
and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand 
but here let me put that in a paper cup for you 
so that was strange 
but i think if some people 
they have they say well we 're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these um uh the the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to to recycle it 
and their problem 's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits see how they handle it and see if it 's a good way and then do it that way 
yeah 
because as i like to say people are making money on it 
well you know the other well the other thing is it also is is a is a a good habit uh to uh just to conserve resources you know whether you know because when you get in the habit of doing that you think in terms of of uh of of things like saving gas 
the cans do are worth something 
okay 
so are you a freshwater or 
mostly freshwater 
uh yeah 
freshwater 
i i used to fish uh when i was real young down in galveston with my parents 
and i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to to do anything 
and i did n't know anybody who had a boat now 
so i do n't fish too much in saltwater 
um-hum 
most of my fishing has been in the saltwater huh mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish and uh huh i have caught one or two small sharks and uh yes 
oh really 
oh neat 
oh really 
what 'd you do with them 
put them back 
you did n't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do 
no 
no 
no 
i love shark steak 
but uh the ones i caught were never large enough to uh really do anything 
do they have a limit on sharks 
i mean is that like a a sport fish 
can you actually catch those 
and there 's no limit 
uh is there a limit 
i have no idea 
i know i 
my home is in uh pensacola florida so it 's they do a lot of shark fishing in that you know in the gulf and um a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from i guess from galveston to mayport they have uh shark tournaments 
uh-huh 
right 
and you know there 's part 
either as part of or separate from the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done uh much freshwater uh fishing not oh for you know lake lake fishing for bass and so forth but uh maybe some what they call uh brim and those sorts of things but nothing 
right 
oh really 
right 
uh-huh 
i think i 've been trout fishing once 
uh i 've never fly fished 
have you fly fished 
uh no 
i have n't 
i do n't know that i could do that 
that looks awful tiring 
well i 've tried it once 
did you 
yes 
uh a friend of mine no 
did n't like it 
i could never get the hang of it 
it looks complicated to me 
it 's a rhythm or something 
uh-huh 
i usually ended snagging my uh fishing partners or the trees along the bank 
catching tree bass 
right 
yes 
almost got an owl once 
did you 
that would have been something 
but uh 
so do you do you fish mainly for trophies 
or do you do you eat what you fish 
oh no 
no 
no 
no 
i used uh when i was uh working in florida i used to do a lot of um surf fishing mostly for relaxation you know there are there are people who fish 
uh-huh 
right 
and then there are people who catch 
right 
well i 'm a fisher 
you just like to sit down and watch it right 
that 's right 
i i 've never caught uh that much 
but uh 
really 
oh and occasionally we 'd go out on a you know uh full day trip you know three or four other people and do either again bottom fishing or for grouper 
right 
right 
or i used to catch you know i 've caught a few worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth 
that 's nice 
what about you you a 
well most of my fishing is done at um area lakes around here freshwater lakes and um most of it 
um-hum 
i have n't been really in a long time 
last time i went i actually was in galveston trying to saltwater fish 
and it just was n't working with my freshwater tackle 
that was real fun 
um but um i went fishing at i do n't know if you 've ever heard of uh lake worth 
it 's a fairly new lake in texas 
oh yes 
and uh we went fishing there last memorial day 
and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep 
i was so excited 
and um that 's really about it 
mostly just the lakes around here 
and i i fish to take home and cook 
i do n't i do n't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching 
i get a little bit of relaxation from it 
but mainly i want to i want to say i brought something home 
i want to say i did this 
i was out there for a reason 
the last time i went uh bass fishing 
uh i was with my daughter a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter 
we i was the only one who did not catch a single fish my daughter caught fish 
really 
his daughter caught fish 
he caught fish 
everybody but you 
i did not even i did not even 
i have been i was out on a party boat a few years ago 
and we we were grouper fishing 
or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing 
everyone on the boat was catching snapper snappers except guess who 
it had to be you 
i co- i 
you could n't catch one to save your life right 
that 's right 
i would go from one side of the boat to the other 
and uh the uh the party boat captain could not understand you know 
he even even he started baiting my hook and holding holding the uh the fishing rod 
how funny 
just hoping maybe he could fool 
right 
and it was it was really really really bad 
uh i as i said i am a fisher 
i 'm not a catcher 
them right 
but uh i enjoy it though 
i do n't really get out as much as i uh as i would like too 
yeah 
and uh they do of course you know 
here in 
um we 're only just a you know few not a few minutes we 're you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in maryland and they do a lot of fishing there 
right 
of course what i used to like to do though is uh go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or uh or oy- for oysters 
oh yeah 
that would be fun 
and uh that i was able to do uh when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom 
right 
hand picked 
that 's right 
the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught 
we were in uh rockport which is close to corpus and we had been fishing in a canal 
um-hum 
they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area 
and uh we 'd been fishing in the canals 
and all we were catching were catfish 
and we were pretty bored with that 
so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here 
we 'll try to catch some crab 
so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything 
and something 
i had a rock to weight it down 
something grabs and just runs with it 
and of course there 's no hook 
so it can n't be a fish 
um-hum 
i 'm i 'm sure it 's not a fish 
right 
and crab they do n't bite like that 
they do n't just run with your food 
so i netted it 
and it was the ugliest fish i 've ever seen in my life 
it had real teeth like human teeth 
and it looked archaic 
i i had no idea what it was 
i called my father long distance just to describe the thing 
and it had the rock in it 's mouth it not the chicken 
but the rock itself is what it had grabbed 
hm 
they say it 's a dogfish from everything i 've described 
it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a croaker does it it was the strangest thing 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
it oh i 'll never get over that 
to this day i do n't want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because i 'm sure one of those fish are there 
well we used to 
i guess the weirdest thing i 've ever caught is uh in some of the inlets and the rivers around rehoboth delaware 
um-hum 
they have a fish that 's called an oyster cracker 
i do n't know if you 've ever heard of it and it has a huge strong mouth 
i 've never heard of that one 
and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters 
that 's where it gets its name obviously huh 
um-hum 
and this is the ugliest fish i have ever seen 
and i me- and they come in all si- you know 
i 've i 've caught them from you know three or four inches long up to uh 
um-hum 
i guess the la- largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long 
but just huge ugly things just terrible 
huh 
can you eat them 
no 
no 
ooh 
i i do n't think i 'd want to even if you could if they 're that ugly 
but 
they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them 
oh that 's like this dogfish 
it was it scared me to death 
um-hum 
it was u- it really it did n't look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died 
well the first time i went uh surf fishing was in 
and i threw my line out 
and the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or uh two feet long 
and scared me to death 
oh 
i i had never seen anything 
and then i was fi- fished for another half hour or forty five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth 
and then i felt something relatively heavy 
and i thought oh really here i 'm really going to get one 
and i pulled 
hi kay 
hi 
i uh was thinking about salaries and benefits and uh was wondering what 's the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job 
uh-huh 
well um i we just recently graduated from rice university 
and uh we were going through a lot of job interviews and things 
and some of the things that were important to me m- uh when my husband was looking for his job was um hours you know 
we he had been in graduate school 
so i was used to his not being home at all 
yeah 
so i was you know did n't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and you know even on the weekends and and um and things 
uh-huh 
so that was important to me and also insurance for the fa- our family because we 'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it 
sure 
yeah 
i do n't ever want to have to worry about that 
that 's real important to me 
um you know we have that that aetna um that 's what we the insurance that we have right now 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
us too 
when we were in colorado they had um a different type of hmo there that i really liked a lot 
um-hum 
it was um not that kind of hmo 's where you have to go to their they 're sort of like clinics you know uh but this was just an hmo where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular hospitals and all that 
um-hum 
but it was with a certain list of of doctors that you know participated in the hmo 
um-hum 
and um you know then you only had to pay the it for us it was a five dollar copayment every time you went to the doctor and uh three dollars for the prescriptions 
well that 's nice 
uh-huh 
that 's good 
and uh i especially liked the prescription especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time 
um-hum 
that those prescriptions can be very expensive 
oh i know 
we just went through that ourselves 
we just you know 
were like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things 
oh i know 
especially if you get what is it seclor i think that that just about breaks the bank right there 
um-hum 
the yes 
yes 
it 's pretty bad 
well yeah 
and we um we were interested in having de- dental insurance too 
because um we- having been in school we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff 
um-hum 
and we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over 
do y- do you have the basic plan or do you have the the other one 
and 
we have um you know 
we 're at aetna with uh an 
we have like the medi- 
the dental insurance is separate 
is that what you mean 
right 
and i do n't think it 's the basic 
i think it 's the other one 
the one that 's like you get additional 
they 'll pay a little bit more i think for the different procedures 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
we just have the basic right now 
and for most things it tends to cover it 
we do n't have too many major um expenses at this point 
but we have been able to find do- dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays 
a couple of times we 've had to pay oh i do n't know three to five dollars 
but that 's not that bad 
uh-huh 
no 
that 's great 
yeah 
we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too 
yes 
and let 's see 
besides insurance other things that we looked at um 
well my husband does not like to commute very far 
um-hum 
and and we do n't like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or something 
no 
we do n't like that either 
so we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located and how far well he 's uh you know he 's at the one that 's at um seventy five at uh six thirty five and so we- by living in plano we 're just about fifteen minutes away 
is his office in plano 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
oh that 's not bad 
and e- especially when they finish all the construction out here and we did n't want him to let you know to like 
right 
we had some job offers in the new york area 
and we thought well you know he would be really commuting and not only is it you know trouble to have to drive but it takes time away from your home and your family when you 're out driving 
oh yes 
you 're not kidding 
that 's right 
and um so that was something that was important to us 
and because l- like i say i we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long that we were anxious to do everything we could to have you know made us be more together 
and and what other 
can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and 
well tha- those are some of the things that are very important to us too 
um-hum 
um we we 'd like you know other benefits that are provided um 
the athletic facilities that that you can sometimes take advantage of um i think that 's that 's pretty nice 
um-hum 
but i have to say that since we 've come here we have n't done it too much though 
we have n't enrolled in too many of the classes or or any of that 
but that 's a that 's a nice benefit to have 
um-hum 
that 's true 
that 's really important 
um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be ha- having now 
but when when could uh your salary increase and is there was there somewhere to go 
right 
yeah 
that that 's one of the i think the hard things right now 
i mean they 're going through some some tough times to say the least 
um-hum 
uh i know many of us are thankful that he still has a job 
yes 
tha- that we can make our mortgage payments and 
yeah 
that 's really true 
uh uh one of the drawbacks i think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid um guidelines 
um if if an employee is especially exemplary i think it 's often in a smaller company it 's a little bit easier for them to say hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing 
a lot of times smaller companies have bonus plans where i think in a large company it 's hard to do that because there 're just so many people to deal with and you have to have guidelines if you know for salary increases and things like that 
um-hum 
um-hum 
just one of the things that that happens when someone when you 're dealing with a large company 
uh-huh 
but 
but well we also were interested in um you know being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work everyday and rather than thinking oh i really i can n't stand these people 
um-hum 
right 
i but uh so that 's something that was important to him and thinking he could um work under 
how long has he been in his present position 
tho- oh just since l- last summer 
uh-huh 
it 's only been not even a year yet 
so 
well i was going to say it sounds like you you picked out a lot of good things you know for him to to ha- to uh to choose in a position that has a lot of thought put into it 
in a big company though you also get moved around a lot 
yes 
we 're 
he may be having to drive over here to lewisville some time 
oh yeah 
or or we may be having to drive to plano 
you never know 
you never know 
we 're hoping that that wo n't be the case 
we i think one of the m- one of the most deciding factors of why we chose um this area is that um my husband was raised in irving and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family 
uh-huh 
and being 
when we were down in houston we were isolated 
i mean it 's not that far 
but people would ha- 
we did n't have anyone in town that was our family 
right 
and although we had really good friends and and we had church and school support and things um we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that 
yeah 
we 're very we 're very far from our families 
so that really made a big difference i think in why we chose ti and chose to move this way 
and it 's really hard 
fam- little children 
and um they were the only grandchildren 
and so our our families are are are really far away 
in fact this is a little off the topic 
but yesterday my mother happened to be on a train going from phoenix to back to chicago and it stopped in dallas for a half an hour 
um-hum 
so i loaded the kids in the car 
and we went downtown and met her train for half an hour and brought her a little snack and an easter basket 
and 
oh that 's nice 
i think it it made her trip a little bit nicer 
yeah 
and it is i think it is important to you know want to be close to your family 
and 
yeah 
i mean i- it 's hard 
i mean to to just for us to snatch a half hour like that is is a special occasion for us 
um-hum 
so um it 's nice 
well 
that 's definitely the way we feel 
it 's nice that you can have your family close like that 
we 're really enjoying it 
i wonder what it would be like 
i mean i i wanted to be close to family 
but i also thought that it would be harder to be close to family 
yeah 
sometimes it can be 
but it 's turned out really good 
and i think that you know we 're really satisfied with that choice 
and we you know kind of felt like um it was worth it to us 
that 's good 
but anyway 
well i my children just ran out the door 
so i need to go check on them 
okay 
but i 've really enjoyed this c- conversation 
well i have too 
and and uh nice to have met you 
and you have a good day 
okay 
you too 
okay bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
well um discussing air pollution today i guess 
um-hum 
um uh well give me your first impressions 
uh i do n't kn- 
there 's a lot of air pollution 
yeah 
um i think industries and companies provide a lot of it and with uh i guess with the oil burning over in kuwait and stuff that would have a lot of air pollution in it 
um-hum 
uh puts a whole yeah gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be 
but uh that stuff going on over there 
wha- what uh what part of pennsylvania are you in 
um i 'm north of pittsburgh 
so 
o- okay 
okay 
so it 's i- it 's amazing too you know y- with that with the oil wells burning over there 
that 's that 's the exact same stuff that 's coming out of cars every day just in uh just in a little different grade i guess 
yeah 
but uh in dallas we 've got we 've just uh brought in a whole new set of uh requirements on inspections and things like that for cars because uh people just do n't use mass transit and stuff in dallas 
everybody loves their car 
and you see an awful lot of uh one person vehicles on the road on during rush hours 
that seems to be our biggest problem down here 
um you know there 's uh there 's a lot of industry around 
but uh it 's not it 's 
any pollution that industry 's dumping around here is not going into the air 
it 's typically water type situation 
yeah 
um we have a couple we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff 
and i know there 's a lot of air pollution going in there 
and like they they get fined whenever they do the air pollution but the fine is nothing you know 
um-hum 
yeah 
it 's it 's yeah like like two hours of output or something like that 
it 's like nothing to them 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah that 's true 
that 's true 
um-hum 
yeah 
i uh i grew up in south dakota 
so i was never i was never exposed to anything of of the of the sort 
uh-huh 
um there were always the epa people and what not were always telling us that uh farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that but we just we just never saw the results 
um-hum 
uh there was there was dust in the air during uh planting seasons and what not 
but uh that that was all we ever saw 
and then five years ago i i moved to dallas 
and i suddenly start to understand what uh burning eyes uh and all that stuff is about that i 'd always heard about 
it uh it 's it gets it 's real depressing 
um in the morning sometime uh just y- you can tell if it 's a good day or a bad day by uh how far out from downtown uh y- you can be on the road and still not see it 
oh my god 
and uh 
you know i mean it 's not 
uh i do n't think dallas is considered uh a a real bad place for for air pollution 
but you you can tell you can tell the differences in the days when it 's when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a a foggy misty color and uh it it 's a little it 's a little disappointing sometimes that you start to realize what you 're breathing 
uh-huh 
uh yeah 
but i do n't know what they can do to really prevent it you know 
like how 
c- what can they do about the oil burning over in kuwait 
what you know 
i mean they fine the the industries 
but you know that does n't seem to stop them there i do n't know what else they can do 
right 
right 
i- it 's that there really is n't a whole lot 
i- it 's one of those uh it 's one of those things that if they do a little bit 
and uh and e- you know e- every little bit does help 
i i do believe that 
um but i also believe that uh the earth is is a kind of a self-regulating system 
and uh it will clean itself up eventually 
it 
the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess l- let the you know let the natural natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible 
um-hum 
yeah 
i i 
yeah 
i just do n't understand you know what else anyone can do about it 
i do n't think it 's something that people really think about either 
um-hum 
you know it 's i mean i it it should probably be a big issue you know because i- it 's doing a lot of damage 
but i 
it 's something you know 
i do n't think many people really think about it because it 's nothing they 
i do n't think we really have too much control over it 
right 
and it 's one of those things i- i- it 's so hard to measure uh wh- what what the damage is it 's it 's kind of like 
um-hum 
uh oh i guess it 's kind of like kind of like cigarette smoking you know 
i- it it it could go on for years and years until they they s- start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah it 's it 's it 's doing it 's doing some damage and and something 's got to be done 
um-hum 
um there 's you know there 's a lot of things like that 
i- it it 
you can uh you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks 
but until it breaks you do n't really know that there you were doing anything to it 
yeah 
exactly 
but uh 
well i really do n't know too much else about it 
yeah 
well that 's it you know 
i i i think we both agree it 's it 's one of those deals that uh 
i just think there 's a lot of other problems right now and uh we 've done a lot to take care of it 
um-hum 
yeah 
and uh 
yeah 
we have tried 
i mean you know and um i i know where you know where a couple of the mills that have 
i kn- i know they put things on their stacks you know to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things 
but i mean every now and then it breaks you know 
and and you just got smoke going out into the air for a day or two till you can get it fixed 
oh sure 
sure 
and stuff so you know it 's something we we have tried to help 
oh there 's no doubt about 
but yeah 
i do n't know if you if you ever happened to see uh some of the like twenty twenty and what not about uh romania and east germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their uh systems had been running for twenty and thirty years and uh you know they absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted 
um 
um-hum 
that 's that 's the kind of things that uh you do n't see in this country 
and that 's that 's why i think that you know i- it 's 
i do n't know if you can ever do enough 
but uh i think it 's all relative to the to the time and place 
and i think right now it 's it 's it 's pretty much under control 
yeah 
okay 
well 
all righty 
um-hum 
it 's been nice talking to you 
well you bet 
ye- okay 
bye-bye 
bye 
all right 
well on this subject i really had n't had to deal with putting someone in there yet 
but my mother 's always been administrator of a nursing home so i 've always been involved you know in one 
uh-huh 
how do you feel about them i mean since you 've kind of been close to that 
well i 've yes well i can kind of see both sides you know 
i really can 
um nursing homes to me 
i- i would personally be the last resort you know i rea- you know if i had to put someone in there 
uh-huh 
well i 've had a touch of experience 
my um dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother could n't take care of him 
yeah 
if it 's a have to thing 
yeah 
i 
yeah 
and uh she put him in 
but he was n't there very long before he died but um i guess um the one time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that 's always kind of bothered me 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
well i kind of think that 's true too i guess because it 's so under staffed you know that 's like everything else though 
um-hum 
i have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home 
but i 've never actually been there and i know that she 's the kind of person who would n't allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yes 
but 
but still i 'm sure there are you know aspects to it that are n't really desirable 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i know 
because i 've always 
well my sister 's involved in one also 
and i really think they really do a wonderful job 
but still there 's those little things that happens you know there really is which 
yeah 
i think it 's a wonderful place you know if it comes to that you know if you just can n't take care of them any more 
well sometimes you do n't have any other alternative after all family and friends are usually well family 's tied up with their own lives and things and usually working 
uh-huh 
that 's it 
yeah uh-huh 
other things 
and it 's hard to 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah but i think when the time comes i- i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at 
yes 
um-hum 
i think that 's important too 
in fact there 's a 
not just i do too 
outside 's awful deceiving sometimes you know 
yes 
there 's one uh close to where my mother is 
but in order to get in you have to be able to um walk in on your own 
in other words you can n't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with 
yeah 
yeah 
but then if you deteriorate um they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time 
ca- 
yeah 
yeah 
but it 's always uh well 
and they have a long waiting list too 
so there 's always this feeling of well golly gee you know you 've got to be able to walk in the door 
so you can n't wait until you 're too bad off but then you do n't want to go do that when you do n't have to because like uh you have to give up your automobile or whatever 
off 
yeah 
to 
oh 
um-hum 
and everything you worked f- so hard for all your life yeah 
yeah and if you 're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee i 'm you know i 'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
so it 's kind of a that 's a hard one 
but it is a very nice nursing home 
now there is some really nice ones 
there 's also you know some private ones you know but of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that you know 
um-hum 
yeah 
that 's the problem the expense of it all is 
i mean that 's way out of my reach 
and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately 
uh-huh yeah oh yeah 
but those who do n't have money can go in and get the same care you know 
yeah uh-huh the very same 
yeah 
so i do n't like that aspect 
yeah 
yeah but i 
there 's i think there 's ways around it though that you know 
like they could put it in one of their children 's names or something you know 
yeah 
but still a lot of them does n't feel comfortable doing that 
you know it 's their money 
this is that 's right 
you know that 's how i feel about it anyway 
well yeah 
i 've talked to my mother about that several times lately 
and i- i said well i want you to have control of your own business 
yes 
but you know what if 
yeah 
yeah my mother 's seventy now 
so naturally she 's retired 
but she 's still on her own i mean 
yeah 
yeah 
my mother 's uh seventy five and still has her own home and everything 
you know yeah i think that 's wonderful 
i really do 
just as long as they can 
and then on the other hand i 've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know 
yeah 
that 's true 
they have a lot of people around to do things with 
uh-huh 
they 're not lonely 
some of those places have wonderful activities and things you know lots of stuff going on 
oh yes 
uh-huh 
and they 'll take them places and so i do n't know 
yeah 
it 's not all bad but i guess once you get ill then you know you really have some problems if you can n't get around and do things 
no 
around 
yeah 
but i really do n't know what the other solution would be you know 
no 
i really do n't 
but no 
when the time comes i 'm really hopefully we 'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents really do 
um-hum 
because i have been raised in one you know 
so there 's lot of things i know to look for 
yeah 
and i do n't think they 'd want to go where they used to work either you know 
yeah 
i really do n't 
that might be kind of tough huh 
it really would 
yes 
yes 
and li- like i said my sister 's still in it 
and i really do n't think my mother want to be there either 
oh 
well it 's been nice talking to you 
well you too 
and i guess we 'd better get back to work huh 
okay 
all right 
bye-bye 
bye 
well do you exercise regularly judy 
um i try to ride the stationary bicycle everyday about five miles and i love to walk 
um-hum 
so if i have a lunch hour with nice weather i get out and and walk 
what about you 
well um i uh exercise regularly 
i work at a university 
and i swim almost everyday upwards of a mile 
uh very good 
but washington is one of my favorite places to visit 
uh my daughter lives in arlington 
and when i go to visit her i love to get out on that bike trail and either ride the bike 
oh gosh you can ride a bike practically all the way to southern virginia or just get out and walk uh or even jog a little although i do n't do that regularly 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
but washington 's a great place to do that 
yeah 
there are there are lots of bike paths 
i know my son is a biker 
and he he 's done the whole c and o canal i think it 's a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts 
um-hum 
and so uh but tha- that somehow takes organization 
for me it 's much easier just the stationary bike you know 
it 's at home 
i can i can do some of my reading 
right 
um but 
do you live in the district 
no 
i live in maryland 
uh-huh because i think there 're so many parts of the district where it 's not very safe to get out and walk 
right 
right 
and that 's it um 
at work we have a a nice campus 
so i 'm able to um take advantage of of the environment here um the neighborhood also 
um-hum 
i mean we 're within walking distance of of stores and shops 
so i do 
now i think um 
basically is your motive simply um health or because you enjoy it 
well it 's uh it 's really both 
i 'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape 
and uh and most of the time i enjoy it 
sometimes i do n't 
but i feel that uh that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i do n't want to is also worth something 
um-hum 
right 
i think pretty much you 've summed up my my my motivations also 
and i often find that even when i do n't feel that much like exercising 
like i 'll be really tired 
and i 'll start swimming 
and i 'll act- and i 'll actually get energy 
and i 'll be have much more energy when i 'm done than when i started 
i mean i just feel great 
that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim 
oh well that 's great 
that 's great 
that 's really a terrific feeling because you just go there at the end of the day and you figure god i 'm ready for bed and you exercise and then it 's sort of it 's painful for a while 
um-hum 
but by the time you get done you 're feeling really terrific 
right 
and actually in in summer i like to swim 
we do n't have facilities for swimming in winter 
but um and and that 's true 
when i go home from work at the end of the day if i go up for an hour in the pool i 'm much much more awake 
i 'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening 
yeah 
yeah 
so 
so are can i just ask you are you canadian 
no 
i 'm not 
philadelphia 
no 
i 'm trying to because you have a you have one funny vowel that 's probably going to drive the ti people crazy 
oh really 
you say out 
instead of out you say out 
did you know that 
no 
i do n't know that 
but i i must say that um when when i did do a linguistics course in in school ages ago um the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent 
hm 
and it 's probably because i i was born in the chicago area and grew up in california 
and a- and at that point that was sort of a limit but but since then i 've been abroad a lot 
hm 
so it 's a mixture 
i see 
i know this is n't on our topic 
but where did you grow up in california 
in santa barbara 
oh okay 
because i grew up in north hollywood california i went to ucla and all that 
oh i see 
um-hum 
well very good 
an- i think we 've probably know know each other 's exercise habits and um it was nice talking to you 
yes 
well same here 
thanks for calling 
oh okay 
bye 
bye bye 
so what do you think about it 
how are we doing in recycling 
are we 
well i think we need to do more 
i- i mean i know i need to do more 
they have programs around where you can reach they uh 
they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up 
um-hum 
but i have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash 
and get all the cans from the paper 
yeah 
and you know i just have n't gotten that dedicated yet 
so 
yeah and see i do a lot of work with the boy scouts 
and we try to do a lot but there 's still a lot more we can do 
uh-huh 
yeah 
you know i do n't recycle my newspapers myself 
but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a like a a clothes hamper kind of thing that you know you lay your string in then you put your papers in there and tie them all up and bundle them up 
uh-huh 
so i figured i might get me one of those because we do n't always read the newspaper 
uh-huh 
sometimes it just sits around for a while 
and then we just chuck it 
yeah 
well i do n't i do n't get the paper every day 
but i you know i get it on 
i i try to buy you know the early edition for the coupons you know the sunday edition 
so 
yeah 
but then i just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk ev- you know every monday or every other monday and have them pick that up 
yeah 
but that 's the extent of what i 've done 
i 'd like to be able to do more 
the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know it 's not always convenient to do it 
yeah 
see and 
yeah 
see and here in lubbock everything 's so close 
i can imagine what it 's like up there 
yeah 
i 'm not exactly sure where the you know the can thing is 
but you know sometimes it 's just so 
seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them 
yeah 
yeah see i went out to payless cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall and then i put me a little five gallon bucket 
uh-huh 
and it 's just outside the garage door so every time we drink a coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket 
uh-huh 
do those can crushers work good 
yeah 
i got one from payless cashways 
and it 's actually metal it 's not plastic 
uh-huh 
i did n't want to buy a plastic one 
yeah 
because those things i think would just snap you know 
yeah 
but payless cashways has them 
and they 're metal 
and i do n't know what affiliate of payless cashways you have up there 
but it was only like seven dollars not too bad 
oh 
i 'd i 'd have to check into something like that because i mean we do n't drink a whole lot of soda around here you know 
but um you know occasionally we have some around 
so yeah 
but you know for other kind of cans just to it 'd probably only take aluminum cans like that do n't they 
yeah 
i do n't 
yeah 
i do n't think it would crush steel cans 
it 's pretty tough 
yeah 
so i do n't know 
i do n't think you have to to crush the other ones for them to get to take that 
but i need to look into it more 
no 
you could probably just you know 
you know it 's you know it 
sometimes even with the newspaper they say only they 'll only take certain types of paper you know 
they wo n't take paper that 's shiny 
yeah they wo n't yeah they wo n't take any lint free paper 
or see i work at ti and 
yeah 
so does my husband 
yeah 
we do a lot of recycling out there 
uh-huh 
now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard 
but that 's just now come on board 
uh-huh 
you know we 've been throwing paper out there away for years 
and we 're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big earth day thing came out you know 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i do n't know what 
you know i have n't 
i 'm sure they 're probably doing that here some 
yeah 
i 'm sure they are 
ti is doing it pretty well nationwide i 'm sure 
uh-huh 
i think it 's necessary 
i- i like it 
you know it makes 
i think it 's good that you see these you know like boxes cereal 
they 're now starting to make them you know the packages out of recycled paper 
and and i 've bought you know i 've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper 
oh yeah 
and i think they 're just fine 
yeah 
yeah i bought a 
i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work 
it 's his birthday 
we 're pretty good friends 
and what it is is a recycled paper bag and it 's just got happy birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside 
uh-huh 
and it 's just a paper bag you know and it 's really cute 
uh-huh 
yeah 
but i think we 're doing better and better all the time 
yeah i think i think we 're getting becoming more conscious because we just can n't stick everything in landfills any more 
i still do n't 
so 
no 
there 's not going to be any room shortly 
no 
no 
you know i do n't know what new york does about theirs 
i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere 
yeah 
it 's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere 
yeah 
so but i think we 're getting better at it i think there 's quite a bit more we could do 
yeah yeah 
girls put that away 
now 
but you 're right sometimes it does seem like it 's more trouble than what it would would be worth 
yeah 
i just wish it was a little more conv- convenient to do 
but yeah 
you know seems like you 're so busy anyway 
and then that 's just one more thing to have to worry about 
so 
yeah 
it sure is 
i think if you know the cities locally you know they 'd get more programs going so that you could do that it 'd make it a lot easier 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
well they 'll get at it sooner 
i guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later 
but yeah 
yeah 
yeah get the kids interested in it too 
the- you know they have 
we tried to have a aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have 
and we just do n't have any place to store those kind of cans 
so yeah 
you know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they 'll save them for us there n- there 's no problem there 
uh-huh 
but what do you do with them in the meantime 
that 's right 
now i do n't want a can a garage full of cans 
that 's right 
who does 
that you know people do n't have room for that kind of stuff 
you know 
no 
they 're just not they 're not prepared for it 
no 
and in texas they 're just get things like that 
they just get bugs in them 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
they do 
so you do n't 
and you know the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get 
that 's for sure 
that 's right 
so 
so 
i 'm pretty lazy about it right now 
everything goes into one thing and goes out to the 
yeah 
you know pick it up 
so 
yeah 
myself 
about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans 
oh uh-huh 
so 
yeah well i need to get b- get better at it 
so 
well if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way 
yeah 
that 's right 
that 's right 
you know if everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then we 'll get there 
hm that 's true 
that 's right 
well thank you for talking to me 
yeah 
well thank you for calling 
i 
sure 
no problem 
okay 
take care 
all righty 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
so do you all keep a budget 
no 
we do n't 
you do n't 
no 
i just i- i make so much money here at ti that that we just spend it 
and we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck 
it 's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semiconductor firm 
you can just spend it well 
well are you being smart 
or are you serious 
i 'm being facetious 
i 'm being very comical 
uh we have a budget um that works well 
uh-huh 
i kind of look at it for more of a 
we have a financial uh analyst a finance administrator i guess that that uh 
or i guess the financial planners the training now 
we 've had it for about four years who 
uh-huh 
got our businesses and and and our life in line how to manage credit cards how to put away say for you know money markets and this kind of thing 
yeah 
and there 's some freebies out there are 
you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly monthly bring home in some sort of savings account 
um-hum 
yeah 
that being money market uh bonds coda mat savings uh or a listed liquid account and which which we do 
um-hum 
um you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there 's a major need for that 
um-hum 
okay 
you should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your uh life insurance and your medical and your um um car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm 
he 's going to sue the pants off of you 
these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year 
so yo- you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things 
um-hum 
some of them are there to pacify situations 
and some of them are there to prevent things from happening 
um-hum 
but uh i guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a a child which is about a year old 
and then uh we 've just been kind of working on 
um-hum 
i 've been developing it 
but it 's kind of hard 
diaper prices are going up you know and formula and stuff you know 
um-hum 
that 's funny 
yeah 
we have a 
we 're twenty eight and he 's been working at ti for five years 
and that was pretty much his first really really major job of any you know professional because he 'd worked you know part time during school and what not 
and uh he was a little late graduating 
so we 're you know uh 
and we have a nine and a half year old son 
and it 's because you know we were eighteen when we had him 
so we 're we 're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities we 've had on us for at such a young age 
you know we have a like a nice house 
people you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house 
but we do n't you know live in a brand new house either maybe an eighty ninety hundred thousand dollar house we live in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty five thousand 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so you know we have trade-offs 
so we 're more we have a monthly budget with this this this this 
but we have no savings which is n't real wise 
but we just we do n't have the income at this time really to have any because we have um three debts that we 're trying to pay off from both of our student loans 
we 're still paying trying to pay those off 
um-hum 
and we have one car payment that we 're i think we have about thirteen months left on it 
and after that we either 
what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment um 
they 'll pay 
our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans 
so what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars and um pay on the student loans split that car payment in half and pay you know double up payments on both our loans 
and it 'll work out perfect 
do you have your uh loans through the texas credit union 
no 
we do n't 
okay 
thing about the credit union is it 's the way it 's set up is if you have two thousand dollars left let 's say on on the loan 
um-hum 
if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it does n't all go towards principal 
um-hum 
they take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of you know 
um um-hum 
so it 's like one of these lose or swim type of credit 
one of those loans not really the best in the world 
but but you know they- they 're uh 
since your husband is is is um uh a tier 
but does n't have the loans with the credit union they 're offering something that might be worth taking a gander at 
really 
i do n't know what your percent is on your on your car payments but they are they 'll take any ti non credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
they 'll take it and refinance it and put it with texas credit union at i think it 's a ten and a quarter percent which is not a bad deal 
oh really 
um-hum 
one of the secretaries we have down here is is paying twelve percent through gmac or something 
um-hum 
and she 's doing it 
i mean it 's not like it 's like 
does she have to pay to have it refinanced 
i think they even cover that because they want you as a uh uh they want the tier to be part of the credit union 
um-hum 
tier to 
see 
we got ripped off buying our new car 
we both come out of uh drugs and stuff 
and we became christians about five years ago 
right when right when he got hired for ti right before he got hired for ti he 'd uh gotten saved and stuff 
and so i mean when you get come out of drugs and stuff you have nothing 
i mean you know you do n't have anything 
you have the clothes on your back 
and you might have a car and that kind of thing 
and so when he when he started working at ti we uh you know we really felt like god told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas 
but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years 
and we were young 
and we 'd look about nineteen 
people still think we 're about 
they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff both of us 
and so it 's just kind of strange you know 
so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs you know 
yeah 
so we went in and they financed the car for five 
and we did n't know that 
we got kind of taken just a little bit 
so we 're kind of upset that we 're having to you know pay this fifth year on the car because it was just not a wise thing 
but we learned a good lesson 
so you know 
well five years is not that uh you know five years is not that bad of a problem only because you 're paying more interest 
but your um p- your payments are lower 
yeah 
but they they would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher 
and he want 
oh really 
yeah 
he just told me this last week that he he said do n't you remember i asked them to finance it at four years 
and they came back 
and they said that they had it figured for five 
and we 'd already signed the papers 
and i maybe i might have been there 
i do n't remember hearing that 
but i also was n't the one in charge of it 
so i was n't paying as close of attention 
sure 
but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know 
so anyway 
so next time we 'll do that different 
we want to next time pay cash for our car too 
we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do 
when we buy a house we attended a bill guathier financial seminar 
and he has a lot of wisdom on that just on biblical you know principles to finance 
um-hum 
he runs a big the largest real estate company in fort worth debt free 
and we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying 
and if we do take out a loan on a house in the future what we 'll do is pay twice a twice a month on it and because you save a lot in interest just doing that 
yes 
and then 
you save a lot 
right 
if if if if 
and you need to be very careful 
if the loan is set up to have bi- they call it a yuppie loan if it 's set up for bimonthly payments 
right 
if you 
because you 'll save se- fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan 
right 
sev- i 'm sorry seven to nine years off the end of the loan 
right 
and there are there is a local firm that 'll actually 
if if 
like in my situation i do n't have that because the loan was not available 
i can ha- 
this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee 
so i can cut that much off the end of 
but i 'm not interested because we 're moving out of the house next year 
um-hum oh really 
yeah 
but uh those are all great 
uh-huh 
the the interesting thing we 're getting ready to have a house built is it 's not a lot of the firms that offer 
uh-huh 
mor- mortgage loan firms are n't offering um that loan 
um-hum 
i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal 
but it 's not as open as it it should be 
yeah 
it 's a great idea 
hell i 'd love to cut ours in half 
but uh man 
um-hum 
and if you figure get with a financial person 
yeah 
and you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan if you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house payment it 'll make uh 
um-hum 
it has a magic with numbers 
it i it 'll shave almost you know x number of dollars off 
right 
yeah 
we real we 've become aware of that 
we have a there 's a loan officer through our church too that i think could help us better 
you know he does that full time with the bank you know 
um-hum 
and so we 're going to use people that we 're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity 
so 
sure 
you know that is another thing that you know 
we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time 
we buy a car we 're not just going to go to toyota of irving you know 
we 're going to go to somebody that we know 
we 're going to take someone with us older 
and we did n't do any of those things 
somebody you trust 
uh you know there are so many rip-off artists here in this town 
it 's it 's and it 's uh it 's really a sin 
it really is 
yeah 
i got taken on some fire- on firewood 
really 
i mean uh uh the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood 
and my wife did n't know 
and i stopped payment on the check 
and he 'd already been paid by a cashing firm 
and and they 're suing us they 're suing me on this 
and it 's for a hundred and thirty four dollars 
oh my 
absolutely pathetic 
i stopped payment on a check 
oh that 's funny 
oh this last week we bought a sewing machine at zak 's 
and then i found that you could get the same machine better for less locally 
not much less but it was enough less 
and i found they locally serviced it 
and we just stopped payment on the check 
so i hope they do n't sue us over it 
but we never received any merchandise either 
so i do n't think it would hold any anyway 
oh okay 
well so- well probably something like -at 
did you call them and tell them you just you just 
no 
we did n't even call them 
we just did it 
maybe my husband should call today 
might be a good idea because because you 're going to get what a a check uh 
so do you have any credit cards 
yes 
i do 
i keep uh i have an american express and a visa card that i keep you know kind of for emergency purposes 
and i have you know i use a gasoline credit card which i you know pay off every every month 
um-hum 
okay 
but i 've i 've gotten rid of all of the credit cards you know that i possibly could 
and my balances are practically zero on the ones that i have especially since you know it 's no longer after this year or after tax year nineteen ninety there 's there 's no deductions for you know credit card interest that you pay 
um-hum 
so it 's a you know 
gosh credit cards run what anywhere from up to eighteen nineteen percent i guess 
yeah 
it 's just a bad deal 
course there are emergencies you know that you you know probably need to have a card 
yeah 
i have one card 
uh-huh 
that 's that 's probably enough 
and i try not to use it 
but right now it 's maxed out 
absolutely 
yeah it 's it 's very easy to you know to do that or you know to abuse it 
it really is 
um-hum 
it 's so easy to pull out the plastic 
but we 're trying our best not to not to add any you know credit card debt to our structure here 
yeah 
um i have uh 
the thing that that bothers me worse than the credit cards i think is uh 
you mentioned the gasoline credit card 
uh-huh 
i do n't have that 
but i 've got you know one of the the uh instant teller cards that you can use for point of sale purchases 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and we use that usually to buy gasoline 
and it 's just it 's really amazing how quickly that goes 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh i 'm sure you 're right 
i do n't i do n't i do n't participate in that 
but you know a lot of folks do 
um-hum 
yeah 
at least with the uh gasoline company credit cards you have you know up to thirty twenty five thirty days you know interest free for it 
yeah 
but you know the instant thing may be may may be the way of the future to you know to replace checks and every other thing 
yeah 
that 's what 
they 've they 've talked about it 
yeah 
of course it eliminates any waiting period 
it certainly does 
and god help those people who have to float checks occasionally because you wo n't be able to with that 
absolutely 
that 's right 
do you get any sort of discount when you use a card like that 
no 
i see 
oh it was 
well they consider it to be the same as cash well because it actually is 
i see 
i see 
i it certainly is 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's better than cash 
uh-huh 
they do n't even have to deposit it 
it just goes straight in there 
that 's right 
no returned checks or anything 
right 
yeah 
no 
i i understand it 's becoming you know the popular thing to do 
we 're not participating in that particular program at the moment 
and i do n't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to 
um-hum 
but uh i have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards 
it 's just you know too easy to do 
yeah 
but i 'm so glad he told me that when that they they got to such a point with their credit cards they did n't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them 
that 's right 
they paid them off 
and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them 
she said at least before she could use them she 'd have to thaw them out 
i mean that 's funny 
well that 's a novel idea 
yeah 
that would cause you think a little while would n't it 
that may not be a bad idea 
but i 'm kind of getting a little more leery of credit cards you know as time goes by 
unless you just absolutely have to 
now there are times when you 'd at least think you do anyway 
yeah 
yeah 
i- i want to still have just one just in case 
so we yeah 
but i 'd sure want to get the get it paid down and not use it for a while 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's right 
my wife and i really i guess are fortunate 
we 're really not compulsive shoppers you know 
um-hum 
we we plan purchases you know pretty well you know watch for the best buys things like that 
but uh some people have a real problem with it 
yeah 
well our our limit is you know fairly low and uh so that 's that 's one thing that 's good 
uh-huh 
sure 
absolutely 
yeah 
oh i 've got another call 
oh i 'm sorry 
it was nice talking to you 
okay 
take care 
all right 
bye-bye 
bye bye 
okay uh 
let 's see 
i i believe in the trial by jury 
i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for uh payoffs you know briberies uh unfairness one-sidedness you know all those kinds of things 
and i i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody 
i r- i really agree with the uh innocent until proven guilty theory 
i think that 's that 's a good way to do it you know 
that 's about all 
well i think i think basically we 're in a lot of agreement uh in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs uh some kind of legal definition 
um-hum 
but for anything involving that a trial by jury certainly should be mandatory 
um-hum 
but there should be uh with our overworked uh judicial system 
it seems to me like there ought to be a means of of um not having to take everything before a full court you know 
maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh 
a- as as an example where called a jury duty now 
um-hum 
really 
and and maybe instead of of uh just kind of blowing it off and just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do maybe we should commit to spend a week 
and during that week you 're kind of an ad hoc let 's hear about it group of i do n't know twenty five instead of twelve and ea- each case is presented to that group of of twenty five 
um-hum 
and those cases are of lesser degrees of magnitude you know 
the guy was caught burgling 
uh and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught uh you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor 
um-hum right 
and there 's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing 
yeah 
but the way our system our court system works that guy 's going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time 
right 
uh i just think our system is overworked 
and we 're starting to stress the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial 
yeah 
that 's that 's a good idea 
maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of uh you know where they could go from there 
do they need a big lengthy uh twelve person ju- jury 
or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things 
and the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know 
how 
is this open and shut you know like you were saying 
or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened you know a jury like that 
you know we 
yeah that 's uh that could be a good idea to 
uh that could work 
you know kind of deltaing off what what we 've been talking about here uh i believe that our we- we 've become almost litigious uh society where we 're e- everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff 
and although we 're supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we do n't need to do that 
um-hum yeah 
uh-huh 
you know maybe instead of of being so quick to sue you uh if you have a disagreement with someone instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you nee- you 
and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent need to go face this group of twenty five or a judge wapner like you know that they have on tv and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case 
huh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
that 
and let 's you know let 's get rid of some of this harassment suing 
right 
that 's that 's a good idea 
i 
in the bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them first 
and if that does n't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them 
and if that does n't work to take it to the whole church 
so that 's right off that same kind of principle 
you bet 
and if if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we would n't have half the 
that 's a that 's a good idea 
yeah 
that 's true 
that 's true too 
but uh you know that whole biblical concept like that that 's true in a lot of our 
um you know the the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that 
it does n't work on that 
but it 's based out of that 
and uh so that you know that could work 
yes 
i 'd forgotten what that 's called 
there 's a a real name for that like the judean law or something like that 
there um what is that called 
the judeo-christian ethic 
judeo-christian ethic 
well that may be right 
it 's in there some place 
yeah 
i think we both know w- that we 're talking about the foundation of our legal society 
right 
right 
right 
uh t- and too the 
that was sort of the the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly 
um-hum 
uh i guess the the lord started out with we 'll treat you f- i 'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say 
uh that 's sort of the old testament version 
yeah 
that 's 
i know 
i did a sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the old testament and the new testament where where there 's a vengeful lord in the old testament and there 's a loving lord in the new testament 
really 
but that 's a whole different subject 
really 
really 
yeah 
okay 
well i i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on on the legal system 
mine too 
yeah 
mine too 
but it 's been a pleasure talking with you 
yeah 
same here 
wha- what part of the country are you from 
i 'm living here in texas 
oh okay 
in in texas 
okay 
i was just being curious 
okay 
well that 's quite all right 
yeah 
well i 'm i 'm from the dallas area 
well so am i 
oh okay 
well that 's that 's neat 
fact i 'm at work out at lewisville 
oh are you really 
wow 
okay 
well i 'll let you go 
and it was nice talking to you 
my pleasure 
have a good day 
oh you too 
bye-bye 
bye 
all right 
we need to discuss the voters on a national and a local level 
yes 
i i 
why do you think the apathy exists 
i blame it to apathy 
yeah um 
i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote does n't count anyway 
i mean why why bother voting if um if your vote wo n't make a difference 
so for instance in um the last presidential election i 'm sure a lot of people thought oh bush is going to win either way 
why bother voting 
why should i go out of my way when it does n't matter 
that 's right 
i think that 's 
and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they 're not going to win 
so some are saying dukakis is 
certainly not going to win 
why bother voting for him 
so i thi- i i think that 's a big uh a big a big reason for it 
how about 
oh i think so too 
and i think the other thing is the news me- media puts such a blitz on it that they 've uh they had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting you know 
um that 's true 
actually i never thought about that 
that that 's a good rea- 
and i i think the 
you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news 
and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it does n't make any difference due to the overabundance of news we have available to us 
that 's true 
that 's true 
um-hum 
what do you think on the local elections though 
that i think on the local elections it 's actually um 
i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like well you know the country 's real important 
and you know if i el- if we help elect a president who 's going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved 
but they figure local elections do n't mean that much i suspect 
so people do n't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that 
so people think that that that they do n't have um that that it does- does n't matter as much whereas i think it 's probably just the opposite is true 
i think it 's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level 
oh i think so too 
absolutely 
uh i think another thing 
and uh i 'm making a judgment here that may or may 
i think it is totally wrong 
well 
uh 
i think that the people that are u- have um a lower income which you automatically equate with lower education tend not to be registered 
right 
um 
and they do n't register 
and they do n't understand that you can n't go and vote and register all at the same time 
or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would and i believe in this 
right 
but 
but 
yeah 
that that 's possible 
i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes do n't make a difference though as well 
i think it 's those same people who do n't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i 'm just a little nobody 
my vote 's not going to count anyway 
you know and i think that 's probably a portion of the population that 's massively under represent- 
i i i would guess that tha- that portion of the population is massively under represented 
i had an interesting comment one time a thought that would never have crossed my mind 
i had someone tell me that i will never register to vote because i do n't serve on a jury 
and hum 
what do they have to do with one another 
that 's i i i just i tha- i just wandered off from that one 
i was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection 
oh so they did n't want to wind up being a juror ever 
so they were 
if they do n't vote they do n't have to be on a jury 
oh i did n't realize that actually 
that 
there is convoluted logic for you 
yeah 
there is 
there there there are much easier ways to get out of jury duty 
yes 
just go in and say oh i want to be a juror 
i can spot a guilty person a mile away 
oh i just 
right 
right 
there are so many other ways 
but that one just it defeated me 
i did n't have any answer for that one 
that one was just beyond my imagination 
well that that just seems to be a person who just does n't care about much of anything around sort of you know does n't does n't sort of likes rights probably but does n't like respon- responsibilities 
that 's a good point 
you 're probably right 
no i think i mean that 's that 's what it what it boils down to is people like to s- you know people say well i do n't want to be on jury you know 
i do n't want to serve on jury duty 
i do n't want to vote 
i do n't want to do this and that 
well then they could you know i put them in the reverse situation in the place where they do n't have the right to be on jury duty 
and and they do n't have the right to vote i suspect their opinions would change very quickly 
which 
and that was what i was thinking exactly about 
because in the soviet union they had an election 
and they had what like a ninety eight percent turnout 
yes 
a massive turnout 
at last someone wants us to vote 
they were standing in lines to vote 
yes 
they were they were doing that 
unfortunately what what they were they had they had no idea what they were voting on it turns out 
and their vote did n't count 
that 's right 
but but it 's the thought 
they all got out 
but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them are actually going to show up 
or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in russia 
or any one shows up 
right 
that that 's true 
total indifference you know 
what difference does it make 
back gone the full circle 
right 
now if things go the way that that that that they are there i think that they 'll keep voting 
but i think they 'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of only half of them will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement 
so you know i think i think that that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the are the ones who who are really out to make a statement because you know when when when you 've got an underdog candidate who represents something and even if he does n't win a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does i think make a statement to everyone else 
oh certainly there 's a message there even if they lose 
i think that yeah 
i think 
and i i think that 's real important 
oh and i think women turn out to vote for women too 
that 's probably true 
y- yeah 
i thin- 
well i know it 's true 
you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female 
she may lose 
but by golly we 're going to make a statement here you know 
yeah hum 
that 's good 
that 's tha- tha- that 's actually real good 
i said well well a- a- the the female who i would most rally behind right now right i do n't know much about her politics that 's about a way the way she makes speeches is a is a local person for you is ann richards 
oh okay 
i do n't know her politics 
i just know that uh i saw her speak in the eighty four democratic uh convention 
and right then and there if they said to me vote for someone for president i would have slapped down my vote for ann richards 
was was that the time 
no 
that was l- eighty four 
that 's too soon 
she said something about uh ginger rogers d- did everything fred astaire did 
and she did it backwards in high heels 
that 's very good 
she said that 
i did n't 
said you know do n't tell me what women can do 
that that 's that 's that 's very good 
that 's 
i i like that 
so i would uh i would i would vote for her 
without and i i suspect she could get a large voter turnout 
i think i did vote for her as a matter of fact 
i 'm pretty sure i did 
say i i i would think that um that that people like that i think in- inflammatory politicians are um or or emotional politicians you know certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out i think 
i would hope 
well and some of the issues are so emotional 
um-hum 
you know some of the really the really emotional ones 
have you followed the dallas elections on zoning 
no 
oh i 've heard of it 
but not necessarily 
i 've heard it 's very controversial though 
i 
everyone has made so many statements 
i do n't live in dallas county 
um-hum 
but i 've heard so many statements that i 've lost track 
hum 
i honestly at this point 
it 's it 's just too blown out of proportion for everyone 
you really 
even the news 
you can not follow what the sto- the actual facts are at this point 
yes 
um-hum that 's what 
i do n't i do n't really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided 
um-hum 
i wonder about them at some point 
hum hum 
hum well they 're elected as well 
so so so they 're going to be 
that 's correct 
and that 's an- and that 's another interesting question 
should judges be elected or appointed 
but that- that 's true 
that 's true 
well well in some sense they they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people 
are they politicians 
and you do n't want them to have you do n't want a judge to be appointed because you do n't want someone 's friend to be a judge 
sure 
but on the other hand 
or you want to take the other side of it you can argue 
that 's one of those you can pick either side and we could spend a lot of time on it because it 's it 's difficult 
right 
that 's right 
um-hum 
it 's situational really 
so how do you think we can get people to vote 
uh uh 
i 've had one idea that i think is is is completely undoable 
but it but i think 
i- b- but i suspect it would work 
and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else 
oh 
so given a choice between you know 
so 
so if you have 
so if if 
imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of um anti women statements anti semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera 
well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person 
but i suspect that that that would actually never work 
hum 
well this is true 
this is true 
i was worrying uh along the lines of you get everytime someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box a dollar bill comes out the bottom 
um-hum 
that 's an interesting notion 
that might work in some places 
that that that that that would be interesting 
yes 
i think that would work in some places 
yeah 
all right 
all right 
what are some of your favorite foods 
mine well 
i imagine with argentina you 've got some great foods 
yeah 
well we got um a lot of uh european dishes 
uh-huh 
well we got we got what some people call the best beef in the world 
yes 
so it 's uh bishu 
like every sunday you go out 
and you buy all these parts of the cow 
and then you just cook them over a grill 
that 's 
like in our house it 's already built in 
there 's this whole special place in the back 
so that you can make a barbecue 
uh i 've had i 've had that meal in new york uh where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued and it 's marvelous 
yeah 
yeah 
and then 
uh i have i have to find a place around here that has that 
well they have one in uh they have an argentinean place down in georgetown 
so 
okay 
i 'll keep that in mind yeah 
um 
you serve that yourself or the for a family 
uh excuse me 
you ever serve that yourself when you have company 
oh no 
well see what happens is i 'm only twenty two but like wh- like when i 'm down at home and like somebody says okay when are when are we having this you know 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and i 'll and i 'll cook it 
oh 
you know like you have to prepare the fire and then put the sausages on 
and then you know you put all these different meats which take different times 
that do you buy them um separately at you know an american grocery store now 
or do you have to 
or you do n't you do n't go buy it from a a wholesaler 
no 
but uh what happens is in argentina they have like all these little places like the fruit stand and you know the dairy and products and whatever 
little butcher shops yeah 
and so 
yeah 
i- i 've lived in mexico 
so i know 
and so they got they got the meat place 
yeah 
and so you just go there 
and you can n't find chicken there 
you got to go to another place to find the chicken 
yeah 
yeah you have to you have poultry place 
what do you what other what dishes do you serve with it 
well basically it 's what we call empanadas which is which is like 
yeah 
i the turnover 
the stuffed turnovers 
r- right 
meat turnovers 
oh i love those 
uh-huh 
and uh then we also put sausages on a bun 
and then that 's that 's to start out with 
yeah 
and then what you have is also like you know like three different kinds of salad 
uh-huh 
and uh that 's about it 
do you remember when you were in washington sam the argentine baker 
uh no 
it used to be in georgetown years ago 
he moved 
i guess he he retired and went back to argentina 
i guess in nine- the early seventies 
oh okay 
yes 
so that mu- that 's before your time 
yeah 
your parents might remember if they were here then 
no 
we we were only there for two years 
okay 
i mean he was wonderful 
i we used to get the most marvelous empenadas and other argentine things 
so yeah 
and uh what what i also eat now since i 'm in 
college i have an italian roommate 
and 
yeah 
i 'm italian 
are you 
uh-huh 
and since being argentinean we also have a lot of pasta 
yeah well 
and you know 
because there 're many italians in argentina 
like yeah 
and my mom you know like makes like what we call niokes and and all this stuff that it 's just you know everything like lasagna and everything 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
yeah 
my grandparents my grandfather came to the united states through argentina 
oh okay 
this was around the turn of the century actually actually a little bit later like nine- uh nineteen thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen 
yeah 
that 's 
a- at one point one third of the population of argentina was italian like pure italians 
yeah 
well i 'll tell you 
it 's interesting because when we cook here 
i 'm of italian descent 
my husband is chinese 
okay 
so we and we both love eu- continental cooking french cooking 
okay 
so we cook uh 
our meals are well 
we do n't d- we do n't usually mix 
i mean that 's well sometimes well if we 're entertaining we 'll do a chinese recipe and um there are really easy recipe 
right 
right 
that is you know with chinese you always have several dishes 
yeah 
and nowadays with microwaves 
you can steam many of the things in a microwave 
yeah 
i do n't know if you have one 
yeah 
and if you like chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done 
okay 
okay 
okay 
and it 's a wonderful um flavorful piece of fish 
is it 
yeah 
because i was uh you know 
it 's like when when you go buy fish you know like well like i buy like the fish 
um-hum 
that you can do in the microwave you know the breaded fish 
um-hum 
and you 
know i 've seen you know the filet 
yeah 
buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish mar- uh the fish counter 
what kind of fish 
um uh any white fish 
sole is good um um flounder sole or flounder is real good and even grouper 
okay 
so we put soy sauce and sesame 
little bit of soy sauce and sesa- sesame seed oil 
okay 
and not too much soy sauce 
uh some chopped up scall- um you know slivers of scallions and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes 
okay 
and if the fish flakes it 's done 
do n't overcook it though 
okay 
because i got i got um one of those little uh microwaves 
the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water 
yeah well till you just check it you know during 
yeah 
and another quick dish if you like um if do you know what hoi sin sauce is 
it 's that sweet chinese sauce 
no 
i do n't 
well if you go in a chinese store ask for hoi sin h o i s i n 
wait wait wait h 
h o i 
wait ah h o i 
s i n or s e n either way they 'll spell it hoi sin sauce 
s i n 
it 's a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown 
and if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in 
okay 
okay 
okay 
and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce that you can serve over rice 
okay how how much uh how much uh how much pork do you buy for two people 
um well 
for two people um ame- uh if it 's american style i 'd buy a half a pound if you know we if you 're just serving that 
but if you 're serving another dish with it say the rice dish um well with guys pretty healthy appetite i 'd probably go a third of a pound 
right 
and then you know you could 
yeah 
i cou- i could probably go half a pound 
and you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know 
so but there 's there 's just since i 'm from argentina i just love meat 
yeah 
and we 
you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef 
just okay 
just stir fry the ground beef 
drain off the oil 
use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables 
okay 
just stir that in 
and you 've got a very colorful side another dish 
and how much does it cost 
um the hoi sin sauce 
yeah 
oh a dollar twenty nine a can 
oh okay 
a can would serve would serve you for you know for quite a few um meals you know 
yeah 
okay 
i thought it maybe it was like you know like five fifty or something 
oh no 
no 
no 
no 
no 
it 's not it 's not expensive at all 
it 's o- it 's one of the chinese cooking basics 
so oh okay 
yeah 
well listen it was good talking with you 
same here 
hope you enjoy your recipe 
all right 
thank you 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay um well 
the first thing 
uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh information about selecting a school 
well first i think they 've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do 
uh-huh 
uh once they have that then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer 
yeah uh 
do you do you feel that the first two years that the um 
depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to the school that school all four years 
but i know there are some fields where it 's really not necessary 
um-hum yeah 
a lot fields are 
most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff are n't really concerned with your first two years anyway 
it 's it 's your core education your general requi- general education requirements 
uh-huh 
um if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i do n't i do n't know what advice i 'd give them 
go to the school you 'd like to go to 
yeah 
that 's what i did 
yeah 
i did n't care about the program or anything else 
i went where i wanted to go 
yeah 
what was your degree in 
uh political science 
political science oh 
okay 
well i kn- i know i 'm going to school right now 
and uh i have a friend 
where are you at 
uh utd 
university of texas dallas 
well yeah 
i guess everybody 's in dallas that i talk to 
i 'm in north carolina 
i know 
well that 's where texas instruments is 
yeah 
right 
um something that i i think that i 've noticed that 
i i have a friend 
i think if you 're going into like uh law or medicine a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public um institution 
sure 
and uh it 's a lot cheaper 
oh yeah 
my parents my parents made a mistake in uh in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years 
um 
and she found out after that 
she said you know my parents they just they really wasted a lot of money 
this is about twenty years ago 
uh-huh 
but uh well right now i just 
i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major 
yeah 
it does um 
i did n't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree 
uh-huh 
um originally i had planned uh undergrad degree in political science and then a master 's in public administration 
and i went ahead and pursued that 
i i got as far as the thesis and decided to hell with it 
i did n't want it 
um and from that point i went to law school 
um-hum uh-huh 
and after a year and a half of that i decided i did n't want that either 
okay 
have n't figured out what i want to be when i grow up 
yeah 
and so but i i i really did enjoy the law 
i mean that 's that 's where i wanted to be 
but i did n't want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney 
i just wanted a law degree 
uh-huh 
and i 've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field because that 's the nuts and bolts of the law and that 's what i like 
yeah 
and you do n't have to put up with all the b s that the lawyers have to 
right 
so that 's that 's what i 'm pursuing right now and i 'm pretty happy with it so far 
um 
yeah 
yeah 
i 'm i 'm pursuing what they what 's what 's called an interdisciplinary field 
i 'm a speech therapy major and fortunately i have a lot of i have a good medical background 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and 
that 's probably very useful 
yeah 
it 's it 's actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought 
uh-huh 
and um i also have a good languages background linguistics and some psychology 
uh-huh 
so it 's all working together 
yeah 
the only field i 'm not familiar with really is education which is required as well it requires about four or five different fields really 
yeah oh good grief 
so it 's a 
yeah 
yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher 
but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet 
uh-huh 
i said uh i could n't do this everyday 
no way 
um 
maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing 
oh so you are a disgruntled graduate student 
i am a dis- i am i am just a disgruntled person all around 
oh 
i 'm the uh i 'm the uh original uh mister scrooge i guess 
yeah 
bah humbug 
yeah 
bah humbug 
yeah 
i just 
i i i think 
yeah 
there is 
i i i think uh law would be a fine field a fine profession fine field to go into 
um i know one time i was in a political science class 
and you know talking about fields people going into different fields i made an off off the cuff remark about lawyers about uh their integrity being questionable 
and i mean oh that was like a can of worms 
oh you probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school 
no 
no there was a woman 
she said my my best friends are lawyers and you know all this 
and it was just 
well that remark in itself is a slam 
my best friends are lawyers 
yeah 
i know 
you know like like uh you know my best friends are blacks 
it was or or jewish 
it used to be jewish you know 
jewish 
now blacks and i guess i i guess uh iraqi now is the 
yeah 
i know 
it 
but 
law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school and it does n't become fun anymore 
yeah 
yeah 
i have a i have a friend 
she 's studying she 's going into law 
another friend going into law 
and that she 's 
i i i 'm really i 'm really concerned about you know 
she 's just going to be you know 
what 's going to happen when she gets there 
yeah 
you going 
you know all of her dreams will be dispelled 
oh yeah 
yeah 
if if if you 've ever seen the program paper chase it 's very much like that except worse 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's i i think it 's probably more embarrassing and very painful 
it is 
i i see i see that happening 
yeah 
very much so 
yeah 
it 's it 's a lot of that um it it was enjoyable for a while um 
yeah 
but it 's such a grind and you begin to wonder you know 
yeah 
if if i 'm not i mean 
you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it 
uh-huh 
if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it 
um-hum 
i mean i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard 
and i aged ten years 
uh-huh 
but i i i would n't trade the experience for anything in the world 
i mean it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law 
yeah 
i i went to a language school 
and and that was a it was a an i guess uh united states institution 
it was i was military at the time 
and i i think probably the biggest 
what branch were you in 
huh 
what branch were you in 
i was in the air force 
i was too 
yeah 
yeah 
for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine 
it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with 
yeah yeah well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean 
it 
i had a terrific job really enjoyed it 
yeah 
yeah well what was your job 
uh uh command post 
uh i was i was a linguist 
i was just wondering were you in sac by any chance 
hum 
were you in sac 
in tac 
sac 
uh no 
i was n't 
oh okay 
i i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the uh r c one thirty fives 
no 
no 
i did n't i did n't go flight crew 
matter of fact i did n't make it completely through that through that field 
i was i was in intelligence school and about three weeks short 
oh 
i did n't make -t 
i sort of washed out 
well 
that 's 
yeah 
after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it 's it 's something you know 
uh-huh 
i think that 's why you know children really need to think about the field they 're going to going into and i mean spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about 
yeah 
yeah 
they actually should do some reading and they should study it 
that 's right 
and it and if it 's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it 
yeah 
i i i i i think i think there 's a lot to be said for kids working after school 
uh-huh 
sure 
i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are 
that 's true 
i found that out when i was in high school 
i worked at mcdonald 's 
yeah oh and i tell you what 
i worked at mcdonald 's as well 
and i i can tell you one thing 
there are just some people that i you know 
you just came to the point where i mean 
and oh i eventually worked in a lab in a la- as a lab technician 
and i worked front desk 
and i mean somebody could walk in the door 
and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say 
yeah 
yeah 
i was the same way too 
i 'm not a people person 
i i i hate um having to play such a nice guy you know especially when it 's all phony especially when you got some uh jerk coming in 
yeah 
um-hum 
uh-huh 
i 
it 's just not for me 
i 'm uh i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that which is why i 'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot 
um-hum 
yeah 
that 's good 
i was just wondering um getting back to the school thing so i mean i i- i almost wish that there was some 
so um well i 'll tell you my situation is uh i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home 
and um her son which is my father is also elderly 
and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years 
now my father 's almost eighty 
my grandmother 's almost ninety seven 
jeez 
so um it 's strange because it it so hit so close to home but um um 
my father 's an only child 
and really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother 
she had many sisters 
and a couple of them took care of her 
and then one her last sister died 
and it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was and plus she was driving my father crazy 
she went through three housekeepers live-in housekeepers 
so she 's kind of cranky to get along with 
there 's nothing physically wrong with her except she 's very very old 
but her personality is is very grating 
i mean i hope i do n't get like that when i get old 
so 
yes 
i 'm i 'm i have some great concerns about uh m- my parents and my relatives reaching that age 
um around here where i live in maryland in the washington area there 's there 's 
and uh i used to live down in dallas 
there was just so many stories about uh rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions 
in fact here in baltimore they 've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all the people out of them because they were so uh bug infested and rat infested 
and 
it i- you know really concerns me that um first of all that anyone could let someone live like that 
but if you have to you know how do you make sure 
i mean i 'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face um you know 
how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is 
because once you put someone into there you know they may not like the fact that they 've been put in there 
and they might complain about the place all the time even though it 's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there 
and you know 
yeah 
you do n't know if their complaints are legitimate 
yeah 
um we do n't have that problem up here 
we might maybe in a rural uh 
maybe there 's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area 
but it would be a very small one 
um the one my grandmother 's in is very um hospital like 
there were some really nice ones here 
all the a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations 
um this one is more or less for someone who who 's poor and can n't go there 
and my father 's is 
he 's no by no means wealthy 
but he 's quite well off 
uh-huh 
and he could he could easily have put her into a nicer um home 
but up here there 's waiting lists 
and that was the first one that opened 
and i suggested to him why do n't you change 
um he said well these people here are they are very nice to her 
and he was saying his excuses 
if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice 
so the the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it 's a really trying job 
i mean i go up twice a week to see my grandmother 
and i know the staff very well 
so they could n't they can n't hide anything on you or anything like that 
uh-huh 
but i have heard of really awful conditions especially down the southern part of the st- the country which is 
yes uh 
that 's true 
my uh my grandmother 's um 
last time my mother went down there to visit the the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches that uh she even ha- you know they went in and she had roaches crawling on her 
there were roaches even in her alarm clock 
um 
oh that 's terrible 
yes 
it was absolutely horrible 
they took her immediately out of there 
and they just threw everything away that that she had from there 
i mean they would n't even take the uh the uh the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just you know full of bugs 
they just left everything and uh bought her all brand new stuff 
and they they had called a home where they you know where they were on a waiting list to get into there and explained to the uh person that was in charge you know what had happened and that they had ta- they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions 
and amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening 
and they they put her into that opening 
well that 's good 
so is your grandmother um impaired 
is she of alzheimer 's or something like that 
i 'm not sure um what exactly is wrong with her 
um up until nineteen eighty two uh 
actually i 'm sorry not until 
yeah 
i guess it was around eighty two eighty three i found out i had a grandmother 
oh 
prior to that i was told that she was dead 
and um apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who um put her into a mental institution 
oh that does happen 
yeah 
and uh you know it was a real hush hush thing and then i was i was wondering why my mother always referred to you know his second wife as that hussy 
yep 
you know my neighbors across the street their uh mother was sick at times 
and they they could n't handle her 
so they put her in a home 
and then uh the old frenchman he 'd get a little drunk look round at his kids oh you still need your mother 
i guess i 'll look after her 
an- and that what happens a lot when when people are sick or they just real manic depressants they end up being put in homes 
and it 's like oh well 
yeah 
but that 's it 's it 's 
i 'm really glad that i come from an area where um that there 's good people in the homes 
but it 's just as 
it does n't matter if it is like you say the best place 
they still do n't want to go to these homes 
and my grandmother 's real 
there i mean she cries every day 
this has been over a year 
and she tries to make me feel really guilty 
but i have to you know i have to put my foot down where where my life begins 
i mean if that was my mother i would really f- i feel a lot more responsible 
i would probably take care of my mother 
i do n't really um 
when my father when something 
if anything happens to him i do n't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i do n't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home 
and hopefully that he he can uh get along with uh in-house help 
so he he 's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will uh be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day because i think that 's the best situation is when you 're you get that old and you 've been independent your whole life you do n't want to go into a home because uh like i say my father 's eighty 
and he 's really active 
he still has his driver 's license here 
i mean you would n't believe what he does 
he actually tows cars 
and as the years got on the tow trucks got better there easier 
and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one 
so he wo n't have to do very much work 
an- so someone like that they i really do n't want to see them go in a home 
he 's got two li- dogs that are his constant companions 
and he always replaces them 
you know i 've had like over the past thirty years i 've had you know about seven or eight different dogs all the time 
and there all you know it 's like oops dad 's got these two 
and the old one dies 
and the young one goes for a while 
and he gets another one 
so i can n't see him with- without his animals 
even though it 's very expensive to stay at home mentally it 's just the best thing for you 
yes 
you know 
i mean when you get on in your years it 's the only thing you really have 
and i 'm thinking when i get older i i i think if i brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home 
i- i do n't want to be a s- selfish you know a burden on anyone 
that 's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through 
and i 'm and i 'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place i mean 
and of course it 's institutional food 
and everybody hates it 
and it 's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight 
yeah 
it it 's really it 's bad thing 
but when they go into the homes they lose weight and li- because of the institutional food you know 
i think it 's fine 
but you know my taste um buds are pretty uh flexible 
and here they are they 're always used to these old fashioned foods 
they 're really set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home 
and now they 're feeding them um quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat 
uh-huh yeah 
just 
they do n't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that 
that 's that 's the thing my grandmother really misses i mean really growls about 
yeah 
my mother has made similar statements that she does n't want to become a burden to the family 
you know just put me out to pasture or shoot me or something you know there are the lines that come from her 
and uh and i tell her you know no problem mom 
always got a place for you 
but uh 
yeah 
i know 
if if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the the in-law apartment and have it on you know one floor and really easy access 
uh-huh 
well that 's what i 'm telling my father now 
he needs a new floor in his bathroom 
and i says now is the time 
redo your whole bathroom 
so you can get in and out 
okay 
have you ever served as a juror 
never 
i 've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors 
uh-huh 
i never have either 
you have n't huh 
if you were uh what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers 
well i think it 's a good idea 
i think our justice system needs a major overhaul 
and i 'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it 
but i think they 've got a lot of problems 
i think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial 
true 
and i do n't know if that 's just a pure volumes number or or what 
but uh sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined 
and they 're too easily swayed by their emotion 
yeah 
i think that 's true 
hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides tv shows 
yeah 
do you would you prefer all trials by a judge 
no 
i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty 
but as far as the aff- aff- affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature i do n't know if that is best left up to the jury to de- to award you know 
two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know it it 's true that you know this may be sad and all that thing 
but uh the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of of penalties and fines and punishment 
yeah 
i would agree with that 
i think you 're right 
i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it 's only going to cost the insurance company 
and 
um-hum 
that 's true 
but uh i do like the idea of the jury being the the the people who decide in the matter of uh if it 's a jail term versus life and death you know the death penalty and such 
uh-huh 
if they give them all the information 
i do n't know 
when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff 
uh-huh 
sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury 's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave 
and the judge decides whether or not they should hear it 
right 
yeah 
uh it it it 's kind of difficult 
and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail although you still hear about those occasionally 
right 
yeah 
do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury 
um i do n't know 
i you know i heard a very interesting 
and maybe it 's just the tv show or movie i was watching 
they were going through a trial 
and i think it was like on one of the the documentary tv shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and they took it more as just like a majority 
oh 
so i- i 
some of them disagree 
i mean some of them said one way and some the other 
exactly 
but they took you know whatever the majority was 
so i did n't know if that was just something for drama or that 's truly the way it is 
i always thought it had to be unanimous 
i think it does have to be unanimous 
but uh rather interesting 
i know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was 
but i thought that they all had to agree 
or else they it was a hung jury 
uh-huh 
and 
i did i did also 
yeah 
i thi- i do n't know how i feel about that 
i think maybe uh majority might be sufficient 
uh-huh 
it 's hard to say though 
what about in international trials 
do you think they should have a jury there 
i oh 
i think that would be kind of interesting 
yeah 
i had n't thought about international trials at all 
i guess the the problem with that is there 's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts like you know the old day with the rack 
right 
we they 're going to say okay you 're guilty and you have to pay kuwait four million dollars 
well whose going to really make them 
yeah 
nobody 
yeah 
so but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know people from different countries uh in as international law also 
yeah 
i think maybe they 'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average joe off the street for something like that because of the cultural differences things like that 
um-hum 
right 
i do n't know how what it what it would take to be come up with a true perfect system or if one exists 
but 
yeah 
what about uniform sentencing right 
uh is that the crime 
and it 's already false due to some chart and determine the punishment 
or 
yeah 
like if you 're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years 
it 's not a discretionary thing 
um-hum 
i think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh i guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature 
i 
yeah 
i wish that when they sentence someone if they 're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years 
yeah 
that serves a kind of if they 're i guess uh 
if you sentence someone to life life is only forty nine years something like that 
you know yeah 
i 
and i guess you 're eligible after twenty seven for parole even though you 're in for life 
yeah 
and sometimes those people are are young enough they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble 
yeah 
although i guess it 's your you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time 
yeah 
i do n't believe that very often happens 
no 
because uh inside the jail there i do n't think there 's no real rehabilitation 
i do n't think so either 
in fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad 
it 
just yes it 's another war zone 
yeah 
but who knows 
i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know 
i agree 
get them out there 
actually make them do something that 's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them 
and 
sure 
they should have them go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state 
yeah 
since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of kind of work out of them 
yeah 
something besides license plates and tiddlywinks 
exactly 
yeah 
trading their lives for cigarettes those kinds of things 
yeah 
well good 
well i think that covers it 
i think so 
it was nice talking to you 
nice talking to you also 
um bye 
have a wonderful easter 
you too 
bye 
bye 
well how many credit cards do you have 
um i 've only i 've got about four maybe 
i try to limit them because i well one i do n't use them uh too much 
and i use my visa just for abou- for about everything 
and i pay it all off 
so i try not to 
i just use it for free money for thirty days basically 
sounds like we have no conflict 
we had 
for a while i was carrying one card 
and my wife was carrying a different one 
and since the slips all look alike uh you commingle them 
and then you get the statement 
and you try to sort them out and 
it and it uh it it causes more confusion about it 
i finally said gee this is kind of a waste of time 
and then when at&t came along and offered a free one uh i accepted that 
and we 've been using that one 
uh the interesting thing is is that uh the amount of money you can can run up on them 
i do n't know 
do you know any people that run up big big bills 
i 'm i 'm you know i 'm in the age group you get out of college 
and i think a lot of these people have them maxed out 
well did um were you able to get one while you 're in college 
um i do n't think i ever tried 
just curious because i have a son that 's a senior this year 
and he 's heading off with any kind of luck 
but there has been 
i 've had a couple of ads for a for for to provide a card for a college student 
uh what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that 
um well 
yeah 
i i you know 
it 's you know feasible 
i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but just depends 
well that that that i guess from the from the card issuer uh that 
since since it 's it 's in mo- the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that 's responsible 
but it 's 
yeah 
so basically if you want to take the risk 
yes 
it 's whether the parent wants to take the risk 
it 's your risk 
do you trust your your son 
yeah 
to to go run up a big bill 
and the thing is there some there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded 
uh-huh 
i i 'm i 'm leaning towards doing it for for conven- a convenience 
uh-huh 
i 'd say do you know have one with you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something 
yeah 
and the idea that you know if he got in trouble there 's some some ways of getting out and that he does n't have to carry cash 
the uh 
i i like the idea of credit cards that uh i do n't i do n't i do n't carry cash around and and uh i do n't even carry checks around 
i let my wife take the checkbook 
a- she writes the checks 
and i record them 
so it 's uh it 's uh it 's but it 's interesting that uh the people that can that can uh the amounts of money you can run up wi- on on credit cards 
and uh i i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that 
they had run up he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer 
and he had run up uh more than a years salary in in various debts to 
and he wound up declaring bankruptcy 
but there 
it it 's hard to believe that you 'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of uh 
well it was a combination of things he had 
yeah uh-huh 
uh there were there were several credit cards 
and then there were several other businesses 
but uh i i guess what 's interesting have you seen the uh the the the the ads where they 're offering to extend payments on uh things like uh like the credit union 's offering 
the the extended loan payment for your car 
yes 
yeah 
yeah 
i saw that 
the interesting thing about that is is that uh that that they 're encouraging you to incur more incur more debt 
and 
well it 's it 's it 's business 
and they 're making money off that 
and they make more money if you extend your loan 
yeah 
and and it 's so it 's business 
so and you notice that they 're they 're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old 
yes 
and so they 've already shifted the risk 
if they assume that car then they just have to sell it themselves 
and they 'll recover the loan 
and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely dire circumstances or 
any- they 're not going to keep on if the car were older 
uh-huh 
the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics 
i i thinks it 's i think it 's poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint 
yeah 
so it 's interesting that that the american public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible 
and this year it 's ten percent or so 
yeah 
uh 
it 's uh it 's interesting that that uh they encourage us to do things 
what now what 's ten percent we can deduct 
i think ten percent 
yes 
i did n't know that 
of your of your consumer credit 
oh if you had a thousand dollars that means there 's another hundred dollar deduction i 've given you 
i did n't think you could 
anything on a loan or i mean a mortgage i know you can 
yeah 
it 's on uh yeah 
yeah 
on the uh 
there 's there 's there 's a place for consumer debt 
and then you take ten percent of it 
on the 
oh i 've never itemized yet 
oh okay 
so maybe that 's schedule a or 
it 's on it 's on schedule um schedule a under uh 
well it 's the same place it 's the same place you put uh interest 
but but see that 's what that 's what makes texas squirrelly laws that uh you can n't you can n't take out a a second mortgage uh like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that 
and so uh it 's fully deductible 
the laws are a little squirrelly 
but it basically comes down to 
it 's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint 
yeah 
but uh anyway 
yeah 
i try i i really do i just try to stay out of debt 
and i and i use my visa for for as much as i can 
and i pay it all off 
and 
sounds like you 're you 're very respon- very financially responsible 
it 's uh that 's uh 
uh-huh 
there 're a lot of people who really run 
my boss drives quite a ways to work 
and he 's got just enormous debts 
and he 's 
uh but i mean what do you say it 's like shucks boss i 'm sure sorry you 've got all that debt 
well he 's had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing 
and that i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts 
uh-huh 
and but i agree with you i do n't i try to limit my debts 
yeah 
well i did buy a new house last summer 
yeah and i took a five year note out on my car when i right when i got out of college 
and uh i 'll never do that again 
i still got a couple of years on it to go 
and i 'm 
that it 's it 's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car 
and that uh apparently that 's been going on for a really long time 
i did n't do it 
i i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year 
uh-huh well you you think you 're starting out well until you start paying all those bills uh apartment rent 
yep 
and 
miscellaneous things like food -nd and other things 
yeah 
these habits you get into eating 
and and uh it 's it 's it 's amazing how it what you learn 
well yeah and an- yeah 
so 
well anything else good to say about credit cards 
um yeah they 're they 're convenient you know 
i might just 
that 's that 's a probably one big thing about them 
and uh 
you do n't have to carry the cash 
and and uh and it 's it 's it 's certainly accepted more places than the places you know 
it 's hard to cash a check if you 're out of state 
and 
uh-huh yeah 
well i was used to using my credit card like at skaggs alpha beta in dallas and stuff and now i 'm out here in phoenix 
yeah 
they do n't allow they do n't do tha- 
uh they they 
none of these grocery stores take any credit cards 
so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store which is new to me you know 
i got to have sixty bucks on me or something 
yeah 
so uh that was interesting cause i always you know 
huh carry all that cash with you 
you did n't have to worry about carrying that much unless i knew i 
well you know they they they 've started towards a little bit of the debit card 
have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you 
yeah 
i 've heard about them 
yeah 
and i think that 's where 
that 's mostly locally 
the banks will line up with uh 
yeah 
i 've seen a couple 
although the 
so many of the grocery stores do n't do that because of the the time frame which they get paid in general 
that uh 
they 
i 've seen checks deposited the very next day i mean cleared my account the next day 
my wife will write a check for groceries 
and you know almost 
well i guess it 's the day after uh 
technically it 's two days 
but the- the- they took that check and scurried it to the bank 
and the bank scurried it back to my account 
and you thought there 'd be just a little bit of float 
but apparently that 's why the uh the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high 
and they have uh 
the profitability of the cash flow is a big issue for them 
yeah 
so anyway 
well it 's good talking to you 
all righty 
maybe we 'll get across we 'll cross paths again 
good night 
all righty 
take it easy 
well i i do n't think that it 's it 's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions 
for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there 's where there 's uh endangerment to their own life and other people 's lives 
all right i agree with that 
people that are uh driving like uh truck drivers and things like that 
um-hum 
i definitely think they should be tested 
and and i 'm not i 'm not opposed to any testing 
i mean because i know i certainly would n't want to uh you know be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or you know because he was on drugs while he was there 
um-hum yeah 
uh 
well how do you f- how do you feel about uh companies drug testing prior to hiring 
oh um i was tested uh within my company 
i think it 's i- i- kind of a push to uh weed out drugs in states 
and because i do n't know of any other countries that are doing this and i f- i feel like it 's really just within the united states 
um-hum 
it 's um it 's okay 
i think your record should stand for itself that you know if you 've been tested at other companies and you 've always come up negative or whatever then i do n't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over 
um-hum 
and once you 've established the fact that you 're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you 're not i think they could uh save money by not doing that you know every time 
say if you change jobs th- you would n't have to do it if you 'd just been tested at your other work place 
um-hum well what about random testing though 
oh 
d- do you feel like that 's an in- invasion of certain people 's rights if not everyone is tested 
r- uh not if it 's done fairly 
and that 's probably my question is how how do you know it 's done fairly 
i do n't know that you do 
if it 's random then it 's random and that 's not necessarily fair 
yeah 
well they might tell you it 's random 
um-hum 
but then you know it 's kind of like a a lottery 
somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person does n't win anything and tries and tries and tries you know 
yeah 
well i ha- i know that for instance in the nc double a they drug test 
and it 's not random 
oh i see 
how 'd how did they how do they pick their people 
um well i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season and from that point on uh at the nc double a does have something to do with it 
uh-huh 
but it 's almost discretionary on the coach 's part of each in- individually individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem 
oh i see 
so do you 
a- and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time 
right 
well do you think that should be implemented in the work place you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs 
do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested 
well not being a drug user i do n't have a problem with that personally but i think that might be a violation of someone 's rights 
right 
if someone 's having personal problems for some reason that 's causing them to ha- behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset 
right 
right 
right 
yeah 
it would almost be like a a uh 
it 's an accusation 
and and it 's and it 's b- based on on uh perception that someone has of how a drug user would behave when some drugs users behave uh normal uh you know 
uh-huh 
right and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and you know your supervisor has accused you of using drugs 
right 
exactly 
i- it i do n't the i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it 's across the board from from the janitors to the executive management 
right 
i agree with that 
because i know personally myself i 've been in the same job for three years 
it 'll be three years in august 
and i 've already been drug tested three times 
um-hum what type of job do you have 
well i 'm an environmental engineer and i 've been drug tested three times 
uh-huh 
and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime 
and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus 
so see i i for some reason i 've come up three times 
that 's pretty high statistics 
well does your j- re- does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might en- endanger someone 
no 
no 
not at all 
well it that does n't 
i- i mean i- i 
i- it 's a legal job you know so see it 's really strange 
uh-huh 
hum that is odd 
i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job uh 
but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well 
the job i have have now requested my uh uh my uh medical record from my old company so i do n't know if i was n't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me did n't request the drug test because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion 
oh uh-huh 
right 
well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for bef- before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we 've already drug tested her 
and and she came up negative 
well no 
i do n't think they can they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i i did n't i mean 
yeah 
th- they do n't know that i do n't use drugs 
they just tested me once 
right 
right 
but i used to work for a power company 
so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen uh were clean 
yeah uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and since i was just you know one of the office folk i guess it was n't as important to them that they test me regularly 
but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly re- uh just across the board 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and are they tested random 
no 
they 're 
all of them are tested once every three mo- 
they 're 
it 's a rotation 
oh okay 
i see 
but it 
but again it depends on what job you 're in 
yeah 
the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot 
and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines are n't tested as much 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but but see they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the what the drug testing schedule is 
oh i see 
they say we we 're testing you tomorrow 
and we 'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here 
uh-huh 
okay 
so they know that 
and they 
yeah 
it 's it 's made very clear upon hiring 
uh-huh 
okay 
well 
well have we spent our at least five minutes 
yeah i think so 
okay 
yeah 
seven 
okay 
twenty five 
okay 
nice speaking to you 
nice to talk to you 
too bye-bye 
o- bye 
it 's it 's hard to- topic because 
is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job 
and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do 
yeah 
and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or state school 
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school 
okay 
but you 're excluding high-level education 
yes 
well yeah 
i am um 
okay 
act- actually i think that i at the higher level education 
i do n't think there 's so much of a problem there 
it 's pretty much funded well 
there are small colleges that i 'm sure are struggling 
but uh it 's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours 
our school 
even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in new york city or washington dc uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child 
i would n't let them go to a public school system there 
but of course people are trapped economically 
and they can n't do that 
yeah 
i know down here the school 's are you know 
i do n't know 
they rate 
i moved to arkansas and texas after living in ohio 
and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country 
and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why 
because they 're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers do n't know what 's going on 
well that 's really too bad because i- it it 's giving some people unfair advantage 
i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in florida what we learned 
right 
well that was my experience going through junior high up there 
when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i 'd already done because we were so far advanced 
yeah 
and uh the you know i 'd been in a parochial school before junior high 
and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools 
yeah 
so you know i- i like the concept they 've got now where they have more directed education you know 
you you pick a career path 
or you get counseling earlier 
and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over 
oh they they have that down there that 
well they talk about it 
and there are a few in some of the more like in 
i live in a big metroplex 
and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools 
but uh you know 
yeah 
it 's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you 're really interested in that 
there 's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school 
right 
or if you 're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art 
you know there 's no point in you know 
i 'm an engineering student 
and if i have to go take art classes you know i 'm not going to use them 
and through high school i could have gone so much further if i 'd gone to a school that was directed 
yeah 
that 's where 
i was fortunate 
i 'm a i 'm a technician 
and we had a vocational um electronics in our high school 
right 
in high school 
so when i went to my first year of tech school uh i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program 
right 
i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they 're just overrun you know 
they do n't know what to do 
there 's too many kids and not enough teachers 
and too many kids do n't care 
yeah 
i find that that the that in the in the cities it 's more less the kids go there to socialize not really to learn 
and 
right 
and the parents send them there because they 're supposed to 
and plus it gets them out of their hair 
and i also find that that you can send a kid to school 
but if do n't work with them as a parent i think you 're putting your child at a big disadvantage 
yeah 
and you know there 's some kids that you know want to go learn 
but most of them just want to go play 
yeah 
well i could i could see if a kid does n't have any encouragement if they 're you know come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about trying to work 
and or maybe they 're unemployed 
and they 're mad at the world 
i can see where that would n't be very good for a a kid you know 
he 's coming up will you help me with my homework 
and they 're no get away from me 
i 've had a terrible day 
so it 's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from 
yeah 
that 's true 
i 'm wondering with the boom down here 
it 's well not at the moment 
but a lot of the industry 's moving southward 
yes 
are they going to move to uh mexico 
so 
oh i do n't know about that 
but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south and i 'm wondering if that 's going to have any effect you know on what you see now 
we 're we 're we 're behind down here 
i say we because i live here 
if 
that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years 
yeah 
maybe the maybe they 'll bring their good schools with them you know 
if the industry comes hopefully they 'll promote good schools 
yeah 
because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large ibm plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one 
and plus for for the type of student that 's going to that school it 's going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists 
right 
they 're they 're you 're most likely to do better in school 
they 're going to help you 
you hope 
yeah 
you hope 
well i think 
i- i do n't know 
i just think it it 's it 's a duty of the parent to do that 
i mean jeez my parents always helped me 
and i do n't know 
it 's just like you say 
it 's the way you 're raised and the economic situation you 're in 
i can see some lady 
she 's twenty one years old 
and she 's got four kids 
a kid in 
her first grader 
i do n't see where she 's going to have much time for him 
so i do n't know 
it 's just like 
i guess you just have to wonder 
is it up to the 
is it you know 
who whose supposed to make the change the the state the govern- the federal government you know 
where 's the money supposed to come from 
is it you know what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got 
i do n't know 
actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and t- to see what they need and not overinflate it 
like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you 're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute 
yeah 
we 're in a recession here 
we uh our town did n't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession 
and they 're 
even though we 've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years 
now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five 
people are going whoa 
yeah 
so 
starts hitting closer to home 
yeah 
but i always see it 's all it 's all money 
this 
like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime 
it it 's it 's all money based 
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level 
and and then if you 're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school 
who knows 
bu- 
maybe we do we need some more catholic schools 
support the church instead 
they seem to have done a the good job in the past 
in uh some places uh you could n't go to a public school 
it was miles down the road 
and the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the catholic school 
so 
yeah 
they 're a lot more strict 
yeah 
the i do n't 
you uh have to learn 
you are n't given the chance to you know screw off all the time 
yeah 
i do n't know if i would do that to my child though 
but so hum pretty much though 
see i do n't have any good ideas or or anything that would contribute 
see this is n't a subject that i think a lot about because i 'm never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job 
well i know i 'm in the you know 
the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the university of texas the education i 'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school 
is it 
i- i do n't think i 'm getting what i should 
but you know in texas it 's next to free because th- they pay so much of it 
it 's state supported 
well that 
but at the same time it 's really not it 's not like going to mit 
my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of mit 
and that 's it 's really too bad but that 's 
well 
i do n't know 
i think it just builds on the foundation that they 've already built 
you get people out of high schools and col- junior colleges that do n't have the background for an mit kind of curriculum 
so 
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school 
we have a very good public school up here 
and a degree out there means a lot 
it 's a very good school 
it 's it 's university of vermont 
um we also have some two year college 
well there 's a four year colleges 
they all have a pretty good reputation 
but like you say you 
all righty 
so uh do you think russia 's still a threat 
well i guess i 'm maybe naive 
but i never did feel that russia was a big threat to us 
there you go 
i mean obviously there 's the the the possibility of or was the possibility of war uh 
but i somehow think that war is one of those things that that maybe is inevitable 
but uh i do n't look at it as a threat in the same sense that that i think this question was meant 
what about you 
well i think 
h- have you ever read the book nineteen eighty four 
yes 
okay 
you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other right 
uh-huh 
and you could picture it as being russia versus the us d- during the whole time 
right 
and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know 
the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country 
right 
and you did n't want that to happen 
and to me it had always been that way 
i mean what happens is you have a government right 
and this government controls everything right and then you have the people inhabiting the country 
yeah 
and these people have nothing to do with the government itself 
right 
and these people are the same as you are 
right 
and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly us or russia attacks a country it 's not going to be within the borders of the us or russia itself 
like i was telling people i 'm really mad because the whole thing in the middle east this was going on 
in lith- in lithuania they they were announced to be a separate country 
but yet the the government that 's in moscow told its army to go in there and get those people 
and the us did n't go in there and try to save those people 
right 
you know it 's like you 're not going to go in there and say no 
listen 
there 's a separate country 
why 
because you 're going into the border 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
right 
once you get into the border then there 's a threat 
but what happens is you do n't mess with us we wo n't mess with you 
but let 's mess with the neutral countries 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
you know and now it 's like you know they 're saying other people were were i guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know like other people 
you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there 
but russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and the us has 
you know it 's like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
you know but i think i think the thing is is that there the thing 
like they were saying they go you know 
like libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button but not the ussr 
right 
the ussr would n't do it because they got too much at stake 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but i guess there was concern uh that i- iraq would use you know nonconventional warheads with with the chemical weapons and things 
but yet it did n't happen 
yeah 
i mean why not 
well my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on iraq if they had 
i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used that would have meant a total attack of the iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot 
uh-huh 
oh so you think it was fear that kept iraq from using it 
right 
but yet the 
and what happens is what happens is 
suppose they get saddam hussein which they eventually will 
he 's got one less thing to go against him 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
i mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he 's going to be captured and you know 
uh-huh 
but the us also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay 
if you give up then you can come live in our country 
and we 'll take care of you like marcos right 
right 
we 'll overthrow you 
but yet you can still come live here you know 
right 
i do n't think we 've done that to saddam hussein yet 
uh no 
no 
i think that 's that 's that 's not very likely 
but yet you know as as the parallel with russia is that saddam hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people 
yeah 
and i guess that makes sense what you said that uh within their own borders they feel freer to do what what they feel necessary 
right 
right 
yeah 
and uh you know there 's there 's just you know 
like people will go like they like the u s goes and goes into panama 
and what 
see i do n't believe in war 
that 's my thing 
i do n't believe that anybody should die you know 
uh-huh 
and so then you know you have 
because what happens is 
suppose i 'm i go to war 
and i 'm holding a gun 
and i 'm just looking at myself holding a gun 
and whoever shoots first survives you know 
but that same person also has a family 
and you know his parents are going to cry 
right 
and you know life ends there 
and to me that 's ridiculous 
you know i mean i just do n't believe it 
i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there are n't 
but it 's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down 
and it 's legal in a situation like that 
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well or that at that it resolves anything in the end that that negotiations could n't resolve 
you know 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean i mean saddam hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous 
and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so and keep his power 
uh-huh 
but well 
uh-huh uh-huh well it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the soviet union is a real threat to the us 
no 
i i do n't think so 
i think uh and they 're getting they 're especially getting their life back together now 
because a lot of things that you saw on tv 
a lot of uh inhabitants of russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to 
a lot of like dancers and stuff like that 
right 
they said that they would n't leave russia unless russia told them that they could n't travel anymore and compete 
so it must be a beautiful country 
uh-huh 
it 's just that you know they wo n't let you get out 
and when you want to get out of the country that 's what you want to do 
uh-huh right 
right 
so oh well 
i got to go to class now 
okay 
well thanks 
nice talking to you 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
okay um 
why do you think it um failed 
do you think we should adopt it 
okay no 
i do n't like the metric system 
you do n't 
i- i- i think the country is is um too ingrained in the inches and and just the general um background 
the history of our country has been inches 
and i do n't think there 's a big advantage in going to the metric system 
um-hum 
it it 's going to disorient it and confuse a lot of people for years and years 
and there are going to be people who die because of it because they do n't understand um you know simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is 
yeah 
and it 's it 's not in our national consciousness to do it 
we 've always measured things in the english system and you know everything you know 
yeah 
our land is in acres 
our people are n't going to understand what an amount of something is 
right 
yeah 
i a- i agree with you 
i do n't think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system 
i do n't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the the disadvantages that would happen to the people of america and also the um 
yeah 
i do n't know 
it seems almost like there 's this it 's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we 'll look good to the other nations 
because i think they that 's an area that the other nations especially europe look down on us like oh we 're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who have n't really attained it yet 
and i feel it 's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us 
and it 's like hey we 're content with this 
no 
it 's probably not as accurate 
probably you know intellectually does n't 
it 's not as sound intellectually but like you said i mean come on 
i had six years of college 
and i do n't know the metric system and i do n't care to learn it and i 'm not some kind of an idiot 
i mea- it 's yeah 
i just 
and it 's easy to trans- 
we have a computer for just about everything now 
and if it 's necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done because i 'm a mechanical engineer 
yeah 
and i 've had to work when i was designing packages for people 
i mean i had to to work both systems back and forth 
um-hum 
and it was not hard 
and you get you can get a cad cam system that can take any design you want 
and you can push a button 
and it 'll convert every measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds 
right 
there 's a lot of people 
like you 're educated 
i 'm educated 
my husband is 
but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated 
and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that does n't have any college 
really 
or i do n't know how much of the you know 
yeah 
but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they do n't have any college probably much at all 
absolutely 
and if we can n't take it and use it easily well we how can you put that on like elderly people and you know just people that maybe just are n't blessed with as as much sharpness and men- mental acuity 
oh yeah 
it 's just 
or or even have had the ability you know the chance to to go to college or to to to learn about 
yeah 
it i think it 's still good they do cover the system 
and i think it should still be taught in schools 
yeah 
and they do 
i know now because i 
even when i was in elementary school years ago they were you know we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements and things like that 
um-hum 
right 
yeah 
and and that 's acceptable 
yeah 
i think it failed too 
because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous 
i think americans have so much stress on them right now 
because yeah 
i mean if you look at the average family it 's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they 're really getting and do all this 
really 
and it 's like i mean come on let 's take the pressure 
ye- you know you need twenty gallons but do you need how many liters 
off yeah 
and it 's just like another thing the american family does n't need any more pressure 
yeah 
just leave them alone 
let them measure their green bean water in cups 
and leave them alone 
yeah 
and it it just does n't yeah it does n't make that much difference in the average life 
in the scientific community and places where it 's needed you know that 's fine 
i do n't know yeah 
and the rest of the world i mean we are 
uh w- if not 
we may not be the top 
i do n't know if we 're the top 
we 're one of the superpowers of the world 
uh-huh 
that 's 
it may be arrogant 
but i mean let them come to us 
that 's kind of the way i feel about it 
we can convert 
and and if they do n't like the way we do it just get off our do n't worry about it and i think 
yeah 
it it 's kind of like e- expecting everyone to suddenly speak german you know 
right 
it is because it is another language 
yeah 
yeah 
and and instead of having the world speak german we found out that we can translate 
and that 's what i think we ought to do with the metric system 
that 's funny 
well that 's good 
-ll i think we kept it at real good 
okay 
is that all we need to say 
yeah 
i 's been nice talking to you 
you too 
i think that was good 
okay 
that was the best one 
usually i get distracted off the topic 
you know what i mean 
yeah 
and we 'll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in lithuania 
and we were talking about something tot- income tax or something 
all right 
and i just 
-ell good talking to you 
anyway the i appreciate it 
have a good day 
bye bye 
okay 
so uh then do you keep kids 
is this two year old yours 
or do you keep children for other people 
no 
i have two children 
i have a two year old and a three and a half year old 
oh that 's exactly what i have 
really 
yes 
that 's wild 
i know 
i 
my my little girl was three and a half in march 
and my son was two in january 
oh boy 
well mine was two in march 
and the three and a half year old will be four in in july 
that 's pretty close 
so that is pretty close 
yeah 
but i 'm home with the kids all day 
and i have really um tried to make that a priority even though it 's financially a big strain on us 
yes 
it is 
but 
have you been able to do that all along 
or 
pretty much 
pretty much 
uh i work part-time 
but uh my husband 's able you know mostly to take care of them when i 'm working 
so uh but we adopted these two little guys and that was another reason why i really wanted to be here because you know they have had a couple foster homes already 
yeah 
oh how neat 
how old were they when you adopted 
the baby was eleven weeks old 
and his brother was twenty twenty two months 
so he probably does n't remember 
oh 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
definitely needed 
well that 's that 's pretty interesting 
well i have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids you know 
um-hum 
that was always my dream you know 
i was n't necessarily a career person but as long as i was single and had to work i was going to get a good job and do the best i could 
yeah 
yeah 
and my husband was in the type of business that you know 
it 's insurance 
so you have to build a clientele 
and by the time we had kids i could n't quit 
oh boy 
and so i have n't been able to quit yet 
so i 've had to deal a lot with child care 
and course we 're hoping within hopefully the next two years i 'll be able to quit and stay home 
yeah 
but um i started out um 
my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born until she went to work last year in august 
oh that 's mean 
and it worked out pretty good 
you know we had always said from the beginning that if it gets in the way of the friendship then i 'll take them somewhere else 
you know the friendship is more important 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them you know 
she loved them like they were hers 
and i- i knew you know 
yeah 
i had good peace of mind 
i knew that they were taken care of 
and 
that 's the hardest thing i think you know to to deal with is that people love your kids 
yeah 
i put um my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and you know that kind of thing 
uh-huh 
yes 
and uh he was in there for three months when i pulled him out 
and the the teacher had eleven kids 
it was excellent supposedly 
the reputation was fantastic for this place 
was supposed to be an excellent school 
and i had several friends who had had recommended it too 
but it really gets down to the particular teacher 
huh 
and she was a new teacher at the school 
and she had eleven you know three year olds in a room 
and i just think it was way too much 
they were almost all boys 
and she had no help 
pardon 
she had no help 
she was alone with them 
i did n't think much 
i do n't think much 
oh that is hard 
yeah 
and she was just 
my uh three year old is real active 
yeah 
and she just kept saying how wild he was 
well you know there was kind of a connotation there of him being you know it being a problem 
like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said 
well you know at three years old i do n't find that to be a behavioral problem you know 
gee 
i do n't either 
so 
i mean it 's kind of like she was there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more and it 's really hard to con- 
yeah 
you can n't control eleven three year olds with one person you know 
you have to let them have some wild time if that 's considered wild 
yeah you know 
so i just finally took him out 
plus financial reasons 
yeah 
it was expensive 
but i was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time 
but i still felt like even after all the checking i did you know you really can n't know everything about what 's going to happen 
i felt safe that the kids were n't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them you know because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms 
right 
and i felt like that was a big factor for me that they would would be safe you know from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing 
right 
yes 
yeah 
well when when my friend decided to go back to work and whenever we had problems it worked out okay because she would come and tell me 
and we 'd work it out 
yeah 
after that i found another girl that had gone to church with us that you know they needed it financially 
she had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy 
and i thought 
well you know we 'll try her 
but she came to our house 
and that just did not work 
uh-huh 
uh i mean she loved the kids 
and she was good with them 
but uh you know they were filthy when i 'd get home 
now i understand kids go out and play 
and they get dirty but i mean filthy 
yeah 
i 'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair and the and i was like gosh 
oh gosh 
and then you know my own furniture and stuff was like you know 
the kitchen table the i 'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs and the 
so you had to come home and clean before you could even do anything probably 
and clean 
and i was like 
yeah 
and then in the end um she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me 
so i was i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth 
she told me about five thirty one afternoon it was a friday that she was n't keeping kids anymore as of monday morning 
oh gosh 
well you know i work eight to five thirty 
so what am i supposed to do 
yeah 
so i well i had been sick 
and i 
it ended up that i did n't go to work monday because i was sick 
so i stayed home with them 
and we went to some of the kindercares 
oh yeah 
i was i took the kids there once just to try it 
they had a free day at kindercare 
yeah 
yeah 
well that 's what they said 
there were two pretty near our house 
and they said well bring them in this week for a free day 
so i lined up someone tuesday 
they had a mother 's day out that my babysitter took them to you know which was fine 
they liked it 
they 'd been going to it for years 
uh-hum 
and so i stayed with them monday 
tuesday they went to that 
wednesday i took them to one kindercare 
thursday i took them to another kindercare 
and then on friday my husband and i split 
but on thursday i did n't like the kindercare 's 
i did n't either 
i had one bad i had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him 
they 
they did n't give him 
and the other one was that the the younger one got bit really badly by another child 
oh 
and what they did was they took my younger one out and put him in a crib and left him in a crib the rest of the day instead of taking the kid that was biting out and do something with him 
oh that 's horrible 
and doing something with him 
yeah 
well not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month which i did n't have you know 
yeah 
i did n't i you know 
we 're we 're a christian family 
and you know they because they 're you know like public they 're not private you know they can n't pray 
yeah 
they can n't talk about god 
they can n't do anything like that 
and i do n't want them indoctrinated you know 
so you feel like your values are n't getting 
yeah 
yeah 
but i 'd like them to be able to say gee god made the flowers you know and things like that 
yeah 
yeah 
god loves you 
yeah 
you know basic things like that 
yeah 
basic 
yeah 
so um i talked to another l- lady at church 
it was like thursday of that week 
and she said oh i found the most wonderful place that i 've been taking my daughter 
and i 've know this girl 
i went to college with her 
so i really i you i- i value her opinion 
and she told me about a private one 
it it was associated with one of the churches here 
it 's not the church i go to 
but it 's you know it it was lubbock view christian church 
and it 's a private academy 
um-hum 
and so i went over there 
and i talked to the lady 
well they have like a three year waiting list 
but she said i had a mother tell me that she may take a job in san antonio 
and she has a three year old and a toddler which mine was at the time 
yeah 
and she said i should know something by tomorrow which is friday 
and she said if she leaves she said i 'll let you have her spot 
wow 
and so friday afternoon at five thirty she called me 
and she said she 's going 
you can bring your kids monday 
oh what luck 
i know 
i was just like god set this up for me 
really 
he knew i needed this 
and uh so since october then they 've been going there 
and i- 
i love it 
i have been at such peace with myself 
oh that 's great 
it 's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we do n't have the little day to day hassles 
and the cost was not near as much as the kindercares were going to be 
yeah 
oh really 
wow 
did you hear my printer in the background 
i 'm sorry 
i hope you can understand what i 'm s- 
that 's okay 
i got the dryer going in the background 
so yeah 
so 
yeah i was only about twenty dollars more a month than i was paying because being a private institution they 're nonprofit 
yeah 
so they do n't have to charge as much 
oh that 's great 
and the hours are wonderful 
and i just i think it 's the best thing 
i told russ yest- that we should have done this a long time ago you know 
yeah 
it 's great 
so i guess as long as i have to work i feel good that they 're there 
they 're getting the love the care 
they have a little curriculum 
they teach them you know the alphabet the numbers the things which you know if they learn they learn 
if they do n't they do n't 
i do n't feel like i have to indoctrinate them by age three but it 's kind of neat when they come home with it you know 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh 
at least they think it 's fun 
it 's not a big you know trauma to them to learn something 
yeah 
yeah 
oh and the teachers 
love taylor got bit several times 
and taylor bit several times 
and the teachers dealt with that 
we 're like hey they 're two 
and we keep them apart 
and we scold them 
and we correct them 
and you know they mark it all down 
and they let you know 
and and you know they get over it real quick 
and he does n't do it anymore 
and they work at the potty train- 
yeah 
i just just so mu- 
i do n't know 
i just feel like a big burden was lifted 
really 
because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because i can n't do anything with them here 
so it is 
i can n't even go grocery shopping right now with the two of them because the baby is so into everything 
i know i know and that 's hard 
and the older brother is you know running around all over the place 
so it is a 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
well and it it you know 
but i understa- 
i i i wish you could find a good mother 's day out because that would be good for your peace of mind also 
yeah 
i need to 
even just for a couple days a mornings a week or something to have something like that 
yeah 
so i- i think i 'm going to look for that 
remind me of that now that you mention it 
i was been meaning to do that you know because some of the churches do have them um you know for like six dollars per child and that 's not that big a deal you know 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
for a couple times 
and that 's usually like you know 
i do n't know when mine were going to mother 's day out 
it was like from nine to three 
so that was a pretty good pretty good time you know 
yeah 
my babysitter would take them and then pick them up 
yeah 
so that worked out real good 
yep sounds good 
well i 'm tickled to death 
i hope you find something 
and it was good talking to you 
yeah well thanks 
did we cover everything we need 
well i guess 
okay 
it said child care criteria and i think we both listed it and experiences 
okay 
yeah 
okay 
well great 
well thanks a lot 
you have a good day 
and you too 
bye-bye 
bye 
there we go 
yeah 
well um i think the weather lately has been um a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year 
i think that 's true 
the uh the bermuda grass is greening up uh in in march 
it sometimes does n't really start doing that until the first part of april 
so so i think we 're a little -head uh ahead of schedule on that 
yeah 
yeah 
i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon 
and i noticed all that grass coming up 
and i thought ooh 
we 've got to start this mowing bit soon 
that 's true 
it 's been a a fun break 
but it the break is over 
yeah 
well um oh i guess another thing i 've noticed too here lately is that even though we 've had some pretty warm days it 's been awfully gray you know just 
yeah 
now the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny 
yeah 
but it seems like every time at work i look out my window it 's gray 
well yeah 
but i 'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend 
oh i go for that 
yeah 
so yeah 
in fact i 'm a little worried about this one coming up here 
we have a long weekend 
and it sounds like it 's going to be a little bit on the cool side 
yeah 
i had n't heard whether it 's going to rain or not 
i think there 's an eighty percent chance this evening 
but it 's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow 
and then the rest 'll be without rain 
well that 's good 
but i think the highs are going to be in the sixties and the lows in the forties 
that 's getting back to a little bit chillier 
yeah 
that 's probably a a little bit under what it is for this time of year 
i- i think 
i have n't seen the weath- the n- the weather on the news in the evening lately 
but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy 
yeah 
i 'm not certain either 
but you 're probably right 
yeah 
well i like it when it 's sort of a a medium temperature uh maybe seventy five to eighty somewhere in there 
i- i do n't like it when it 's too cool or too warm 
i 'm much more apt to get things done when it 's at that sort of in between temperature 
yeah 
that 's true 
um one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high 
hm 
and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable that it does n't vary very much 
yeah 
you 're probably right 
y- i mean any other time of year that 's not the case because it could be very warm or very cold 
yes 
as a matter of fact i heard the weather the other day on tv 
and i think it was one day this week a year ago they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know it was n't just a super bad storm 
uh-huh 
right 
but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the the late spring time 
right 
yeah 
one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around this time last year was a twenty six degree lightning storm 
oh wow 
i you know i was going into the grocery store 
and a a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead 
and it was twenty six degrees out 
hm 
and i thought well gee i 've i 've never known it to lightning at that temperature 
yeah 
that that is pretty unusual 
and you really take notice of it too 
that 's right 
it uh it probably was a lot warmer up high 
sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing 
the air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees 
uh 
because the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and could n't get away 
hm wow 
yeah i do n't do n't like that super cold stuff 
nope 
i just do n't move very well when it 's that cold 
yep 
i i 'm really enjoying this now 
well this has been interesting 
yeah well 
n- not too challenging to the brain 
not not a real in depth topic but enjoyed talking to you 
nope 
all right ellen 
well you have a good day 
o- okay 
bye-bye 
good-bye 
are you a player 
uh i 'd like to think i am 
it 's it 's been a while now 
is it 
yeah 
i 've uh oh 
just recently i got married 
and we bought a house 
we 're about fifty yards from the golf course but unfortunately the house is taking up my time 
um 
yeah 
so it 's been uh it 's been almost a year i guess since i 've actually uh swung a club for a purpose 
yeah 
i ha- i have n't played in about two years 
and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here 
i work at ti 
yeah 
and i played in a tournament out there 
and i shot a net fifty nine 
they were kind of little upset 
but i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits 
yeah 
yeah 
i have a hard time inventing shots you know 
let 's go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here 
right 
and i can n't do that 
so 
right 
i i finally got out 
and i 've been watching quite a few videos 
i had n't been able to play 
so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while 
and i i hope i 'm on the right track 
yeah 
you know i shot a career low eighty nine so and my handicap 's twenty i- 
that 's that 's great 
i like the 
yeah 
no it 's uh i could say it 's been a while for me too 
i uh i 've got my wife motivated about it um and uh i think that 's probably going to be one of our next investments is get her get her a set of clubs 
really 
and uh we 'll get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up 
and hopefully we can uh we can start in 
yeah 
i 've tried to get my wife 
i bought her a set of clubs four years ago 
she has n't even swung them 
but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day 
really 
she 's she 's ready to get off into it 
well great great 
that 's good 
but you know i like i just like getting out being in the outdoors 
and i 'm a hunter and a fisher anyway 
but you know 
yeah 
same thing here 
i- you know at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf 
and it 's not going to cost me an arm and a leg really 
right 
right 
and i you know i walk 
i do n't ride 
so you know i get a little exercise there too 
um-hum 
yeah 
so 
that 's 
i 've got the same attitude 
i uh i tell you 
i- i started 
i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college 
yeah 
and uh i took uh took it as a pe course and then kind of left it alone for a while 
and then finally got got into it when i was while i was still in school and since then uh we 've made it um 
right 
as as the friends start getting married and things like that we 've made a tradition of uh having a a thursday or 
well have have probably like a like a thursday night bachelor party and a friday golf day before the wedding 
yeah 
and uh so it 
that 's back in south dakota where i grew up and uh so that that 's uh that 's been my main my main involvement 
oh 
is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here 
but uh eventually i get people to come and visit me in dallas 
yeah 
and then i 'll show them that we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can n't do it back home 
yeah 
it 's pretty nice 
we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not 
they were amazed 
yeah 
you know here it is sixty five degrees 
we 're out playing golf 
and they 're freezing cold back there 
so but i uh picked it up when i was in high school at on the same as a pe course and then 
yep 
yep 
when i got into the service i got into it and then when i come out here i just kind of let it go 
oh -kay 
and then one of one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf 
i said well yeah you know 
i 've got my clubs 
but i have n't swung them in quite a few years 
yeah 
and then i got into it and then back out of it 
and it it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there 
yeah 
that 's right 
you know i really enjoy it 
it 's really nice 
oh it i- it 's it 's a lot of fun e- especially if you can find somebody that 's uh that 's got the same level of interest 
that that seems to be the hardest thing 
yeah 
well about 
that- that 's that 's true of any sport you know 
if you want to play tennis or racquetball 
yeah you do n't want to go out and get beat to death 
but 
right 
and and people do n't want to play with somebody that they 're going to beat every time you know and and uh 
no 
and then you know we 've got some guys here they 're you know four and five handicappers and they do n't like to play with me because i 'm too slow for them 
and 
so you know but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time 
um-hum right 
that 's right 
yeah 
and i 've you know i 've 
never never yet have i walked up 
now i 've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with 
and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that would n't allow me to join their twosome or threesome 
that 's true 
you know they 're always friendly 
that 's true 
sure come on out you know 
and they do n't mind if you make a mistake 
they do n't mind saying well you know let me tea- tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or 
well 
you know it 's it 's pretty nice and friendly out there and you can n't find that in all sports 
that that that 's uh 
yeah 
that 's absolutely right 
and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you y- you know 
you you get s- you get in a rut i- if you do play a lot 
but you play with the same people you you are n't going to learn anything 
right yeah 
uh after after a short period once you learn everything they 've got to offer 
then uh you know you 've basically tapped your resources there 
yeah 
you need to 
yeah 
but uh i 'd i 'd like to uh eventually i 'd like to w- work up if if my wife does get interested and and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that 
oh yeah 
we we have one down here in the summertime 
uh it runs from like five oclock to seven thirty or eight oclock you know because it does n't get dark -til nine thirty or ten 
um-hum 
right 
and we play in the summertime out here 
we get a mixed league in 
and that 's what i 'm trying to get her ready for 
it 's going to start well when we we change the time back whenever that is next month i guess 
uh-huh 
and it 'll start then 
and you know we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago 
and they were just starting to learn 
and you know they were shooting a hundred a hundred and twenty but they were you know 
sure 
now they 're down into the hundreds nineties 
right 
so it wo n't take her long you know 
well that 's good that 's good that sounds like a lot of fun 
and it 's something we can do together 
so well she does n't do much hunting 
she could care less about that 
yeah 
she does a little fishing 
but you know golf would give her the exercise 
she 'd be outside 
give her something to do that we both enjoy 
so 
yeah 
it it sounds like we 've got real similar situations 
yeah 
uh i i go home uh i 've gone home every year now since i 've moved to dallas to to go pheasant hunting 
and uh um the the last time i i took my wife along 
um-hum 
and uh k- kind of the same situation 
she s- she sat in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff 
but she 'll definitely uh she 'll make the trip for fishing if we if that comes along 
yeah 
yeah 
but uh it 's uh that 's interesting 
all right 
yeah 
and it 's you know it 's a game that you do n't 
like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl a hundred 
but if you shoot a hundred in golf you know 
you do n't have to be an expert to play 
though um-hum that 's right 
any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right 
um-hum 
so you know you do n't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all 
that 's right 
well yeah 
that 's i 've i 've kind of formed the attitude that you know i- if i could just if i could pick two or three shots out uh out of my game every time and put them together on one hole then i do pretty good and then and i keep i keep rationalizing well you know i i can do it 
yeah 
i i just got to do it all at the on the same hole 
and and then it 'll get better 
and you just keep going 
and in the meantime just enjoy what you 're doing 
yeah 
and it it it really works that way 
and when you know when i first got back into it i used to get mad because i knew i could do something 
and i did n't get it done 
um-hum 
you know 
and i just well i need to slice this ball around here 
i naturally slice anyway 
now you know the ball 'll go straight 
and i go 
yeah 
i never broke a club or anything 
but you know i 'd get upset about it sometimes 
yeah 
and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit 
sure 
i do n't get upset any more 
so and 
sure 
yeah that 's great 
well i enjoyed talking to you 
well you bet 
i guess i 'll go back to work 
okay 
sounds like it 
all right 
see you later 
okay 
bud bye-bye 
bye 
all right 
well like i told you before 
and you 're talking about credit cards 
um-hum 
we put ours up 
i mean i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up 
um i wish i had 
well you should try it 
well i 
it was done for me after a while 
i had a uh i had a business going 
and this was back in the eighties 
i do n't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that 
but uh i had a coin shop 
and everything was going great while gold and silver was up 
and it started falling 
yeah 
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards 
and things got worse and worse 
and finally boom 
you lost your business 
yep 
oh go- 
what a nightmare 
yeah 
yeah it was 
i ended up going into bank- you know 
it was one of those things uh 
oh it 'll get better next week you know 
things will pick up 
and so there i was in old bankruptcy court 
well you were n't charging gold and silver were you 
you can n't do that can you 
oh yeah 
oh you can 
yeah oh yeah 
yeah 
i was buying from other dealers 
and uh you know they take payment any way they can get it 
oh that 's a nightmare 
yeah 
course on on stuff that i was on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back 
because i was selling it 
i was n't buying you know just to hold onto it 
um but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up 
um 
so 
well i remember before i got married 
you know when you graduate from college they 'll send you all those credit card applications you know 
um-hum 
um-hum 
of course you fill them all out because you 're honored 
sure 
right and uh i had stuff for like sanger harris 
and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars 
and i thought well that 's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month 
um-hum 
right 
yes 
i was n't thinking a thing about it 
that 's the way they suck you in 
yeah 
i was just stupid 
and every time they had a sale there i was 
um-hum 
because you know got get such good bargains 
um-hum 
and i do n't know 
well just today in the mail i got uh i got got my guaranteed acceptance by uh american express 
oh yeah 
we 've been getting those 
yeah 
i went back to school and got my master 's 
and they started sending those things to me again 
yeah 
as soon as your a graduate student they get your name 
yeah 
they did 
and uh course i guess i guess i 've been purged from their records 
i used to have an american express 
uh back when i had my business i got one 
uh-huh 
and they they goofed up bad on my fir- on my very first bill 
because i was using the american express strictly for the travel expenses 
yeah 
and the bill would come in 
and i 'd pay it 
and the very first bill i paid it 
and then i got this nasty letter from them saying you 're overdue pay 
so i- i said well it just crossed in the mail 
so i did n't do anything about it 
two weeks later i get another letter even nastier 
and said we 're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you do n't pay 
and i looked at that 
and i said uh-huh 
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank 
so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks 
hum 
and now they were n't check 
yeah 
they were i tell you 
they do n't talk about they were charging that enormous fee every year 
in now what is it now 
it 's up to fifty five on the gold card 
it 's eighty five for the optima 
oh i 'm sorry no fifty 
fifty 
what do you mean fifty five 
you mean fifty five dollars 
yeah 
for the green card 
but then what 's the interest 
and it well now and that 's that 's the card fee 
and interest is like eighteen or something 
oh yeah 
yeah 
it 's um 
well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there is n't any 
but on the optima card it 's 
um let 's see right now it 's running at about 
it 's not too bad 
it 's actually it 's about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good as far as credit cards go 
yeah 
well credit cards 
well they 're dangerous 
you know my parents do n't hardly use them 
hum-um 
mine do n't either 
mine do n't either 
they have 
um my mom has a uh has a mastercard and a visa card 
and that 's it 
i 've got all my gas cards because i do n't want to carry money around 
yeah 
i 'll do that 
yeah 
now i- i do use gas cards 
now impact is kind of bad too though 
yeah 
you know especially if you get forget to record those little suckers 
ye- yeah oh yeah 
exactly 
uh plastic is just too easy 
i mean that 's the that 's the whole problem with it 
uh-huh 
um 
well and you 're tempted if you 've got cash a little bit of cash and you do n't have enough for the purchase right 
ha- yeah 
of course you got to charge it and keep your cash 
sure 
naturally 
that 's 
i got in all kinds of trouble doing that 
what what are you saying 
oh uh my husband says i might buy it 
but i- i do n't really usually consider that an option 
well ha- having having been out of the credit game for some years now i 've i 've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it 
maybe that 's how we got in trouble 
and uh 
yeah 
but it 's hard is n't it 
well it is 
but i- i- i 'm kind of uh grateful for the experience because it 's taught me a lot of restraint 
well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic 
uh yeah 
exactly 
i- i um i just went out and got a new vcr yesterday with cash 
with cash 
and it it 's 
do you work with ti 
no 
no 
no i wish i did 
yeah 
you could have got a discount could n't you 
yeah 
i could use a discount 
i have to wait for the things to go on sale 
but there 's always a sell 
yeah 
especially on electronic goods especially now 
yeah 
what is that thing i saw 
circuit circuit world or something 
oh circuit city 
circuit city 
have you been in that 
yeah 
they they 're not their prices are n't that terrific 
they they used to be 
but they 've gotten they 've got to pay for all that national advertising now 
oh it 's national 
um-hum 
i think i 've seen two around dallas 
yeah 
they 're they 're all over the country now 
well what else 
they uh th- they used to be good 
i remember when they first opened up 
they did have good bargains 
i do n't know if you have a place there called uh 
or you probably have something similar 
we call it service merchandise 
yeah 
in garland 
yo- you got service merchandise 
uh-huh 
yeah 
it used to be service merchandise was the place to go 
and uh circuit city came along 
and that was the place to go to get your tvs and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that 
and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price 
and actually service merchandise is cheaper than them now 
so 
sure 
so much for circuit city 
okay 
what else can we talk about 
who do you work for 
i do n't 
i 'm a graduate student 
i 'm a professional student 
sounds wonderful 
it is 
we were talking about that just today 
it 's it 's great 
we could be just lifelong students 
it is great 
i love it 
where are you going to school 
nc state 
what 's that 
uh north carolina state 
so you 're on spring break 
not yet 
ours do n't ours does n't start until uh next week 
so where are you 
where am i 
yeah 
what do you mean where 
oh 
in raleigh 
oh okay 
yeah 
good ole the burgeoning metropolis of raleigh 
wh- what a dead place 
yeah is it 
yeah 
i 've got a nice little business at home 
and i sit around and tinker with that most of the time 
so what are you getting your degree in 
um uh human factors 
and what do you do with it 
not a thing 
well what is it 
uh its it 's it 's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them 
so it 's sociology 
huh it 's well it 's more psychology and engineering 
uh 
my my master 's is in industrial engineering 
so you 're working on your doctorate 
yeah 
oh lord 
yeah phd in human factors 
oh that 'll that 'll sound wonderful wo n't it 
well 
get you a little name plaque 
oh yeah 
ibm uh 
i mean uh a lot of people use human factors 
folks 
but ibm is what i 'm looking at right now 
are n't are n't they laying off several thousand people 
they might be 
but not at not at the human factors level 
there there 
well i heard it on the news today 
i could swear it was ibm 
um no 
as a matter of fact the ibm right here or in carey which is a little suburb of raleigh just just hired one more human factors person 
hum 
doggone it 
if they 'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been 
me 
how much longer do you have 
um i 'm i 'm going into thes- or going into the uh dissertation this summer 
and get that done this summer 
uh i 'm going to start this summer 
i probably wo n't finish it until the end of the year but uh i 'm i 'm trying to get a uh a uh intern position with ibm right now so that i can find an area to do my dissertation in 
ooh 
because you 
it 's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field 
why 
there been so much work done already 
but yeah 
that 's 
that and and it 's it 's limited application in some respects 
um consi- in the area that we 're in here there 's a lot of places that use human factors people 
most 
okay 
so what kind of car are you thinking about getting 
well none at the moment 
well when you decide to 
no 
no 
no 
i currently drive a a ford taurus 
uh-huh 
and i would ima- i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car a new car i will go with the taurus or something similar uh in that regard 
so you like the ford 
absolutely 
i have had it for about two years now and it 's uh it 's everything it 's supposed to be 
uh-huh 
uh i have n't had a minutes trouble with it and uh the only thing i have against it in that 's it 's a taurus 
uh-huh 
but is it i still feel a little even after two years i still feel uncomfortable driving it because i had a honda before that and so it 's a little bit larger 
uh-huh 
right 
but that 's the only the only difference that i see really 
but i would 
my my criteria would be at the moment it would be uh american uh personally 
and 
uh-huh 
yeah 
it 's the 
this 
the car i had before this one was a thunderbird as a matter of fact 
um-hum 
and uh i loved it 
i really did 
but uh um i finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were 
so i bought myself a a a nissan a two forty s x 
uh-huh 
but even though i love the car i 've got now i think my next car will probably be american again because if i can at all do it i 'd like to stay american 
uh-huh 
i always have up until now 
i just for one time decided to go outside 
so 
well my wife drives a still has a a honda accord 
uh-huh 
and it 's a very it 's an excellent automobile and uh but you know price and so forth 
uh-huh 
i 'm not a real car fan 
so i i i do not uh opt for uh something that would be you know expensive you know 
right 
i want i want something that 's serviceable serviceable something that i can use and uh and i 
uh-huh 
and with the taurus 
i have a taurus uh you know lx 
and it 's you know 
you 're talking when you think about price it 's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable honda or nissan or something along those lines 
uh-huh 
and as i said as far i 'm concerned it it has been extremely uh uh serviceable and everything i wanted 
well ford 's done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to te- six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um 
uh-huh 
oh i think so too 
now i you know 
in travel and renting automobiles uh in 
uh-huh 
i 've driven you know chevrolet automobiles and so for- and dodge 
and i 
if it 's chevrolet i just will not touch it 
um 
uh i had a chevrolet before i bought my taurus 
i purchased a a chevy um citation 
uh-huh oh yeah 
those were not good cars 
and uh i was ready to get rid of it two months after i bought it 
uh-huh 
and uh so i i shopped around 
and i would i probably if i had thought i uh wanted to pay the amount of money i probably would have gone with uh uh an accord or even a a civic or something comparable from nissan or or toyota 
uh-huh 
right 
and uh but it was just 
i had i have a friend who uh has a uh an auto shop 
and he purchased one of the first sables that was uh manufactured for his wife a sable station wagon 
and he just absolutely swore by it 
uh-huh 
and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and am fm radio and all these other things uh it was just 
uh-huh 
there was no there was no comparison uh 
the only thing that i find you know if i would have anything against it is that it still has that soft american ride 
right 
uh uh not well 
that about the only thing i find you know disadvantageous to it 
but my criteria is simply something that looks good something that 's serviceable 
and i you know i drive around a lot 
but uh and it 's you know it 's very comfortable on the highway 
i can drive for you know ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way 
uh-huh 
but those are my criteria 
and i i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again 
and if there 's something out there that uh is comparable to what i have now so i 'll go ahead and get it 
uh-huh 
you know the only thing i 'm looking at right now um 
i just i just bought you know the nissan that i 've got about uh say nine months ago 
i guess it was 
so the only thing that that would um get me to change cars right now would be if 
see at the moment i 'm single 
and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it 
but uh i do n't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know 
um-hum uh-huh 
uh cars are too expensive right now to uh to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know 
i 
see yeah 
it 's 
in our parking lots uh two or three days ago i saw one of the new honda sports cars 
uh-huh 
uh i i can n't remember what the name is 
it 's the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is 
and it looked it resembled a mazaratti very very closely 
uh-huh um 
and it 's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth 
uh-huh 
but to pay that much money for an automobile uh is just 
i can n't i can n't conceive of doing that 
yeah 
that 's uh 
i went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago 
and um you know of course they had the normal the ford the the chevrolet that stuff 
but then you started looking at the uh uh 
they had ferrari there they had uh bmw and and all these other kind of cars 
and and ferrari did n't even let you near the car 
i mean they were 
that 's how expensive they were 
um-hum 
um and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars 
you saw eighty thousand dollar cars 
and you know even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but uh i can n't see buying or paying more for a car than i would for a house you know 
that 's true well 
i that does n't seem likely 
uh the difference there is too is uh is between us is that i am not really crazy about driving 
uh-huh 
i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver 's license when i was young when i was sixteen 
uh-huh 
so i 've never really cared 
now what i was you know 
before i was married and before i went to graduate school i used to do little you know sports car racing 
i never it was never my own car it was always someone else 's 
uh-huh 
and that sort of thing i enjoy 
but to go out and drive uh never has really been had any appeal to me in that regard 
uh-huh 
so well i guess we 've discussed that enough 
do n't you think 
i think so 
we wo n't we do n't we wo n't get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight 
that 's happened to me almost every time i 've 
that 's happened to me once 
so uh 
well whe- it 's it 's very easy when you get a top- you get on a topic that you know you enjoy 
yeah 
like uh you know i think the one time i did it was on sau- the mid the mid east the crisis out there 
and oh yeah 
and everything that was had a great conversation 
but uh then they came off and told us we could n't do it any more 
so 
yeah well i was talking to a lady last evening 
and we were talking about fishing 
and uh we were cut off uh-huh well 
we were told to quit 
uh-huh yeah 
okay 
well you have a pleasant evening 
you too 
take care 
uh-huh bye-bye 
good-bye 
okay 
i was thinking about camping and different i- people 's ideas about it 
um-hum 
we 've even seen people with these campers 
and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their tv when they 're going 
right or the satellite dish 
but that 's not 
yeah 
a satellite dish 
on top of those recreational vehicles 
oh golly 
that 's not the kind we do 
do you go camping 
yeah 
we have a little bit 
and we 've just gotten one of those little tents that we throw out on the ground 
and that 's what we camp in 
so we kind of rough it 
well so do we 
in fact when we first got married we would try to take these trips to minnesota to see his family and we did n't have a tent or any camping supplies 
um-hum 
so we 'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks 
oh no 
i mean i know it 's dangerous 
i would n't do it now 
but we did 
and one time we went to yellowstone 
and we were doing the same thing 
we could n't find a place to camp 
and so we were on top of a picnic table with our our sleeping bags i guess 
and this ranger comes up with this light shines it on us and said that we 're just bear bait out there we had our food you know and told us to get inside our car 
oh 
uh-huh 
gosh bear bait 
bear bait 
that would make me nervous 
yeah 
have you done any camping around here 
yeah 
we 've got some land at holly lake outside of tyler 
uh-huh 
and go up there fairly often 
sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it 
yeah 
that sounds fun 
and we 've done things like when when it 's kind of cold 
we take extension cords 
and we 've all got heaters in our tents 
and in the summer 
same thing we get our extension cords running from all these tents 
but we 've got the fans going 
right 
so we 're not roughing it too much 
yeah 
and we have taken tvs out there for the kids 
yeah 
and they 've got their electrical hookups 
so it 's not so bad 
yeah 
do you go on long 
like a week at a time or just weekends 
i think the longest we 've stayed out there is like five days 
uh-huh 
and they even they had a library at one time out there 
oh 
so that 's really not roughing it so much 
but we have gone on trips we 've bathed in streams 
yeah 
uh-huh 
that 's kind of different 
yeah 
i like the campgrounds that have a nice shower 
and a pool to go to 
uh-huh 
that would be nice 
yeah 
we 've uh we camped at the degray state park in arkansas in the fall 
and there was nobody else hardly around 
and it was just really nice that time of year 
we had taken our electric blanket too just in case it was unbearable 
but we did n't need it 
well my husband has even camped at lake lavon with one of his friends 
oh really 
he just decided to take the kids out there 
yeah 
i mean it 's not very many miles from our house at all 
but they had the time of their lives you know 
oh yeah 
had the boat just pulled up right by the tents 
uh-huh 
it was n't bad 
that sounds nice 
yeah 
and we 've taken our tents though loaded them up in the car carrier and decided we were going to tent most of the way 
and it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night we 'd take a vote 
and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel 
yeah 
instead of getting out all that stuff you know 
yeah 
it 's a lot of work to set up just for one night 
yeah 
then you have to get up the next day and move it on 
right 
huh-uh 
but we 're set now 
we 've got cook stoves 
and we 've got our bug light 
and everybody 's got their sleeping bags 
we got air mattresses 
we decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable 
yeah 
those are nice 
we have one of those too 
yeah 
those double ones 
uh-huh 
pretty good 
we 're on our third one i think 
somehow 
yeah 
how do you blow yours up 
we 've got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter 
oh 
w- we were looking at those in a magazine 
last time we went we took our vacuum cleaner with us 
i did n't know you could do that 
and yeah you can if you can reverse the nozzle on your vacuum cleaner and it blows air out instead of sucking it in 
yeah 
and you can fill them up that way 
but it something that 's smaller would be a lot more convenient 
no joke 
i hope you did n't have a big vacuum cleaner 
no 
uh-huh 
we have a my husband and i we have a pickup truck 
so there 's plenty of room to hold things 
yeah 
now we 've used a hair dryer before 
uh-huh 
but i put it on hot and also melted it 
oh no 
i found that you do n't do that 
yeah 
i did n't realize it would melt so easily 
oh 
i do n't know 
we take we take our dog camping 
she likes to go out and stay in the woods 
yeah 
sleep she sleeps in the tent with us 
it 's fun 
i do n't like it when there 's mosquitoes so bad 
oh me either 
and then one night we were camping 
and it came just a torrential downpour 
we had the steaks on the grill 
these people were with us 
and it i mean everything was sopping wet inside the tent 
it was just that bad you know 
oh no 
and we decided we 'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything 
uh-huh 
so i got a condo with a jacuzzi 
and it was wonderful 
oh boy 
yeah 
that was lucky 
yeah 
it was 
we 've been lucky 
we 've never really been rained on the few times we 've gone 
it 's horrible 
oh i bet it 
when we were younger when i was a kid we camped in virginia 
and we had one of those little pop up tents which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground 
but it seemed like it rained every weekend for about a ye- the year we we were really into camping 
you mean that you put on a truck or what 
uh no 
it 's a little trailer you pull behind your car 
and uh you know you the lid pops off 
oh yeah 
yeah 
the little tent comes up the top and it had two double beds in it 
how many weeks have you been doing these calls 
oh since the beginning 
i guess it 's been two or three weeks 
i think this must be into my third week too 
so do you work for ti 
uh well i work as a temporary in the speech lab 
in a speech lab 
uh-huh 
where they 're doing this program the voice recognition program 
and what exactly are they going to do 
oh they turn them over to somebody 
and they 're going to i guess they 're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff 
so any voice no matter what the speech pattern or the dialect or anything 
right 
yeah 
hum i wonder if these are going to be speaking the computers 
i do n't know 
i type up the tapes of what people talked about 
oh that 's kind of neat 
yeah 
it 's sort of interesting 
do you put all the uh-hums in here on everything too 
uh-huh 
everything like that 
all the little stutters and everything 
what do you write for stutter 
duh duh 
oh like if they say i i we just type it in like that 
uh-huh 
well i guess that 's it for camping huh 
i guess so unless you want to talk about stakes 
which kind of stakes to put in 
you need metal instead of plastic 
yeah 
and you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time 
yeah 
we got one of those kind that have got the 
oh what is it 
they 're plastic 
and they 've got the elastic on the inside of the poles 
and you just put them together 
oh uh-huh 
that 's what we have too 
and it 's a dome tent 
yeah 
that 's what ours is 
that 's good is n't it 
yeah 
yeah 
they pop up pretty fast 
yeah 
have you ever camped on sand 
but um no 
that can be a mess 
we camped at the beach one time 
and that was sort of miserable 
you just coul- 
everywhere you went there was sand 
you could n't 
even when you 're eating 
it it was in your bed 
i 've done it in a shelter 
uh-huh 
it was in padre island and in a truck of course it 's not but not in a tent 
oh 
uh-huh 
oh well that 's about all 
okay 
i know to okay 
well it 's good talking to you 
uh-huh 
bye 
bye 
hello 
hello 
this is jim in dallas 
uh how you doing 
fine 
i 'm callie in garland 
oh you 're right here

yes 
i 'm i 'm actually working tonight 
i just uh called and came in 
oh are you 
so do you work at ti 
yeah 
you 
yeah 
i just got a little booklet uh this not what we 're supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts 
and i thought oh i better make some calls 
i know 
i know 
are n't they 
yeah 
well i have n't get a chance i have n't got a chance to look at them yet 
i love it in the it was a lot nicer than i expected 
my daughter uh got a few calls at home 
she talked to some student in 
i guess they give them to computer students too and uh virginia or something like that 
she 's talked to two students 
i 've talked to 
i do n't think they were students 
one i think worked at a university university um and the furthest away i 've talked to someone has been new york 
yeah 
oh yeah 
great 
uh we 're supposed to talk about the elderly now i guess uh 
so yes 
we are 
do you have anybody that you uh h- are close to that decision on or anything 
or i 've thought about it for myself and all 
and my wi- my wife 's mother is uh in a retirement home 
she 's not in a nursing home uh 
oh well that 's not 
did you push the button 
yeah 
did i did we push 
did you 
let me i 'll hit again just in case 
okay 
just in case 
i did it right as she said 
yeah 
but uh she 's she 's down in san antonio it 's it 's a uh it 's a brand new one 
now what 's 
oh 
it 's a catholic uh retirement home for nuns 
it 's at uh trinity 
oh 
no 
let me see trinity 
i keep calling it trin- 
it 's not trinity 
i 'll think of 
incarnate word 
and they have a retirement home for the nuns and they take some lay people 
well is n't that neat 
is n't that neat 
yeah 
and that one 's really super 
now i- i know what they 're talking about on regular retirement 
yeah 
there 's not too many 
they do have a wing where the people who are really sick you know have nurses 
uh-huh 
oh that 's good 
and then they have other wings that we visited uh that are very nice 
i mean it 's just super 
that 's neat 
just supervised more or less than anything and security i guess 
oh yeah 
they they they have uh like uh a guard with locks 
we 've been there once at night at christmas 
she just went in last year 
for them oh 
she drives and everything 
she she 's perfectly healthy 
right 
uh 
what made you all decide to put her or h- what made her decide to go 
well her husband died 
they were in the military together 
and she just did not want to take care of the house and she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind so to speak 
right 
by herself ah well that 's good 
and so she 's happy as as heck 
uh and they they have serve meals of course 
that 's great 
and they have clubs and a swimming pool 
so that 's nice 
now i i know the ones where you 're really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one 
um-hum 
and they were all more or less hospitalized type you know really really sick 
right 
shut-ins and 
it 's a tough question 
yeah 
it really is 
i worked at one as a teenager 
i volunteered 
oh you got ex- more experience than i do then on it 
at at well it was really it was really sad heartbreaking i guess 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh i just oh i just felt for those people th- especially the ones that never got visited 
oh that would be awful 
that just bothered me 
i never thought about that you know 
that just bothered me so much especially you know at my age 
i was probably about fourteen 
um-hum 
and that really made a bad impression on me 
so i 've always thought not not really bad of them i mean because they are most of them i- i believe are probably pretty good for the people 
but i do n't know 
it 's just a that would be a tough tough decision 
yeah 
i think that uh hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it 
and they 're getting nicer 
right 
i 've seen on tv where they take animals and young children 
in fact my daughter is one 
my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school took them to an elderly home 
and and boy that really pumps them up 
helps 
yeah 
that uh is very nice to see young people 
i think that 's one of the sad things is when you 're in an older home 
um-hum 
um-hum 
if you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you know you can n't take care of them 
right 
right 
ob- obvious you can n't take care of children or animals in a nursing home 
right 
but it 's nice to have them visit and everything 
yeah 
and get that youth back 
yeah 
you know sometimes that even helps them you know just being around young people the because some of them are so um you know just stationary i mean they 'll get in a wheelchair 
right 
or they 'll just sit in a chair 
and and till you come along and really try and pump them up they 're just stationary 
and i feel like gosh that 's all they do all day long 
so um so i do love to see young kids go and and men take the pets and everything 
i think that 's a real real neat idea 
yeah 
i think you do get more by stimul- stimulation 
my in fact my mother-in-law just visited 
she 's just about seventy five again perfectly fine 
yeah 
but one and and she visit us here in in dallas 
when she went back every time she goes back to uh san antonio my wife has two sisters there too she said she 's much better 
she 's much more alive and and uh active when she 's been on a visit with somebody else you know and and our routine has come obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she 's much 
that 's 
yeah 
right 
and so the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around uh that 's the fastest way to die i think you know 
right 
stagnant 
yeah 
that 's exactly right 
i think they 're really neat 
um of course i 've seen those reports on tv the horrible ones and that scares me 
oh yeah 
i 'm afraid i 'm a tv flipper 
anything bad i like i like to flip i flip it off 
but it is sad 
it 's sad 
yeah 
it really is it it 's sad to think that we would do that to people 
and you know i 've seen them on tv with uh bed sores 
and uh they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry 
oh yeah 
and i just think how can you do that 
the- these people have have given so much of their lives you know to to america you know or whatever 
yeah 
and here is here is how we treat them 
we just put them in a home and leave them 
right 
when i was uh younger we i lived in the east 
i 'm from the east really 
and it seemed like there several people that i knew that had their uh parents i guess they would be but well in their seventy living with them 
um-hum 
and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old 
and i guess she she had her own separate room 
and i think whether it 's more a custom up there or maybe because i was younger and it 's just not a custom anymore to have uh you know the grandparents live with you anymore 
right 
i guess that uh well we are getting away from that which is not right 
i think 
it 's right 
i think it 's neat 
i think uh you learn a lot from them y- from all their experiences 
oh yeah 
and and that 's one of my favorite things to do sit around and listen to their stories 
oh right 
right 
i think that 's neat 
because they really have a lot of good i- insights that my fa- my husband 's father is really old 
yeah 
he he had him late in life 
and he 's he 'll be eighty this year 
oh 
and i just uh he lives with different you know people in the family 
he 'll switch from time to time 
i just 
well that 's nice in a lot of ways 
yeah 
i just could n't imagine locking 
not locking him up but putting him in a home and just 
but that you were you said that by mistake 
yeah 
right 
lock him up 
that 's what i think about it for me 
i think well my kids better not do that to me 
oh i know 
i know 
i do n't want that you know 
so i- i think of it well how would i want to be treated rather than you 
r- right right 
exactly 
know it 's easy to say well yeah 
let 's let 's put these old folks in a home 
but when i think i do n't want to do that you know 
i do n't want to be have my little home 
um-hum that 's right 
i always threaten my daughters 
i say well i 'm going to build a little house behind yours 
and then and i 'll take care of your lawn he says 
but i 'm not going to one of those places 
oh you 're not going to put me away 
right 
yeah 
that 's what my mother 
she always 
you 're going to lock me up one day are n't you 
i can t- i can tell 
you 're going to lock me up 
that 's what we that 's the way we call it which is really wrong 
i know 
but my wife 's mother and the one she 's in san ant- 
it 's you know it 's everything but 
the opposite of what you 've seen 
i mean it 's uh it 's a little ho- hotel you might say 
it right 
that 's great 
and again a swimming pool and grounds 
and she has enough room 
she has two bedrooms and a and a separate living area 
gosh 
they do n't have kitchens or anything but they have little it 's like uh on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal you know 
right 
yes 
prepare your 
well that 's great 
c- now can she leave um on a day by herself 
oh yeah 
it 's it 's it 's nothing like that 
it 's like living in the hotel 
i mean she 's totally on her own 
oh man 
that 's neat 
uh and she still drives which we do does scare us some because she has dented a few things you know 
and we keep thinking about that you know because she they get less alert 
yeah right 
and they do n't care 
and i 've seen some of these elderly people on tv you know the ones from florida that just run into people 
and they do n't even understand what happened you know 
right 
i know 
bless their hearts 
you hate to hurt them by doing that 
that 's like their one last thing that they can still do 
i know 
and you take away that driving ability 
and that would really be hard 
we 've uh well we 've thought about doing that for for my husband 's father because he 's 
i- i know 
go ahead 
i 'm sorry 
oh he still drives 
yeah 
that 's gr- well it 's wonderful in one one respect 
but i do n't know if you can afford the insurance 
yeah 
well luckily he drives a big old tank 
yeah 
so he i mean i do n't think he he could get hurt 
i just hope to god he does n't ever hurt anyone 
but he he has n't had any accidents luckily 
right 
that 's good 
i mean people are all different 
yeah 
yeah 
i- i wonder if they should give them a test or at least maybe uh not take their license maybe give them a refresher driving course and just to just to see how well they are every five years 
right i saw that on twenty twenty 
are they doing it 
that they um you know they 're testing that they 're you know thinking of doing that 
and i think that 'd be a great idea because you i think they do come become less aware 
and they just i do n't know they and they do n't hear as well for one thing and that does n't help 
yeah 
well everybody needs retraining 
it does n't hurt uh you know 
best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches 
and i do n't know why you could n't after sixty five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving 
no that 's right right 
it would it would sure the insurance companies would would probably help pay for some of that you know 
at least that way the burden 's not on the family of taking their license or their car away 
right 
there you go 
there 's a good point very good point 
it 's on the state 
very good point 
but i think they nee- should do that 
and then the families will have said 
so uh what do you think about our involvement in the middle east 
well actually i think it 's good 
i i i hope that we uh uh get a chance to uh promote peace out there uh because i think without peace we 're not going to get uh stable oil prices 
and and uh i 'd i 'd really like to see stability in in that area because i 'm always afraid that 's where uh another big war is going to start 
not that desert storm was a small one 
yeah 
well yeah 
that 's probably true 
i i suspect that if any world war is come at this point in time they 're going to come from there uh i would think anyway 
i mean it just seems to me that that 's that 's the most unstable part of the world as far as i can tell 
i saw um just recently where uh uh the us is supposedly going to be uh putting pressure on all the you know the israelis supposedly to to come to a bargaining table to 
uh actually i heard that the israelis were even talk- at least mentioned about giving up some of the golan heights 
really 
yeah 
that 'd be interesting because i um i actually um um i 'm i 'm i 'm jewish 
and i 'm actually sort of not n- not not not really a zionist per se you know 
okay 
i 'm not but i have a um i have a lot of friends you know who are sort of adamant you know israel 
should it 's his right 
and they do whatever they want 
and i think they 've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing 
and uh you know in some sense m- the moderates may be right 
they may you know may be it is better if they give up just a little bit just to sort of settle things down 
well uh i guess it 's one of those things that uh if it 's going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace 
right 
the- then then it then is it worth it at all 
yeah 
i mean i i because the way 
i mean sort of the way to think about it is well they won you know 
they sort of took over the um 
they 're one of the only countries in in in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war which they did n't start basically 
so 
oh 
yeah 
so i do n't i do n't know how to i do n't i do n't know what to do about it 
but um but i think that that you know in general the region is really in bad shape 
do you think the us is going to wind up keeping uh military bases over there 
um probably 
oh is n't is n't there a plan now to make a command center there or something 
i i have n't heard that 
i i watch cnn every once in a while 
but i i have n't specifically heard anything about that 
i just heard something about moving recently about moving um 
there there there 's some central command post in tampa i think they now want to move to somewhere in the middle east 
actually there was um a small country or small city i think well you know not actually in saudi arabia or or anything but a little bit off to the um east of it i think 
and i 
they want to keep something over there so that they do n't have to um 
i guess it 's i guess it 's so that so they do n't have to move troops out so quickly or something 
i 'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it 
but they want to keep some sort of central command post there 
what i thought was interesting is that uh apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet 
that 's true 
and uh well i guess there 's still the possibility that uh hostilities with uh us troops could still break out 
yeah 
yeah that th- th- they claim that 's why we 're still there 
i mean you know why only 
you note it 's only only a small number of people have actually come back yet 
yeah 
but i think that 's actually the scariest part because when in the way what what 's happening in iraq right now you know just in itself it it it being so crazy there 
i have no idea 
what i mean what do you know 
just to imagine that one day they 're going to turn around and someone 's going to say we do n't like you 
and just start attacking again 
and it 's going to be worse 
i do n't know 
um 
do you have relatives over in israel 
no 
i do n't 
i ha- i i have some friends in israel 
and and coincidently actually my wife is syrian 
um 
oh really 
yeah 
so i am 
we are sort of we are the middle east peace talks at home 
um 
and uh 
pardon me 
i 'm just sort of putting away some things from dinner now in the background 
yeah 
but we um we she has sort of friends and family in saudi arabia ac- well friends in saudi arabia 
and um i have some friends in israel 
and we we talk a bit about it 
but we try and keep it out of out of the home life 
do you uh 
d- does she ever want to go back to syria 
no 
she was she 's actually um 
i think it 's um for her not not really relevant because she was she 's second generation american actually 
oh okay 
her parents who were born here would like to go see it though i think 
they would like to go to syria 
but but they recognize that syria 's not the place that one wants to visit right about now 
no 
no 
you know just something about the place makes it not not quite enjoyable 
do you ever want to go over to israel 
yeah 
i i 'd actually been there 
oh okay 
um i was there a couple years ago when it was n't as you know sort of dangerous to be out there i guess 
yeah 
and i do i d- i do like it actually 
um i would never live there 
i think i 'm too americanized and um sort of have too much you know too much invested in sort of th- the easy life 
yeah 
but i do like the food if that if so if that if if that amounts for anything 
yeah 
okay 
well who you know 
do you have uh a lot of kosher foods there at your house 
yeah 
actually my house is kosher 
but um it turns out that o- one of the strangest things about about israel is that no um most folks do n't realize that but all the food that people think of as sort of you know jewish food and so forth 
um and you know um in general really is n't the food that is eaten in israel 
so you you i 'm sure you probably typically think of it like bagels right you know bagels and lox 
um-hum yeah yeah 
turns out you do n't you do n't you do n't really find bagels in israel 
what you find is sort of middle eastern foods 
the same foods that you find in um syria and egypt and everything else 
you find things called have you ever had those 
no 
no no uh kishkes or knishes 
which is oh oh knishes 
no 
you do n't y- you you do n't see a lot of 
that that 's basically eastern european jewish food 
or oh 
it 's it 's very different 
i 'm i i was actually very amazed when i sort of figured this out for myself that everything i grew up with really was n't israeli 
it was more jewish you know 
i got you 
it it it it is very strange 
yeah still get your passover matzi and all that right 
um that that starts tomorrow night 
that 's what i 'm making 
that 's what i 'm doing now 
i 'm making dinner 
oh really 
i dated uh i dated a nice jewish girl for many years up in chicago 
and i was the only goyim at at all the you know seder dinners and everything 
and i used to have to go with rolls of not pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would sell me 
ought to buy the bread from 
that 's great 
well you 've you 've you 've really got a handle on this stuff i 've noticed 
not not yeah not uh 
you got got the vocabulary down and everything 
just just enough to get by 
that that that 's actually real good 
yeah 
we um we actually we have the reverse situation 
turns out that um um most of my friends are n't jewish 
and and and my wife 's not 
okay 
but i but i um i sort of you know do a lot of these things 
so so that um 
seder 's you know our our first seder is tomorrow night 
and this is a rare exception 
there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night which 
and five of them will be jewish 
oh 
two two years ago we had a seder 
we had sixteen people each night 
sixteen seems the magic number for us 
wow 
and i was the only jew both nights so so which to me is wonderful because it means that people who never would get these to see this um so get to see it 
oh really 
and my view is passover is should sort of be 
i- in in in in in my mind passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway because it it sort of predates christ 
yeah 
so 
well they had the 
matter of fact i just watched uh charles heston this uh this weekend in the ten commandments 
oh yeah 
i caught the end of that 
did you 
yeah 
every year i try and catch that 
but yeah 
that 's what always amazes me actually is that um is that you know 
my my wife and i always sort of bring this up about sh- her her being syrian you know and my being jewish and all 
we look alike 
we act alike 
we sound alike 
well not totally alike 
but you know um um it 's amazing to think that people in the middle east sort of all hate each other 
well that 's 
uh to me it 's it 's really um 
i- i- i guess i guess i can intellectually uh kind of come to grips with all of that 
but you know emotionally i have a real difficult time believing that uh that that people that believe in god and and love not war and to forgive can n't get together 
right 
you know i mea- 
i i know that the problems are so deep 
but i mean e- even within the muslim uh religions different sects they can n't get together 
right 
that that 's actually the part that that that i find really strange 
i mean i i i sort of understand somewhat 
i mean i i knowing the history i understand that the hatred of the muslims for you know the israelis or whatever 
and i can sort of handle i can sort of handle that 
and the palestinians but i sort of think about the muslims sort of running around having jihads against themselves 
yeah 
you know i mean and and that seems really weird 
or the uh the the you know the catholics and the protestants up in ireland 
right 
exactly 
you know i mean 
same same thing 
i- i yeah 
i do n't 
i 'll i 'll i 'll never understand it 
uh my view is look what 'd you ever do to me 
yeah 
yeah 
did n't hurt me you know at at at the moment 
so um and and i i do n't know 
there 's a there 's something about there 's a poem somewhere 
i do n't know if you 've ever seen it or not 
um um everything i ever wanted to know i learned in kindergarten 
yeah 
have you ever seen this 
and it talks about how you know if we could just all get toge- you know 
when we were young everything was great because we you know just sort of all went to class together 
and in the mi- you know 
we all had snack time together 
and then we all took naps 
and we all held hands and hugged you know 
and tha- and tha- and that 's what that 's what kindergarten was like 
and would n't it be nice if if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and and took a nap together 
woke up and had snack time you know and then hugged each other a- as we left 
it sounds like a it sounds like a john lennon uh type gosh 
yeah 
i wonder if he secretly did that 
hello 
hi 
hi 
my name 's ken 
hi ken 
my name 's diane 
and um you 're in texas 
right 
yes 
i 'm in san antonio 
everybody 's in texas 
god 
okay i 'm in rochester new york 
everybody else but one has been in texas 
oh 
okay 
well i guess we should get on with this 
okay 
um did you get the message about what it was 
right 
yes 
yeah okay 
go great 
let me just hit the button 
okay um 
do you think that the soviet union represents a threat to us 
i think they 'll always represent a threat wheth- whether or not there 's an active cold war or not uh 
it 's it 's a a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities 
and uh given the the uh military powers on both sides i think it 's always a threat 
yeah that 's interesting 
i do n't 
i- i suspect they 're not our biggest threat anymore 
probably not 
no 
i suspect it 's probably some crazy man like saddam hussein who 's our biggest threat 
right 
but um i wonder if they 're i wonder how much of a threat they are 
i agree with you that that they 'll always be somewhat of a threat given that they have that there 's just it 's just so big 
and there 's just so much military machine there 
um-hum 
and it 's and it 's recognized that the two great powers are us and them 
right 
and and the great powers are always pitted against each other 
but i wonder how much longer they 're going to be a them 
i do n't know 
they they 're going downhill pretty steady 
huh that 's yeah 
but i- i agree right now they 're not 
i do n't believe they 're a large threat right now 
i think there 's always some threat 
uh yeah 
oh i agree 
i mean if we were to if if something were to happen i 'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of for the sake of uh of of unity against us or something if if if need be 
yeah 
but 
actually i feel kind of sorry for them right now because the people are are are uh wanting things that we have that they 're not allowed 
i mean just some basic freedoms 
and and their government is not allowing it 
and gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he 's been trying to push 
yeah 
actually i noticed that i mean th- th- this this most recent scam of his where he said where where he just decided that instead of having uh instead of having i c- i can n't think of the word now um if they 're having demonstrations for in in favor of boris yeltsin he decided well i 'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether 
um-hum 
so i- i- i think that he he he 's actually 
he i think is becoming very dangerous because he 's making those people angry at him 
yeah 
and he 's also i think he 's also making um the military angry at him 
yeah 
i mean i 've heard stories now where the where the um the military is running around 
and they 're sort of getting restless 
and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens you know 
with with the baltic states when they just go in there to beat people up 
yeah 
see i 'm concerned that that since he 's banned demonstrations altogether that he 's going to do the type of thing that happened in tiananmen square 
and he 's going to wipe out no telling how many of his own countrymen uh right in the middle of red square 
um-hum 
and uh it 's going to cause a more civil war than is already occurring 
that 's interesting 
i- i wonder 
i do n't know if he 's 
he he seems 
the thing about gorbachev strikes me that he would n't be that dumb 
i do n't know though 
i do n't know 
i mean and it it might be something that he would n't be able to control 
that 's that that 's that 's something that really true 
that may sort of that military thing i was speaking of before 
um-hum 
i think that 's that 's certainly true 
i mean his military may just go out and say well we just 
gorbachev said you can n't do it 
and we 're just not going to let you do it you know 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
that that 's real scary actually 
yeah 
i mean i- i would suspect their own problems would keep them away from us for awhile 
but it could be real dangerous 
yeah 
we 've got our own worries at the moment 
yeah 
right 
we do n't need to worry about them 
so i guess as long as as uh they 're fighting each other we do n't have to worry about them wasting their time with us 
yes 
but would n't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else 
well sure 
that but that 's a that 's an impossibility i think given the the uh the differences in the world 
yes 
and people are just too different 
well i do n't i do n't know 
i think that un- un- underlying we 're all pretty probably not as as different as everybody thinks 
but unfortunately people people are n't that insightful 
right 
well that 's that 's certainly true i just 
they just see that this guy prays differently and to someone else than i do 
so therefore he 's wrong 
and he 's bad 
and we have to wipe wipe him out 
that 's true 
i was i was discussing with someone before um 
this uh someone before actually one of these calls as a matter of fact about um another topic 
um-hum 
but it came up 
under these um this this this poem everything i wanted to know i learned in kindergarten or something 
uh-huh 
you 've read that one before 
no 
i have n't read it 
i 've heard all about it though 
that this this is the idea that i think is actually very is is what i think we should all revert to 
the idea that um 
basically they said you know everything happened in kindergarten 
and and in kindergarten we learned to share 
and we learned to um play with each other 
we learned to take nap you know and to take naps 
and and whenever we 'd start a fight we 'd all apologize and hug each other you know 
yeah 
and and that would be all 
and if we could just do the same thing sort of with with with everybody else i suspect we 'd we 'd be fine 
yes 
but people grow up 
and they forget 
yeah 
unfortunately 
because because i often i often sort of wonder how having never been to the soviet union um how different the people there really are you know 
h- how mu- 
that 's one of the places i would most like to go 
not right now of course but at at some point i would like to to go to moscow and and to just to see all these things that you can can see on television now and can read about 
everyone always thought of them as you know sort of the yeah 
that ten years ago we did n't have this kind of information i mean we did n't know what things were like 
right 
so 
i would i would love to go there i mean like a- again not now but at some point to go see what what i mean what this is like 
i mean this this is amazing because this is this is an an i mean this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us 
like you said before as well 
so it 'd be interesting to watch 
yeah 
i and i the the people 
i just feel so sorry for the people in the country that they can n't th- i mean they they can n't do any 
they can n't change it 
they try 
and they there 's nothing that they can do 
yeah 
that 's that 's 
and and the ones they even feel somewhat worse for even um 
the ones in like the baltic states where they do n't have a strong leader that you know 
um-hum 
at least at least russia has some sort of strong leader 
i mean they have yeltsin who may who may yet sort of help russia 
yeah 
but um i mean the baltic states i think are just sort of trapped 
i mean they were taken over couple of you know not too long ago and then just sort of told well you 're here now 
yeah 
you 're part of our country 
and you be this way 
uh i- i think it 's a sad state of affairs 
but 
it 's it 's probably not dissimilar from the uh what are they the the the i 'm trying to think of the name of the the something like that in northern iraq who are actually who are actually countrymen of 
oh yeah 
the yeah 
of i mean some of them were split off into israel i believe 
and some of them are in turkey when actually they they do n't they 're their own people and their own beliefs and their own culture system 
um-hum 
right 
and they were split up into three different countries 
um-hum 
yeah 
well that yeah 
and that 
and and they 're very dissatisfied 
and they 're they 're causing wars right now 
and and i do n't think it 's that different from what the baltic states are are going through 
um um actually it sounds very i mean very similar 
they 're sort of being they were sort of forced 
and now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey 
we want our piece 
yeah 
and they have other problems 
they have shiite muslims to deal with as well as saddam hussein 
uh-huh 
i- i mean i think their big problem up there is that they you know is unfortunately 
not only are they th- 
there 's more than one group fighting for the same place 
where they all want you know 
whereas the baltics are saying well we want our own 
we just want this little tiny piece of land 
yeah 
yeah the the one that i think 
one of the wom- women that i work for is married to an iranian 
and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the the countries over there 
um-hum 
and within five or six countries there are probably ten cultures of people 
yes 
yes 
and and that 's they do n't all have their own country 
and and some of them are mad about it 
um-hum 
um actually uh my wife is syrian 
um so i- i also i know some of the history 
oh 
and so forth and and the actually the real funny thing is that i 'm i 'm i 'm jewish 
we 're sort of like the middle east peace talks ourselves 
oh huh uh-huh 
so we i- i know 
that and i 've been to israel 
and i know 
and i sort of toured the area 
and i know that it really is very lots of different cultures in one place i mean and and it 's the same thing i it 's it 's almost the same thing out out in the soviet union right now 
um-hum 
there you know there are 
you can n't take a whole bunch of people who just are n't the same people and do n't want to be together and put them together forcibly 
yeah yeah 
i mean we did it couple of hundred years ago here 
but they wanted to do it 
so 
um-hum yeah 
and i- and i do n't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different 
i really do n't 
i could put the that 's that 's certainly true 
i mean they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs 
right um 
i wonder i wonder if now the people in the soviet union do n't have ideas very different from that so at least that 's poss- 
they they they might 
the the baltic states might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here to to esc- 
okay 
all right 
um i i understand that it 's being proposed as a requirement for uh young people to be to go into public service 
uh-huh 
i think 
yes 
all all young americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means 
yeah 
yeah 
i think that it probably would be a a good program 
i think probably two years is too long 
yep yeah 
i think maybe a year would be the the longest 
prob- 
you 're probably right 
yeah two years is might be a little too long 
tha- yeah 
and you there will be a lot of rebellion in that 
and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i do n't think that they 're going to be serving anybody 
that 's right 
that that would be the problem sure would 
yeah 
so i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who are n't even aware that they can do such a thing to get out there and do so 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it uh you know college credit you know something you know 
yeah 
right 
i 'm not sure what 
but 
right 
college credit is a good idea because 
i- i 'm not sure they need to be you know paid you know 
a super do salary of any kind 
right 
that that kind of takes away from public service 
that 's right 
yeah 
they probably could n't do anything monetary 
but i think giv- giving some kind of college credit 
but just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you need to report somewhere by next monday you know 
i 'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea 
uh-huh no 
i do n't think so either because a lot of people um depending on how the public service programs are set up 
and i 'm not -at that familiar with them to know 
i 'm not either really 
but you know if a lot of people flat can n't afford to 
that 's right 
you know 
that 's right 
that and most kids these days have gotten themselves into um financial situations where they have to be working all the time 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
absolutely 
then you 'll you 'll young families whatever 
so it 's it 's a really tough question 
that 's right 
they jus- they just could n't you know take off to do that 
yeah 
only 
and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that 's that postpones their college for a year 
that 's right 
um-hum 
and that would upset a lot of people too because they just want to get on 
um-hum 
sure would 
there would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think 
yeah 
i you know i think it it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program 
um-hum 
but i i- i think it can n't be something that 's mandatory 
yep 
yep 
it has to be something that 's voluntary you know which is a pretty much the way it is now 
they might 
that 's right 
i 'm not even really sure this point in time you know what what programs are out there 
yeah 
and -at 's the other thing is that you know instead of making it mandatory they may- maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and and uh you know go to the schools and do programs and tell them that we need your help and you know uh uh volunteer for such and such a time 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and you you have a choice of where you want to go 
yeah 
and and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it 
yeah 
like maybe if if there was something you know they could do in their own own you know their own town or city yeah and not to have to pull up roots and you know an- go somewhere half way around the world or something 
yeah 
in their own community 
right 
yeah 
that 's true 
most of them probably would n't do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents 
that 's right 
yeah 
that 's that 's true too 
that 's true too 
but they would have to be supportive in some way 
and i 'm not sure those those programs are available to do that 
bu- yeah 
yeah 
me either 
and you you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know just sit around for their year 
right 
or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind 
right 
exactly 
yep 
it 's tough 
it 's tough 
that 's yeah 
it is tough 
it 's 
a- and i do n't know who 's even proposing it or or how they plan on implementing it if they do 
yeah 
yeah 
i 'm i 'm not sure either 
but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information uh you know disseminated before you say let 's do this you know 
yeah 
yeah 
i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them 
yeah 
you know it 'd be 
it it would n't take up much much it would take up more time than anything 
but it would n't take up a lot of money 
um-hum yeah 
they would n't have to spend money advertising and things like that 
yep 
that 's right 
you go to school 
and you have a kind of a captive audience 
you get them all in the auditorium 
um-hum yeah 
and you you know give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something 
um-hum 
and and i think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded 
yeah 
but they do n't know where to go to to to do anything 
um-hum that 's right 
yeah 
that 's a real waste too 
it really is 
yeah 
it is 
it really is 
i do n't really see the emphasis on things like peace corps like we you know we saw back i guess in the carter administration 
right 
that was that was a big thing with him 
yeah 
yeah 
and i guess even back to kennedy as a matter of f- i guess kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was it you know really interested in things like that 
uh-huh 
b- i just do n't hear much about it anymore 
like i say i do n't even know what programs are are even ongoing now you know 
i do n't either 
that 's what 
anyway it 's a tough question 
yeah 
it is a tough question 
really is you know okay 
well thanks for your time 
enjoyed talking to you 
sure 
same here 
okay 
take care 
ta- you too 
bye bye 
bye-bye 
so what do you think about a year or two of public service 
well i know it 's hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know their carefree years but people that i have known that have done that i like from other countries especially germany and finland um they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life 
uh-huh 
yes 
yeah 
and i think they 're better people because of it 
um-hum 
they 're much more responsible 
i know um the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know 
uh-huh 
they 're encouraged to do that missionary work 
and i be- i really believe that the people that do that are better people and uh make our society better 
you know i- i really agree with you 
um i 
uh though i 've never done that myself i i 'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college 
and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to um very rural children in a very low income district 
and i spent a year teaching there and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from a nice middle class white suburban home and i did it um 
uh-huh 
um-hum um-hum uh-huh 
for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree 
so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree 
but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live someplace else so totally different than my own upbringing and i it changed it probably changed my political views 
hm 
it changed my understanding of the world around me and i think um in fact if if i had to do it all again i you know 
i- i after that you know you never think of it because 
i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i 'd started paying back 
um be- so that was that was one reason why i never considered it 
but now that i 'm further along and i 'm still paying these college loans i- i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because i had them delayed because i 'm back in graduate school at thirty years old 
yeah 
um i 've had them delayed because i 'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the peace corps you can have them delayed uh and i thought that was you know very interesting 
hm 
and i- i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like 
is that is this is that the mormon church that does that 
yes 
yes 
um-hum because one of my neighbors uh did that in pittsburgh from pittsburgh 
but if uh-huh 
and i thought you know that really 
now that i 'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would 've 
probably like you said to be able to travel someplace else whether it be the united states or outside the country i think would 've been a very good um experience for me 
uh-huh 
well i think so 
it puts you out on your own 
and and in a time after high school um there 's kind of a selfishness 
um-hum 
i mean teenagers in our country are kind of kind of a year that parents do n't look forward to and and things like that 
um-hum 
and i think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you 're out on your own trying to um thinking less of your own needs but of other people 
yes 
um-hum 
um-hum 
yeah 
and i think you know we have such a need now you know 
i taught you know 
i- i think i was paid uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district 
um-hum 
and i- i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids um you know 
uh-huh 
every girl i taught except for one was pregnant 
oh no 
many of the boys in the room had children 
and they were they were high school juniors 
um-hum 
and i and i just 
there you know they came from poverty 
they were going to continue in poverty 
and it was it was 
the school district could n't hire many people 
it was very difficult for them to hire 
and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um things i think it 's a really good idea and even if it is overseas 
right 
um-hum 
see i never 
i- i tell you sometimes i worry about things overseas because we have such problems right here in our own country 
yes 
um-hum 
it would really um 
and i do n't 
the people that i 've known like from germany and finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i do n't exactly recommend 
yeah 
um-hum 
yeah 
but still they have benefited from it 
right 
um-hum 
and um you know although i would n't want m- mil- to make people to go off to the military voluntarily 
but it 's it has helped them 
um-hum 
and they are just a lot more mature than the average student 
um-hum 
and 
yeah 
i think it would also help them if they then went on to college 
i know that my first couple of years of college were um uh probably too carefree at the beginning 
um-hum 
and then at the end i had to be too serious 
well that 's right 
a lot of people they flunk out 
or they get they just are so excited to be away from home that they just spend all their time partying 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and they do a lot of things to themselves and that we do n't really want our young people to be doing 
yeah 
that 's true 
and 
um-hum 
that 's right 
um 
i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic uh because it 's something that you know we do n't talk about in this country probably enough 
yeah 
um-hum 
uh you know 
be- because we 're so we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and um having people 
um-hum 
yep 
that 's true 
but you know our 
like in our church it it is you 're free to do that or not you 're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you 
um-hum 
and of course we think it 's helping other people 
oh i think it is 
and so 
i really think i think um people 
you should 
i you know the kids today i teach 
i spend a lot of my time teaching college students and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um their self-centeredness and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
um-hum 
they do n't understand uh how other people live um 
they do n't understand 
and they 're preoccupied with drinking 
um-hum 
yep 
i think that 's uh j- just having a good time 
uh-huh 
and 
i uh 
a friend of mine is a psychologist 
and he always refers to it as uh short-term pleasure oriented 
i guess he 's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it you know 
um-hum 
today 's young people are short-term pleasure oriented 
that 's true 
and everything has to be an immediate reward 
and it has to be fun 
that 's really true 
um-hum 
yeah 
yes 
well i- i do n't know how that would ever happen here 
but at least um 
well they say 
i think i um have read recently that uh the bush administration has increased the uh funding for the peace corps 
oh really 
uh-huh 
because i guess because of the changes in eastern europe uh they 've increased funding for the peace corps 
some of the i guess it 's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known 
um-hum 
when they 're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the peace corps 
hm 
and some of the other overseas programs 
uh 
well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives and friends that um 
um-hum 
i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with what my what i was going to study 
um-hum 
and at least i had some interest in 
a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor 
i want to be a lawyer 
why 
because they make a lot of money 
yes 
yeah 
that 's true 
and they do n't have a goal 
they do n't have a goal 
they do n't have an interest in their own field of study 
um-hum 
they 're just looking what 's going to pay the biggest cash 
yeah 
that 's very true 
you know how many 
is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country 
and i guess 
i- i live near washington 
being in in baltimore it 's something like one in four people in the washington area are lawyers 
um-hum 
area 
yes 
and and i- i just sort of think that 's ridiculous 
yes 
yeah 
with you know with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with aids and cancer and and that how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know 
there 's too many people 
um-hum 
that 's right 
and not enough people want to do that to for uh because of a service that they could provide 
um-hum 
right 
you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um 
um-hum 
but if you 're just doing it because you think that 's the best way to be rich 
um-hum yeah 
you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run 
um-hum 
yeah 
that 's true 
that 's kind of sad 
well anyway 
that 's interesting 
um-hum 
well i guess i better go 
okay 
hey thanks so much for the conversation 
well good luck to you 
i enjoyed it 
well thank you very much 
bye-bye 
thanks 
bye-bye 
okay 
what kind of books do you like to read for enjoyment 
uh mainly the the books i read are uh business related or self improvement 
uh-huh 
um i 've got a a uh small company on the side that i that i do things with 
so uh a lot of the reading that i i do has to do with um how can i uh do better at at my small time business uh important issues such as a you know taxes and business expenses and all those kind things 
what kind of business is it 
uh-huh 
well that sounds interest- that sounds fun 
what kind of business is it 
um i 've got a uh small distributorship uh 
uh-huh 
i uh sell a uh healthy cookie on the side 
really 
and uh i have a few health food stores that i send it to 
i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can 
uh-huh 
so i can get a deal from the uh from the ma- from the supplier 
well that 's interesting 
and then i distributed them 
and then i ca- i get i can sell them at a cheaper price 
plus i 've got a uh drinking water system business that i 've had on the side for years that i 've done 
a what 
a drinking water business uh 
yeah 
oh really 
yeah 
well that sounds interesting 
my mom always wants me to open a health food store 
but i 'll i 'm not really into it 
i do n't know the infor- i do n't know that much about it 
so anyway 
but well that 's interesting 
i personally i like mostly um 
if i had a book of my choice 
i like books 
i go to the library a lot 
and it seems like i always i never go to the fiction section 
i mean that to me is just ridiculous 
it 's like life is to interesting to read fiction 
uh-huh 
but i always get books like um 
i like to quilt 
well i 'm not into quilting 
but i check a lot of books out to learn how 
i just have n't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book 
but i like to um can and do food preservation 
and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff 
and i like to check books out like that 
and i always come away with 
i 'm a christian 
and i enjoy reading books about um 
i li- i have a real heart for people involved in cults and so i have a real you know heart for them 
uh-huh 
and i 'm going to bring my mormon neighbors some amish bread today 
and that 's just where my heart is 
so i read a lot of books on that 
and and you know christian books written by people about you know to help you out and stuff 
and i read the bible 
i do n't read the bible as much as i should 
but but i think i would always think that no matter what i did 
so but i do enjoy reading that 
and so pretty much we have different interests i think in reading 
but and i have a neighbor with a big motorbike 
sounds like it 
and he likes to run down the street with it 
and you you can probably hear him 
but um i do n't know 
so do you enjoy reading anything like that 
um 
uh-huh um i have n't really read anything like that in in in years 
there was a time when i was really into the home things 
uh-huh 
and i did uh had my own garden 
and i did canning all those kind of things 
that was when i was about uh ten years younger 
and uh had 
thirty or younger is that what you said 
about ten years younger 
yeah 
oh ten years younger 
oh that 's funny 
and um uh th- the problem that i 've i 've had in the past with uh my children growing up and moving out of the house and and still having three left at home out of the five um 
uh-huh 
i 've tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in in reading more and and spending more time at the library 
and it i 've been moderately successful uh with my daughter and with my son 
uh-huh 
they both have different interests in books 
but um they they uh they do read them 
um i have some books on on health that i read all the time 
one 's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing 
oh really 
but yeah 
i i 'm uh-huh 
yeah 
maureen solomon 
i had a 
a friend of mine has a book by her right now called foods that heal 
they eat a lot of it you know 
you can take your vitamins 
and she was telling me to take zinc 
so anyway i 've been taking enough zinc you know to kill a horse probably 
i hope it does n't hurt me 
but anyway i did read one chapter of that 
there 's a uh a couple called um 
oh i 'm going to forgot his name now uh 
dirkson 
uh-huh 
um and uh there 's a book called life extensions 
i do n't know if you 've ever heard of it 
no 
i have n't 
okay 
it 's a book called life extensions 
there 's also a book called the life extension extension companion 
uh-huh 
uh dirk pearson and 
oh i forgot sally 's last name 
anyway it 's a couple 
i 've i 've seen them on tv 
and uh they ha- they are pretty down to earth about uh what you can take and and what you can n't take 
and um 
the quantities and 
the quantities what are good for you what is n't and 
what 's the name of it again 
um life extensions 
life extension 
uh yeah 
he 's probably about forty years old now 
um-hum 
i saw him probably seven years ago on johnny carson show and uh i was pretty impressed 
uh-huh 
oh really 
he had a he before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs you know based on how well it was performing 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
and then he embarked on this uh vitamin treatment 
and then every year he had the same tests run 
uh-huh 
and at the age of thirty two i think it was his um heart was that of a fourteen year old and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age 
really 
and of course sally uh is n't a very big woman 
um-hum 
i mean she 's you know she appeared to me to be very petite 
and um she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an s 
oh really 
and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises uh 
together they both exercised about five minutes a day doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises 
really 
i know there 's not any food that you can get 
and it 's grown on good soil hardly anymore 
and i know my my husband 's uncle owns a bi- um some acreage in a eastland texas which is in west texas and he owns a lot of acreage that 's been farmed properly you know and uh we get black eyed peas off of it and stuff 
uh-huh 
yes 
but i know that you know the further we go from adam the worse the food is for you 
but god still somehow makes us all be able to still live 
i think it 's a miracle we 're all still alive after so many generations 
well the last couple of processed foods you know 
i mean but i do n't know 
i like to i like to 
my 
i like to be able to eat really healthy you know 
what am saying and i guess i 'm going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do do n't think we 're going to restore the earth to you know 
uh-huh 
i think jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be 
but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because i 'm always looking down my plate 
and i think man is n't this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment 
but i do take some vitamins on the side 
and i do like reading books like that 
i just i have a hard time 
a lot of the books are real new age oriented like mother earth and we 're going to restore the earth 
i just do n't see that 
i think i mean think to think that is almost 
it 's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the 
you know what i 'm saying 
yes 
it 's to big than us 
and i think god 's in charge 
and god 's going to restore it when he wants to 
so sometimes i get bogged down in the you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking 
but you know there 's a balance in it 
sometimes i read stuff like that 
and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and you know and try and do what 's what i can do out of it that 's practical 
yeah 
but anyway so 
there 's 
i 've i 've read a lot of things um since i got involved in the water business back in eighty three 
uh-huh 
um and it 's amazing that the the legislation they have um for food that does n't apply to water 
they do n't consider water a food and uh the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they would n't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because it 's toxic 
uh-huh 
um chlorine 
because it 's what 
it 's toxic 
it 's a 
oh 
i do n't know if your on city water 
city water has chlorine in it 
chlorine 
uh-huh 
causes cancer 
uh-huh 
they know that 
they 've proven that 
um yet their saying well we 're putting such low doses in there that well you do n't have to worry about dying from it 
uh-huh 
the problem is that i 've i 've read books that uh have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack 
uh-huh 
um 
and if you look at the history of heart attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty 
really 
and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh 
where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water 
really 
you know i bet that 's why we have some friends that eat only 
i just took this amish bread out of the oven 
man it 's going to be good 
i had a starter that friend of mine made 
anyway uh i had a friend that read a book on that 
and um i 've 
all my relatives my m- you know 
you probably read back to eden or something 
i do n't know 
we read a lot 
i know people have read all those books 
but the um 
they dr- they drilled a well i do n't know how many feet 
but it was three or four times deeper than it needed to be 
uh-huh 
and so their water comes out 
they live in grand prairie 
but it 's 
they live kind of in a 
the planes go right over from dfw 
so it 's not real developed 
and so they have a probably half an acre 
yeah 
i 'm very familiar with the area 
and yeah 
and they drilled this well 
and the water comes out at thirty two degrees 
so it 's kinds of neat 
would that be healthier do to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that 
it depends 
a lot of uh a lot of things were thought that uh as you know 
the farmers thought okay we got chemicals 
we 're putting chemicals on the field 
well the ground will naturally filter out the 
okay um 
what do you think about the war recently 
okay the war 
uh-huh 
you mean in terms of the economy 
or 
uh the economy the our soldiers going over uh just everything 
oh 
i thought we were going to talk about social changes 
is that is that what 
you 're kind of directing it 
yeah 
yeah 
oh okay 
okay 
well um well i think it 's caused a lot of you know big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to vietnam 
that 's the first thing i thought of 
i do n't know 
right 
because i mean i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over 
right 
and even people that did n't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that you know and support the soldiers 
right 
and 
so 
i know that uh 
i 've heard people say that you know when people that went to world war two 
you could n't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war 
yeah 
but then in vietnam that was totally different you know 
you could n't be a political figure if you were in vietnam probably 
yeah 
and now if you 've served in desert storm you probably would be a a good candidate 
yeah 
yeah 
it would be like a bonus for your image or something 
ex- exactly exactly 
yeah 
it i 'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income just drastically altered 
oh torn apart 
oh yeah 
we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a just had a new baby 
um-hum 
and uh they would have she would have had to go back to work 
and i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds 
right 
so it 
that 's also a good reason why it it 
or good that it ended as soon as it did 
yeah 
yeah 
i think the biggest change that we 've seen um in in my life or whatever lately is the economy 
oh okay um-hum 
and things are so tight 
and like my husband has n't gotten a raise in two years 
and you know 
exactly 
and it seems like everything is raising every everything that can be cigarette not that i smoke but cigarettes um uh stamps 
yeah 
i mean it seems like ever 
even dog licenses 
i mean 
exactly 
everything single thing that we do is higher you know 
yeah 
yeah 
and they just raised the minimum wage today 
but that 's not like you know as much as they should have raised it i 'm sure 
going to effect too many 
yeah 
yeah 
but uh 
so that 's the hardest thing for us 
and um we 've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home 
we have a three year old and a two year old 
and i 'm trying to stay home as long as i can 
uh-huh right 
but you know every week it gets harder because i could go out and be making money 
right 
right 
you know so that 's a big uh stress i think you know for the social changes in our family 
uh-huh yeah 
i do n't i do n't have any children or anything right now 
i 'm uh i work as a news reporter in waco 
oh 
and so i get to see i got to see a lot of not firsthand but uh probably a good part of the war um as far as what people thought about it and a lot of things like that 
i see 
uh-huh 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
well it 
it was kind of amazing 
people were coming to me to ask me you know what 's going on you know like i knew or like i sat in on the meetings or something 
yeah 
you have an inside track or something 
yeah 
yeah 
so i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in in the war and everything 
so that was pretty interesting 
yeah 
yeah 
let 's see 
what other social changes in the past ten years 
oh i guess between men and women i 've seen a lot of changes in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career be mom be everything superperson 
yeah 
exactly 
be everything be supermom 
exactly 
yeah 
because i know you know i i really get pressure from because i have a career also 
uh-huh 
and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am i staying home you know whereas before that never would have happened 
right 
and 
where as it would have been 
people would have said why are you going to work 
exactly um 
so that 's kind of a difference for us 
i think there 's more pressure to um not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family 
right 
so he 's 
the roles are changing a lot 
yeah 
he 's gotten a lot uh you know 
you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all 
but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up 
uh-huh right 
so it 's now he has the pressure too of being super dad and super career 
and 
and even you know i think a lot of the movies we see now kind of kind of play a good part in our changes 
because you see that they have the three men and a baby type movies 
yeah 
that 's true 
and i think you know to 
mister mom and 
yeah 
and then you have the women uh detectives now and you know different roles just in what we see 
uh-huh 
and so we probably want to do that even more now you know since the women 's movement in the we- seventies 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
and you know we 've come a long way 
but i think it 's still a still good ways to go 
yeah 
yeah 
so 
i think there 's still 
i i know that um 
i grew up in chicago in the sixties and was part 
uh-huh 
my family was real liberal 
and i think there 's a lot of um kind of myths that we 've come a long way just in terms of our society and race relations and things like that 
right 
and you know i think there 's so much prejudice still there 
yeah 
and it 's kind of more covert now 
people used to be more clear and say you know well i believe in this or i believe in that 
exactly 
exactly 
and now you know i think there 's still tremendous amount of prejudice 
it 's just not as 
but people think oh we 're in the nineties we 're beyond all that you know 
exactly 
but it 's 
i mean like i say we 've come a long way 
but we have i mean twice as far to go still 
yeah 
yeah 
and i do n't think a lot of people you know realize a lot the plight of a lot of people 
yeah 
you know and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you 
but there 's so many more people that are homeless 
but there 's so many more people exactly that you do n't even and that you do n't even see or know about 
and 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's real easy to get isolated in your own little community 
oh oh yeah 
you know because wh- when i was growing up in chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood 
and there were people from all first generation chinese german you know all different nationalities and everything 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and now we 're kind of like in lewisville miss white little suburbia you know 
yeah 
i mean i do n't even know anybody that you know from any place other than texas hardly you know 
yeah 
i grew up in in brooklyn new york 
oh boy 
and so i was just i was just surrounded you know by black people 
yeah 
because i 'm black 
and so you know i lived that 's where i lived 
yeah 
and so now i i feel lucky actually because i 've almost lived around everyone 
i 've i went to ut to college 
oh 
and so they you know they have a lot of different people go there different kinds of people 
yeah 
and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people do n't get to see 
yeah 
you know some people have lived in lewisville all their life you know 
yeah 
and that they they think the whole world is like that 
and so they do n't get to see 
exactly 
and that 
we lived in a dorm 
my husband and i met in graduate school at indiana university 
uh-huh 
and i was ours was uh international co- you know coed dorm 
uh-huh 
and there were twelve hundred students 
they 're graduate students from all over the world 
and once we came here it was like gosh i just miss that 
exactly 
because it really is exciting to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds 
it is 
we got invited to 
one guy practically roasted a goat in his in his dorm 
oh my gosh 
if he was from iran or some place 
i do n't know where 
but um you know 
well there 's so many people who have never you know even gotten to do that 
yeah 
so that 's great 
yeah 
my sister was telling me she met a gi- 
she 's going to the university of pennsylvania in in philadelphia 
oh uh-huh 
and uh she just met a girl from um i think barbados or jamaica or something like that 
oh 
and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time and everything 
yeah 
and she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars 
yeah 
so my sister had to take her shopping and you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors 
and i just thought that was so very exciting you know to go and and just witness you know this girl just coming to america type thing you know 
oh gosh 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
really 
so you know i would have loved it the opportunity to do that 
that is part of the change i think that i 've seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now kids have to have so much 
but 
i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids even though i buy most of the things at garage sales for their christmas 
oh yeah 
uh-huh 
i mean people ha- you know think they 're kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys 
they think they have to have everything they have to have the latest cereal about you know just 
oh yeah 
it 's just 
yeah 
that 's ridiculous too 
when i first moved here i was only thirteen 
but everyone had a car in school you know 
oh gosh 
and i could n't and i just could n't believe you know 
i was from new york 
and so you know we rode the bus 
yeah 
me too 
and if you had a ca- 
in chicago we did n't i did n't even date a guy that had a car until i was in college 
yeah 
exactly 
and if you had a car there was nowhere to park it anyway 
or you know it 's just you just did n't have a car 
yeah 
but then we came here 
and they had parking lots in the schools 
and i could n't understand it 
yeah 
you know all the kids had cars 
yeah 
and they you know have to have a car 
oh gosh 
so that was 
my kids are going to be hating me 
i guess i 'll give them a bike and say here 's it 
yeah 
yeah 
ri- 
till you can afford to pay the insurance you know 
really 
or live really close to school and have them walk 
yeah 
no 
but uh yeah 
kidding 
a lot of changes 
yeah 
so 
well did we cover it everything 
i think so 
okay 
i guess i 'll get back to my laundry 
okay 
well it 's good it 's good talking to you 
you too 
good luck 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
i i ass- i assume you have kids 
uh we have one 
she 's only nine months old 
oh well she she does n't have to worry about public schools yet 
right 
well my degree is in teaching 
so 
ah 
well we have a little bit of a basis for conversation 
i was a substitute teacher for about a year 
so i oh really 
yeah 
i uh thought i wanted to be a teacher 
so but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it 
um-hum 
and they uh 
in alabama where i came from they they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree 
so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me 
did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels 
or 
yeah 
it was 
i just took grades one through six 
um-hum 
i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids wrong 
well my degree was in fourth through seventh grade 
but i taught junior high 
and i expected it to be a lot of trouble 
but it was n't that bad 
i taught remedial reading kids 
um 
and well they do n't call it remedial reading these days they call it something else 
um yeah 
but but anyway at the time that 's what i taught 
and um you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way when you have your slow readers 
hum 
but it it was n't too bad 
we we got along real well 
hum well i i sometimes wonder if i did n't mess up 
i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can if you have to you can get mean with them 
those little kids do n't understand it 
yeah 
i 
especially with the real young ones 
i started out wanting to teach elem- lower like primary and then top primary and thought well no i do n't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth 
grade and so that 's what i got my certification in 
um-hum 
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools 
yeah 
um and my reason for that was i do n't like the uh what 's the right word the varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools 
well that 's a nice way of putting it 
you can find a lot of good public schools if you if you look real hard 
but i do n't think they could cover everything that you could teach your children on an individual basis 
exact- exactly 
and two most people do n't have that option 
yeah 
you know and plus it also depends on the district you 're in as i mean on the 
i 've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it does n't matter what you do uh accept for the private ones of course we 're talking about public 
um-hum 
right 
i do n't know 
back when i was going to school uh you just did n't get away with things these kids get away with now 
um-hum 
i mean you you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal 's office and usually bending over to get five of the best 
yeah 
um but now nowadays they can n't even they can barely scold the children for something y- you know without getting sued 
and the the um the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the the lower the lower schools 
oh yeah 
well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class 
and uh this kid comes to school with his lunch box 
and inside this lunch box he 's got easily two i 'd say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills 
um 
and i asked him uh what are you doing with that 
he says my father gave it to me 
and i did n't believe it for a minute 
um-hum 
um so uh but uh you know the 
not a lot i could do about it 
right 
can n't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants 
crazy for him to 
but 
well i have 
i i 've fully 
i think i understood what the what the kid was doing he was a uh 
well let 's just say he was one of those types that you would n't doubt that he was selling something 
um-hum 
yeah 
but not a lot i could do about it 
well we had the problem when i was in 
with teaching um 
i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with 
and if we did have a a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there 
um-hum 
and you do n't know if you were reaching them or not 
but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was bett- trying to teach them was better than have them taken out 
yeah 
because uh that just 
that does n't do a lot for them 
i mean it alleviates your problem 
yeah 
but it does n't do anything for them 
right 
uh most the time if they were they were 
some of them were even better behaved 
i 've only had two instances where i cou- it was really noticeable 
but they were better behaved when they were um 
i do n't know if it was alcohol or something else that they were on 
but it ended up better 
but 
uh i do n't know 
guns and 
i do n't know 
that 's something 
i think there 's a problem too with teachers trying to um to be so versatile that they do lose sight of the basics you know 
they 've been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics 
um-hum 
and uh and i 'm not completely just you know just teach the basics in schools 
but i think there d- does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our our lowering grades in the standardized test and such 
oh yeah 
yeah oh sure 
i mean i- i- it 's indicative across the board that we we 've done something wrong 
but right 
and when you see uh koreans and chinese and japanese who are taking all the uh science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs 
and you know here we are 
we can n't we can n't balance a checkbook without a calculator 
um-hum 
um i do n't know 
well i spent a year and a half in japan also 
and i 've seen how their school system works 
and i 
they go by a complete rote system 
you you just memorize everything 
um-hum 
and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out 
and the better uh memorizer you are the better your grades going to be 
yeah 
so i do n't completely agree with that either 
no 
but there there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere 
yeah 
that 's that 's a great deal what law school 's like 
oh is it 
yeah 
is that what you ended up going into 
um yeah 
oh 
and uh i just same sort of thing 
they just 
you you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases 
and then you get one exam for the whole semester and it 's how well you can remember it all 
um-hum 
how how much you can stuff in your brain 
yeah 
and i found that a particularly useless way of studying 
yeah 
um i never did 
i always tried to understand things not tried to memorize 
um-hum 
and consequently some of the very best students were had excellent memories 
but they could n't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned 
um-hum yeah 
so 
yeah 
uh it did n't show me anything 
a year and a half i gave it up 
i was n't really want 
i did n't want to be a lawyer anyway just wanted the degree 
um-hum 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
well 
well 
i do n't know 
what can we do about it 
goo- good question 
probably 
money money is not the answer 
taking 
no 
there 's plenty of money in the system 
yeah 
it 's just 
i mean th- they 're throwing more money at it now than ever before 
and things are getting worse 
i think it 's uh like a lot of things in the in the the united states 
we 've got so much built up in um in the s- in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it 
um-hum 
and in the the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again 
and there 's no way that that can be done 
um-hum 
not without wiping out a whole generation of of kids in the school system 
um-hum yeah 
and so 
yeah 
maybe on smaller smaller scales 
well i do n't know 
i uh 
as much as i did n't like school when i was going through it from my perspective now i can see that it 's a lot better than what we have now 
um-hum 
and i think part of it is that they 've got to give authority back to the local school 
yeah 
you know i mean i- it 's silly that these that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline 
um-hum 
right into the classroom it needs to be be able to be enforced 
yeah 
exactly 
i mean i i- i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something to students because they 're going get they 're going to get complaints or they 're going to get sued or something 
um-hum 
it 's like doctors in lawsuits 
oh yeah 
you know they 're kind of fearful of everything 
well lawyers help create that 
that 's that 's 
true i 've well at least i 've heard that 
i i i have n't fortunately been in a situation where it 's been applicable to me 
but but 
well i think i think i i mean what we 've turned the schools into now are just day care centers you know somebody 
okay 
we 're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day 
and he 's out of our hair 
um-hum right 
and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents 
um-hum 
you know they just 
oh yeah 
it has to be reinforced in the home 
oh sure 
i m- 
mean you you can you can have the best school system in the world if you do n't get any- anything at home then it 's it 's not going to help either 
yeah 
right 
so i i do n't know 
i do n't know 
what the i do n't know what the answer is 
um-hum 
it 's an interesting interesting thing you want to do 
i 
how is texas about keeping your children out of public schools 
do they allow it 
yeah 
they allow it under certain circumstances 
you have to to prove that you 're teaching them something 
you have to follow a preferred curriculum 
um-hum 
um well they try to encourage you to to follow a specific curriculum although you do n't have to 
um-hum 
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be they 're kind of monitored 
you know they they will allow you to 
i can n't think of any examples 
but certain religious groups do n't want their children in public schools because the influence 
and maybe if they was a group of mennonites or something like that 
um-hum 
i do n't think they 're is in in this area 
but um they they are monitored by the uh by the state school board 
hum 
so 
that 's interesting 
i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when some people first tried that and they got sued got taken to court by the school system 
um-hum 
i 'm glad the parents won 
i mean that 's seems silly that uh i mean we started 
that 's the that 's the way you got your education in this country 
um-hum 
and then uh 
hi 
hi uh 
as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i uh took on a painting project in my bathroom 
and i had wallpaper up 
i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that 
and it took me all weekend 
because uh the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down 
and that had to dry 
and then the spackling had to dry a day 
and then the painting took another day 
you did n't try we rewallpapering 
you just uh 
no 
i i just painted 
did you use a textured paint 
or 
uh no 
actually the wall behind the paper was smooth 
so i just used a like a semigloss 
um 
and 
well did you get good results 
well no 
not really 
i need to 
it it looks so bad our you can see where those spackling marks were 
yeah 
i need to uh either paper back over it or do something 
but just did n't it did n't it did n't cover it 
yeah 
it covered the spots pretty good 
but it did n't excuse me it did n't uh uh it just did n't look as smooth as i wanted it to 
well we did a uh 
we moved oh last august 
and we 're getting a house 
my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den 
and we decided 
we went to i 've forgotten one of the paint stores 
and they just said oh you can get by 
and i forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark 
uh-huh 
well more or less 
after about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable 
but it kept 
the the dark 
it was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling and uh it was smooth 
uh-huh 
and uh and we would we put this stuff on 
and and it supposedly textured it or or did something to it 
and but because of the th- dark behind it was really really hard to cover 
and 
was it like a primer 
yeah 
it was something like that although we sort of when we got through i wished we had n't done it 
because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it 
and we were painting it and trying to do uh you know make it 
and it it really was you know 
the advice they give you is uh 
the job was considerably tougher than we thought 
would you put a huh uh-huh yeah 
uh particularly when you try to 
i was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood paneling 
and uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate 
and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot paneling 
and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something 
oh my goodness 
that 's an awful lot 
have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted 
not inside 
now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it 
that was one of the requirements from you know fha that the house be painted before we bought it 
yeah 
and it was fairly reasonable 
we have a brick house 
but all the trim around the house was uh 
yeah 
if i remember right it was like uh five hundred dollars 
oh that 's quite reasonable 
yeah 
yeah 
so that was n't too bad 
um the problem is 
have you have you tried matching paint lately 
no 
i have n't 
my wife 
we we built a shed over the long way 
actually it took 
this is not on the topic 
but i did finish it 
but my wife went to the uh home depot i think it was and and took a uh a copy of took a piece of brick and she wanted to paint the shed 
uh-huh 
it 's a it 's a wooden shed uh 
and she took it 
and they 've got this machine that matches the color of paint 
uh-huh 
and uh they got 
and uh and in fact she put some right ba- 
she got 
they mixed uh a gallon of it 
and uh it 's just remarkable how close it will match the paint uh 
and it does it uh oh electronically some something magic 
oh 
so they did do a good job 
yeah 
you know they 
it but it 's electronic 
yeah 
uh you put your sample under this thing 
and it looks at it and and uh and determines the 
and it it 's really remarkable 
uh the problem they had 
and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim 
uh-huh 
and uh but they did n't did n't occur to them that um that they could have taken a sample um from 
uh-huh 
i forgotten 
this is sherwin williams paint or something 
but anyway it 's it 's remarkable 
that 's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the you know 
you want this you want this to look like this 
and you want that to look like that 
and of course if it 's all white you 're all right 
uh-huh 
but when you start getting into colors 
have you had problems getting colors to match 
yeah 
yeah 
as a matter of fact uh what we 've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a uh a blue 
and the blue even so many years two years later or so it does n't match you know 
um 
so 
the very same type of paint and everything 
gosh 
so 
so you 
so what 's your 
what 's the solution then 
oh i have no idea 
i repainted the whole thing 
oh my 
well at least you 'll get very good at it right 
yeah 
you could go back and and paint the whole thing over 
yeah 
that 's uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting 
because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do 
i 'll just do a little bit here and a little that 
yeah 
although the uh 
it 's uh it 
we almost one day 
we we painted the house to uh 
we painted we painted the whole inside 
and it had all this dark trim 
we thought uh you know 
we did the one wall but the other trim 
i 'm trying to think 
i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh 
they do n't do that in the newer houses now 
we do n't 
yeah 
uh the mold everything is white 
in a new house everything is white 
that 's right white 
yeah 
that 's what we 're trying to get ours to look like 
oh good luck 
we wound up selling the house 
yeah 
actually i i do n't know whether it made 
actually it does 
it 's interesting that the white um makes the rooms look bigger 
one of the 
in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames i do n't know what you call that that actually that are along the walls that you know up a couple of feet 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue 
oh i see 
and uh it makes the room look remarkably smaller 
huh she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what co- 
the trim is still white 
okay 
the the molding but by 
white 
uh-huh 
and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive 
yeah 
but it makes the room look smaller which is uh uh which is 
yeah 
it explains why they why they have everything white 
but i you would n't think that i 
yeah 
well maybe maybe somebody that understands colors would know all of that stuff 
yeah 
but 
well uh what about the lighting 
did it make a big difference 
uh not particularly 
because the house has so many windows uh it has 
oh uh-huh 
the the the living room has four uh good size windows 
and uh well of course at night 
but with the 
we have we have we have a soccer field that 's um oh about a hundred yards from our house 
uh-huh 
and the lights shine right at our house 
it 's kind of 
we did n't know that when we bought the house 
but 
so that uh 
you get some 
the color does n't really matter for because you have that light 
yeah 
we have a lot of light 
yeah 
and well it it it um well it 's just uh i think it 's just the the the dark blue to about three feet 
and then above that we left it white 
so anyway it did n't it did n't change 
all time oh i see 
but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and and scrape some of that away 
it did n't 
it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic we 're we 're really on to that that the masking is 
uh-huh 
you have to do that very very carefully 
and it takes a long time 
that 's right 
you can work yourself to death 
well i 'm sorry to hear your color did n't come out so good over the weekend 
yeah 
really 
no kidding 
it 's kind of frustrating 
it is 
a lot of work 
a lot of work 
well i 've got to go to a meeting 
it 's been good talking to you 
nice talking to you 
okay 
good-bye 
thanks a lot bye 
i do n't know 
i grew up uh in the the sixties 
and at that time uh it was uh a changing time for the whole music scene i guess 
and i grew up with the beatles and the rolling stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it i guess for several years after i graduated from college and and thereafter 
but have since uh 
since i grew up in a small town in in southern oklahoma 
i have kind of gone back to uh more of a county uh flavor in music 
um i 'm not quite sure why that is 
and it seems like almost a an opposite 
but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pop uh sounding music 
it did n't have what you know i guess what i was looking for at the time country tells more of a a story 
it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up 
and i 've i 've become i guess more of a country fan over the years 
when you say that you grew up uh in the sixties i take it that was the uh teenage type years 
or uh 
yeah 
that was my teenage years 
i was born in fifty 
and and uh 
okay 
we we 're very similarly aged 
so we probably have an in- an interesting perspective on the music on the times 
so i 'm just a couple years older than you 
yeah 
uh essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that i for one reason or another i did n't pay much attention to music 
but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me 
uh my early popular music interests were in simon and garfunkel whom i saw perform when i was in college 
and i became attached to that style of uh urban urban country if there is such a thing 
yeah 
i think with uh in a way one could talk about simon and garfunkel that way because they do tend uh to have a dramatic or story approach to their music uh usually tend to have some sort of good or bad moral to it 
uh over time i became very interested in in baroque classical 
and i think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it it very relaxing for me 
my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat uh simon 
it 's something that interests me uh combined with with the classical tastes i had mentioned 
and my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds early eighteen hundred music 
i 'm not a not a music um 
i 'm not particularly schooled in it 
i know what i like to listen to as far as classical music 
and i i spent a good deal of time listening also to uh people from the late seventies really um neil diamond for instance um people of of that particular time 
that 's kind of the way i am 
i listen to some country and western 
but i 'm not sch- schooled in it 
and i i 've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it 
i played a little bit of piano 
i 've i continue to think that 
i want to do it 
and i never have the discipline to stay with it 
but when i do play uh and and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a for a new piano player 
it is it 's got uh basically an easy uh rhythm and and tone 
right 
and it 's it 's pretty fairly well easily to uh uh something to fall into 
i 'm kind of the say way 
i i 've gone through different periods of life uh in music from from pop to classical 
i guess one of the things was that influenced me was that i i 've worked in radio stations as a dj for all my college years trying to support my way through there 
and supp- 
was support 
was uh influenced by all different kinds of music 
but basically because that 's where i worked 
and i 've developed a real love for uh classical music in probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was uh heavy into classical type music 
he said he used to sit on saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music uh that they were using behind them because they used especially disney used a lot of classical music behind the cartoons 
and so consequently we wind up wound up playing a lot of classical music there 
and i think that uh got deep seated into me 
one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is uh are those that call on those classical uh roots i guess uh barry manilow comes to mind for some reason there 's there 's not a whole lot of his stuff that i 'm real crazy about 
but he does have some things 
chicago had some things 
right 
uh and i think even electric light orchestra had some some real um influences by classical music 
and i 'm still still 
my favorite 
in fact most of my cds that i got are classical music 
i find it very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy i particularly like the music 
i do n't know which is chicken and egg in that situation 
uh a good example would be uh 
i have connections but but uh not particularly deep ones to the vietnamese war type situations 
uh and i found that i really like china beach 
and i particularly like tour of duty 
and both of them i had as much fascination of the background music i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows 
yeah 
uh and and i 've uh thirty something i 'm particularly interested 
but it 's the music almost that i find myself listening to 
yeah 
i 'm kind of thinking that that 's maybe 
our generation was uh so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with uh things now with the music that 's behinds them 
that could well be 
i i uh spent my junior year uh and sophomore and junior year in in college when i 
a song by the uh uh 
i think the title of it was just downtown 
uh-huh 
uh and if you recall how it goes downtown da dah dah dah 
right 
uh all i have to do is hear that song and i get you strongly evoked memories of of difficult times in school being behind on work 
yeah 
uh and my family now knows if they come into my study and uh i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i 'm trying to get a project done uh at school uh and i 'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know to just stay away 
that 's their signal 
they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it 
yeah 
that 's right 
did when did you first take your uh your first piano lesson 
uh probably about first grade 
yeah 
and i have uh returned about every four or five years to thinking that i would like to to do something about it 
i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes 
and then inevitably i am swept away by the the pressure of other types of things 
yeah 
uh 
it is a time consumer 
it is 
in order to continue to to grow and 
i i always think that i 'll be able to do it 
and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really can n't quite understand what it is that other people take for granted in composition themes 
yeah 
and i 
keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times i bang on them 
i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what 's involved 
right 
uh but in a in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude 
and i keep thinking gee i thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand 
but it does n't for me 
no 
it 's making that uh that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it 
i was never able to to master all that 
in fact my brother and sister both they were oh thirteen sixteen years older than i they went through the uh parent thing where you 've got to practice or you 're not going out to play thing 
and when it came to my turn the folks said no we 're not going through that again 
they sold the piano 
and is the turns out i was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to 
so i 
uh-huh 
that 's one of things i felt like i missed in life 
and i i really 
in fact uh one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to chopin that is played on uh piano 
i just you know i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that 
oh 
maybe one of these days i 'll 
you know i 'm kind of like you maybe one of these days i 'll get around to it 
i 'll do something with the piano 
but probably not 
so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance uh 
just never got a chance to come out 
no 
that 's the most fascinating thing 
well it 's a pleasure talking with you 
and you sir 
best 
you take care 
of luck in your graduate school 
okay 
bye-bye 
good-bye 
um what kind of house do you live in 
uh we live in a one story just like a ranch style home you know the the standard texas uh fox and jacobs 
oh yeah 
with with a yard and fence 
how about you guys 
are you in a hou- apartment or a house 
i 'm in an apartment in uh plano 
well they say that those are easy to fin- or difficult to find 
yeah 
they are if uh 
kind of depends on what you 're looking for 
mine 's just a one bedroom place 
that 's uh 
how are rents doing 
i have n't looked at rents in a long time 
uh it 's hard for me to tell because i have n't rented in uh probably twenty twenty five years and uh just 
uh-huh 
i 'm getting back into apartment life 
and it 's 
what 's a what 's a one bedroom 
are you in a um well plano 
yeah 
most most complexes in plano are pretty nice 
so you 're probably in a you know 
but well they vary from from place to place 
it 's hard to tell you know how well they 've been kept up how old they are 
um-hum 
and these are probably oh 
one of the nicest that i found 
and uh they 're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place 
ooh that does get high 
yeah 
i mean 
yeah 
it does considering that you know you uh house payments are not a whole lot more than that 
yeah 
i was going to say our mortgage is is between depending on you know 
it it drops um 
seems like in the last six months we um got lucky 
and we refinanced 
and it but it was like eight hundred and something 
but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty so that 's really not 
yeah 
i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a townhouse in yeah in 
wow 
that 's a lot for a townhouse 
actually they 're near plano in north dallas too 
but i could n't believe it 
but you know 
but that 's what happens when you get up in this area you know 
you got all these companies are up here 
and these they i guess they know they 're going to get it 
yeah 
and then i think that um nobody was really buying homes for a long time there because of just 
i mean we 've been in ours for about ten years 
but uh there 's no investment in it you know all it allows you to do is itemize on your on your taxes yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
you just take off your mortgage interest and that 's about it 
that 's really about it 
it 's uh 
have you ever owned your own home 
yeah 
oh yeah i 've owned uh several and built several 
so you know what it 's like 
yeah 
it 's like when you first 
this is our third one 
it 's not um 
and it 's not that exciting after a while 
uh well well and especially around north dallas or at least in plano area they basically all look alike because fox and jacobs 
yeah 
suburban track 
yeah 
we uh we lived out of state for a while and came back 
and uh we lived in a smaller city 
and now we say gee dallas really is big and polluted 
and is n't it 
i can remember i 've only been here eight years but i can remember coming to work from 
i used to live in wylie and i could see downtown dallas 
uh-huh 
and now there 's this brown haze over it 
and it 's moving north 
yeah 
it 's really it 's really sad because they 're they 're not doing anything 
well we 're getting off the subject i guess 
but just like with housing i mean they 're not doing anything about pollution 
they 're not doing anything about 
it 's going to look like 
hou- have you ever been to houston 
oh yeah 
you know um i used to think dallas was better than houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a 
yeah 
now it looks just like houston to me 
yeah 
it does 
h- how long have you been in this house 
you know we 've been in here ten years 
ten years 
yeah 
so we 've got you know we 've got some investment in it 
but you really do n't get anything out of it 
no 
you really do n't 
were you said you were out of state for a while 
was that a smaller town than than dallas area 
yeah 
smaller 
we were up in pittsburgh pennsylvania 
how were the how were the house prices up there 
my home town 
um the prices actually a lot better because pittsburgh is about the size i 'm trying to think like a louisville or minneapolis that type of size 
yeah 
and the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy five eighty 
wow 
yeah 
it 's really 
and we did n't think it was that clean 
but then after you 're gone for a while it looks cleaner you know um 
hum oh yeah well you know a lot of these people that i 've talked to that are coming down from uh like what i call the back east especially from jc penney uh are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy five thousand dollar houses down here 
yeah 
saint louis whatever 
and they 've wind up getting better houses here than they had there so in a way i guess it works both ways 
really 
i guess it 's 
yeah 
but and here i guess it depends on what you want you know 
here once people like i know a lot of people that work for jc penney in marketing and a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you 're talking about they had no um they had a lot of property but not a lot of house 
you know yeah 
and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it but but they love it 
that 's a fact 
i mean they they they think that they 're getting you know 
you say um sun room to them 
and you enclose and you can sell 
i guess that 's true 
yeah 
and they do n't have to worry about yard upkeep because they do n't hardly have any 
yeah 
and a lot of them i know a couple women that work there 
and they do n't miss in public relations and they do n't miss having a basement to run up and down to you know 
that 's true 
there 's not too many basements in texas 
and i said you have n't heard about tornados 
how about bugs you know 
yeah 
gosh i remember when i was little uh we did n't have a 
i lived grew up in southern oklahoma and uh people across the street had a cellar 
uh-huh 
and w- we never did 
and it 's just like dallas area 
it was tornado alley up there 
and every spring mom would drag me up at three oclock four oclock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street 
and we 'd go into the cellar 
and i to this day i do n't care if i go or not you know 
yep 
if it 's going to get me it 's get me 
that 's exactly uh 
growing 
i grew up in western pennsylvania near pittsburgh 
and uh we used to call the basements actual cellars 
so it 's funny to hear that word because i never hear it you know 
it 's like the back porch used to be a stoop you know but uh um the housing is just 
yeah 
we like the older homes 
and i do n't know if we 're going to stay here or not 
depends you know i mean 
yeah you ever thought about building a house 
pardon me 
you ever thought about building a house 
yeah 
actually when we were up north um 
but some family things changed 
so we ended up coming back down here and all that because it helped my husband 's work 
but um we really would like to 
but we do n't know if we 're going to do it unless we stay here you know 
yeah 
that 's true 
especially well 
well ti is like anybody else 
you never know how long you 're going to be here or be in one place you know 
it yeah 
it it 's real tough 
i mean the economy any more 
i mean i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything you know 
yeah 
it 's 
do you work 
um pardon me 
do you work 
yes 
i do 
so how do you handle 
do you got any kids 
uh no 
we do n't 
so you got 
he 's working and you 're working and you got this big house to take care of 
how do you manage both of those 
uh how do i take care of the house 
well i do n't have a mexi- 
i do n't i should n't say that 
i do n't have an ethnic maid 
yeah 
i do n't have 
we have some friends that live near north dallas off of campbell road 
and they have like a four thousand square foot home 
and she 's got a uh a live out nanny 
um but any rate i do n't have any of that um 
i do n't know 
it 's really not too difficult with no children and just two people you know 
you basically can take care of everything yourself 
we have a 
yeah 
we have a dog 
and we 're pretty 
i mean we 're not fanatically neat 
but um we keep things up you know it 's not like where there 's three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to um get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring 
yeah 
yeah 
what about home repairs and stuff 
do you have to do all that yourself 
or 
um no 
we 're pretty much um 
we we 've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wallpaper together and things like that 
wow you too 
um we pretty much hire 
we subcontract mostly everything i mean other than anything that 's not a um 
yeah 
i mean i know how to fix a running toilet he does what he needs to 
yeah oh yeah 
but mostly if it 's something major um you know cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that 
yeah sounds like you you 've already got the makings for being a general contractor 
yeah 
no thanks 
i 
yeah if you do n't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together 
have you ever done that 
i mean you sound like you may have been a couple one time 
yeah 
i built three houses in my life 
and oh they the the building process was a lot of fun but puts a lot of strain on things 
and how 'd that go 
uh-huh 
getting to agree to things 
that i 'm sure 
and i also think that once you get to be um you know certain when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older you start um the dollar value on things i you know i think people that own homes a lot in north dallas are very materialistic 
ye- 
you bet 
oh you bet 
i know i 'm supposed to talk about homes 
but people that o- the people that own them are the home homes themselves 
and you know um spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just does n't 
oh yeah 
well to some of them i guess it does n't matter you know that maybe they 've got enough coming in to to take care of it 
yeah 
that 's 
i mean and and you know you see a lot of these people that came east from uh west from uh from new york with exxon or jc penney 
and it 's just a hoot to watch them 
but hum um-hum oh yeah they 
as far as they 're concerned they 've come to the promised land you know 
they 've got it made 
right 
right 
exactly 
so well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house 
already oh yeah 
because you 're combine uh confined by space you know 
i had a i came out of a thirty one hundred square foot two story h- house 
oh my goodness yeah 
and i had room for everything 
in fact i had more room than i knew what to do with 
i do n't know it 's it 's seems like room uh stuff always expands to fill a- available space 
uh-huh 
but uh 
yeah 
well in a way you can travel light 
yeah 
you can yeah you know 
you l- you adjust 
you figure out 
how is how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that 
it 's not as bad as i thought it was uh it 's not as bad as i remembered 
uh-huh 
especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be 
yes 
i do 
uh there seems to be a a more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where i am uh even though you know there 's kids all around 
and there 's there 's traffic 
and there 's people going up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that 
but still uh 
everybody pretty much kee- keeps keeps to their own turf so to speak 
yeah 
pretty much 
and uh there 's never really any 
any oh i remember in school there 's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you do n't run into that up here i think i think because there 's so many uh professional people if you want to call them that uh that go spend all day at work 
yeah 
uh-huh 
and they want to come home 
and they want some quiet 
yeah relax and try to go to sleep 
really 
yeah 
yeah yeah you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes or playing ball or jogging 
or doing this and that 
and uh they 're trying to to unwind 
and i think plano in general is getting a little more 
well it 's gotten so big it 's almost a town in it 's own right 
oh yeah 
it 's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that 
is n't that something 
yeah 
the price of home 
now we paid oh we paid um about seventy eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago 
and i 'd say they appraised it 
it 's gone up you now maybe like five percent so it 's an investment 
yeah oh yeah 
but it 's something that you know 
when you 're first married or starting out you think if you really have something 
but you really 
it 's just real 
nowadays with the way income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize 
oh you bet 
and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things 
and uh you 're always paying for something 
yeah 
exactly 
we 
yeah 
and even you know 
i mean like we had i called them prefabs just a track home you know 
i mean we we had one of their homes that was nicer in pennsylvania 
but um it was an older home 
but then you buy an older home and you 're always fixing things up 
you know um-hum oh you are constantly 
there 's always something going wrong 
so you know 
so well you- you- you 're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose 
i suppose i do because i 've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last genera- well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from 
uh-huh 
well take it back thirty years 
i 'm going back too far from my parents generation when mom stayed home period an- and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless 
yeah 
if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married 
yeah 
and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know 
yeah 
if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it until the kids you were little 
yeah 
you you were n't supposed to want a job 
yes 
there was not there 's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the the bathroom floors be on any given day 
um-hum yeah 
and then and then of course today it 's supposed to be all the other way 
you 're supposed to only want the job 
and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and and we have these wonderful people who are who are totally prepared to tea- to teach your child everything they need to know in day care and and uh we 'll see how the generations go 
yeah 
um-hum 
yeah 
but but but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you 're going to make at the job 
huh yeah 
i 
at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did 
yeah 
i 've i was an engineer with uh mechanical engineer with t i 
and uh i did it for six years 
and for one 
well i had one while i was pregnant 
and then one while my oldest was a year old 
and and it just drove me crazy 
did you 
i could not do either well enou- 
i could n't put in enough overtime that was necess- or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays as is you know as is needed and because my husband had had for a long time was out of the country also with uh with work for like three months 
um-hum 
oh yeah 
and 
so it was you and the kid 
and your work schedule is 
and yeah 
well that 's the thing see you know 
maybe if you get along 
for example if you 'd been a technician instead of an engineer 
you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they 're going to be there 
yeah 
it might have been better 
yeah 
but uh if you 're going to be more pro- professional oriented then you 've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job 
you 've got to have the flexibility that that does n't really go with the family 
yeah 
and so it was 
in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once 
um-hum 
so you figure one of these days you 're going to go back to being an engineer 
is that what 
well actually i 've found out that i 'm not going to go back to being an engineer 
you 
i 'm i 'm i 'm a photographer now 
think oh yeah oh okay 
you 've found something else 
i have i have branched out 
i was a photographer before 
but when i went to college it was i felt like i could n't support myself if i decided to be a photographer that it would just have to be a hobby 
um-hum yeah 
and i 'm i 'm very mechanical 
and mechanical engineering interested me 
so i did that 
and then i you know i did that for six years 
and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that i was that you know it was great 
yeah 
but i was bored part of the time too 
and i wanted something else to do 
yeah 
i mean you figure there 's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child 
yeah 
and it- it 's great while they 're really little 
but as they get older and they 're more independent and there 's things to do then it 's good for them to go to different 
um-hum 
i mean it he goes to a a mother 's day out program now once a week 
both of my kids do 
and so they 're getting they they get the socialization with other kids and y- you know and not really school but but a different authority than mom once in a while you know and kind of learning how to deal with society 
yeah um-hum yeah and and they they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides the same person every day 
yeah 
i think they do too 
and i need it for the break 
yeah 
well that 's the other thing you know 
they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work 
well still taking care of the children is a very important job 
so um-hum 
and and someone 's got to do it and be able to do it right 
and and if it 's not if it 's not mom then then dad or somebody 's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it 
and enjoy it 
that 's that 's the whole thing 
yeah 
yeah i think that 's the thing that were going to see 
well i think the biggest thing we 're going to see coming up in the next ten year- even in the even now they 're starting to do it but i think it 's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there 's going to be a lot of women 
and they 're going to have to work it out to working part time 
um-hum 
because if if i if i had been allowed to work you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out 
yeah 
because i liked my job really well 
um-hum 
but i was just pulled in so many different directions 
i was it was just driving me crazy 
and now with the photography that 's you know it 's working 
that 's what i 'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and and use those hours to do 
yeah 
the the thing that i 'm doing is taking school pictures in day cares and in mother 's day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that 
uh-huh 
yeah 
um-hum 
so my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week 
or my husband if it 's you know an- an- when he 's at home can take care of them 
yeah 
so jobs have to i guess become more flexible 
i think they 're really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well 
um-hum yeah 
it 's going to have to be both 
well so so that 's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the father 's attitudes about you know who- whose job is this 
yeah 
well it- it 's his job too 
and i 
to me the only important issue is the children 
because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women 
and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework does n't take as much time as it used to 
so uh 
you know it 's just convincing your husband that 's important or that that that it 's important enough for him to do it 
to 
m- 
yeah 
to 
yeah 
to 
m- yeah 
well 
because if he saw mom doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it 's hard to think of it in that other you know uh that i should do it or tha- or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it 
um-hum 
yeah 
and you you you 
yeah 
you talk 
yeah 
yeah 
i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done 
um-hum 
yeah 
this is what you do it now 
an- and a man might say out loud well you know i understand this 
and i agree 
but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and and that 's a very hard attitude to change 
no yes 
and 
yeah 
and without and and it 's just they do n't look at things 
most men do n't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it 
um-hum 
they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the on the sink and and put the next plate down and and in a while get around to it 
and i think most women walk in and and and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be do- this is the time this needs to be done 
hm 
uh 
um-hum yeah 
but 
and a lot of that is is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea you know someone 's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas to so that they know that uh you know male and female are both responsible for doing this and and uh 
that 's right yeah 
um-hum 
yeah 
um-hum 
and i think that 's that 's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls 
it 's not they 're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know 
uh-huh 
um-hum yeah yeah 
you both got to they were both working at whatever things were needed to be done 
they 're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it 's a woman 's job or a man 's job but because it 's dirty and it needs to be cleaned 
um-hum 
yeah 
um-hum yeah 
but i think in between we got a a group of kids a generation of kids who did n't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad did n't move in to fill the gap 
and so basically no one was taking the responsibility and i i think that 's happened in a lot of cases 
and it 's going to it 's going to 
yeah 
some kids are really having it 
if they 'd been in day care the entire time and it was n't 
yeah 
the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college 
yeah 
um-hum um you know some time day care is really good 
yeah 
but sometimes it 's just it 's baby sitting 
yeah 
it 's someone you know keeping an eye on the kids 
but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any relationship with the adults to say you know here 's what 's right 
yeah 
and here 's what 's wrong 
and and here 's what we expect of you 
yeah 
i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my kids to have my values 
and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little you know 
yeah 
this is the way i feel about this 
and this is the way because i it 's you know 
when you when you if you if you teach them when they 're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older 
um-hum 
but if no one does anything when they 're little then it 's twice as hard as i think as they get older 
yeah 
i 'm i 'm saying this as i 'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something 
yes 
i understand 
i i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls 
yeah 
well she 's usually in bed by this time 
but she 's staying up late tonight 
but 
yeah you know 
i want to i want to have a relationship with her 
you know m- my dad was a very traditional dad 
and when i was a child i did n't really know my dad very well 
and i miss that 
and i want 
yeah that 's the thing 
if woman 's role like we said if women 's roles change drastically men 's roles will too 
yeah 
the men have to be convinced of that 
and a lot of it 's for the better 
some of the some of the women 's roles i think are almost for the worse because we 're losing out on some things going back to work 
but i think if we can if we can expand the men 's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably did n't very often i know i know mine almost never did 
no 
and so i like the ibm pc personally 
but that 's pretty much everything i 've worked with 
and uh i 've become so accustomed to it that uh it 's li- second nature 
yeah 
what do you use 
well i have an i an ibm ps two model thirty 
yes 
and uh it 's kind of it 's getting kind of too slow for me 
but my job i 'm an edp auditor 
so i audit uh computer applications both on the pc and the mainframe level 
uh-huh oh uh-huh huh-uh 
and i just use my pc constantly 
not only do i do pc type things like uh using lotus or word processors 
uh-huh 
i also use my pc to emulate a mainframe terminal for our ibm mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine 
oh okay 
so all i have on my desk is my pc 
but i 'm i 'm getting not only our local area network 
but i 'm getting two separate mainframe machines also 
oh okay 
oh we um we use an it 's an ibm ps two also 
huh-uh 
and um you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than i 'd like uh but uh uh i we i do mainly um graphics on it and uh a little with word processing and then l- uh lotus applications to it 
huh-uh 
huh-uh 
yeah 
and uh uh you know i do n't know 
i just i enjoy working with them 
yeah 
there 's just there 's so many capabilities out there 
i mean the things you can do are endless 
yeah 
i 've become kind of the pc guru in our audit department because it 's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground 
uh-huh 
and there 's uh three of us edp auditors 
and one of the three of us has an accounting background 
and so she 's not real proficient in pcs 
and the other just has n't used pcs that much 
uh-huh 
so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they 're doing 
and i 'm the administrator for our local area network 
and i need to keep that going 
and so i i 'm i could n't live my life without a pc 
now i do n't have one at home 
we have one at home 
but i just do n't find the time that i can use it 
wh- wh- yeah 
i wou- right now i would rather not have one at home because i would work at home 
i yes 
um we 've got a couple of portable lap top pcs at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot to do work 
uh 
and if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night 
uh-huh oh th- one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave 
they did n't know how they were going to do without me at work because i am pretty much the uh like you said the guru in the office uh with the uh the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is 
yeah 
uh-huh 
and um uh so they did n't know how it was going to work 
they 're thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that uh in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so 
yeah 
but uh you know it 's uh they 're they 're really great uh it 's almost like we could we could become too dependent on them 
yeah 
and oh i the uh we use a lot of free lance 
uh-huh 
and uh that 's uh pretty much takes up a lot of our day as far as producing transparencies and things 
yeah 
and um it 
uh you know compared to what the uh the way the things have upgraded have uh really 
they 're what 's the word i 'm looking for 
i 'm just totally drawing a blank 
we just but uh the way things have have changed over the years with the pc and the different programs is just great 
it 's remarkable as far as the things that we can do now and compared to what we could do you know back a few years yeah 
yeah 
and it 's just not fast enough for me so i want to get a new uh four eighty six chip 
but i do n't know i do n't know if my boss will spring for it 
but i 'm i 'm i 'm i determined to brake mine 
so he has to get me another one 
yeah 
we 
well that 's what i do 
we had a printer a a hewlett packard ready writer 
think 
and we had about ten people sharing this printer 
by it was attached to like a central pc 
and you had to take your diskette to the pc to print something 
about that a lot uh-huh oh um now that 's awful 
so the first thing when i started work at this bank was i said well now first of all we need to all be able to share this pc without getting up 
so i talked my boss into investing in a it 's not a uh yeah a uh real elaborate local area network 
huh-uh 
but we can share the printer 
and we can uh send ma- uh files to each other 
uh-huh 
and we can mail send mail messages to each other which is what which is good enough 
oh okay 
it 's what we need 
um-hum right 
and then i talked them into buying a hp laser jet 
hm yes 
and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it 
but once he bought it he has been so pleased 
it 's it 's fast 
it 's quite 
oh it has good copy 
right 
the quality that you can put out off with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers 
yeah 
i 've i 've got a little little uh ibm pro printer on my desk 
yeah 
but and i can use either the pro printer 
or i 've got my pc configured to where i can use either printer the one that 's on the network or my own 
uh-huh 
so if i just need something real quick and i do n't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed 
i can just print it in my office 
um uh we 're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer 
yeah 
and uh it 's just so 
y- you know with budget restraints and things like that it 's makes it difficult 
and 
they have gotten really cheap 
hewlett packard makes it 's it 's actually a dot matrix printer but the quality is almost uh laser quality 
uh-huh 
oh uh-huh 
and i think it 's called the desk jet 
and they 're under i think they 're uh about eight hundred dollars now 
yeah and we uh got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred uh 
oh 
yeah 
i do n't remember what kind they were 
uh but uh we uh do a lot of transparencies 
huh-uh 
sometimes the color would take too long to pl- uh to plot out 
yeah 
so they just want black and white ones and see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it 
yeah 
yeah 
but uh it uh 
i mean that 's all you need for like for like bullet charts and stuff 
you do n't need them in four colors 
uh-huh no 
uh-huh 
if it was a customer presentation then that would be different 
yeah 
we would want to to razzle-dazzle uh 
but uh it 's uh 
yeah 
we we have one in the office 
and if we want to use it well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to had to change it uh put it on a disk and carry it over to there and see if they 're not using the the printer 
yeah use the sneaker net system 
right 
yeah 
and uh wait for an opportunity to use it 
yeah 
we used to have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the 
uh-huh 
until they got off the machine 
i know 
i 
understand 
that was 
uh i was amazed when i came to work 
i worked at the uh 
well it used to be the largest bank in san antonio until n c n b came in and bought up the rival 
and now n c n b 's got a little larger market share 
uh-huh 
but it 's the it 's the only uh 
well it 's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in texas 
it 's the only one that 's still alive 
oh uh-huh 
so any way i work in a in a big prestigious place 
right right 
and i could n't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here 's the audit department of this this huge holding company sharing a hp rugged writer 
i was going oh wait a minute 
come on guys 
this is crummy 
so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you 're behind you know the times in technology 
yeah 
yeah 
we 're we 're pushing real hard though 
we 're we 're trying 
well see the the entire bank is not like that 
we 
the the bank philosophy is one of innova- innovation and lead the market 
here 
it 's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior vice president over audits is cheap 
uh-huh 
and it 's real hard to pry money out of him to to t- do these things 
but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better 
and 
uh-huh right 
so 
we we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when uh we work for a computer company and uh how are we supposed to present the imagine that we 're supposed to present with equipment that 's outdated and when it 's obsolete 
yeah 
and the the guys that that some of the guys that run this place are very tight 
and it 's like well why do we need this 
can n't you do that with you know what we have 
and and when we try and then they complain about this does n't look good so um-hum 
yeah 
unfortunately the the uh computer equipment and and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly 
like for instance we bought a 
okay 
was i supposed to do something 
no 
i had to press one 
good 
uh let 's see 
so uh were we right in the middle east 
sure 
should we have been there 
uh-huh 
did we do what was correct there 
i think we should have stayed longer 
should we have fought them harder used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that were n't used 
uh i think what we did was good 
but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do 
oh you agree with schwartzkopf who says uh drive on into baghdad 
yeah 
i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in iraq out now because it 's kind of like a civil war going on now 
and it 's almost like they 're killing each other off 
and there is not going to be anything left of iraq at all 
would that be so bad 
was there anything there to begin with 
well i think i do n't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it um 
it was n't ours 
well no 
i just mean that the world in general 
well we 've got to talk 
so it 's just just as well we argue 
yeah 
um i do n't know 
i think we should have helped the the innocent people in iraq out a little bit more than rather than just quitting where we did 
i agree 
would n't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country 
yes 
but i think that 's almost impossible next to impossible 
yeah 
so other political things that 's going on 
i heard mister bush say uh excuse me president bush say that he uh wanted to improve the highways 
oh see i have n't really been keeping up with them 
so i really do n't know what he said 
what did he say about it 
oh he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country 
uh-huh 
we do n't have the money for that 
but would n't it be wonderful 
it would be really nice because i 'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes 
and back east you all drive at fifty five do n't you 
what 's that 
i 'm sorry i dropped the phone 
oh okay um 
i say back east you all drive at fifty five do n't you 
yeah 
see out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fifty five we drive sixty five 
uh-huh 
oh really 
oh yes 
well i uh last weekend went home to visit my parents 
my dad 's in the hospital 
oh well you guys you you have more flats do n't you it 's flatter out there uh-huh 
and uh between here and west texas there was probably three and four hours at sixty five miles an hour 
oh i did n't realize that 
nonstop 
have you have you ever been out here 
no 
huh-uh 
how far west have you been 
only in ohio 
oh you 've never you 've never seen the great american desert 
i 've never been past ohio 
no 
huh-uh 
i 've never seen anything out i never seen the great 
i 've seen 
the rocky mountains 
i 've never seen 
i 've seen pictures of it 
but i 've never been there 
yellowstone 
i 've seen pictures 
i just i 'm a college student 
and um i 'm paying for my own education 
and i 'm i come from a large family 
and we we we 're never able to take vacations because there 's there 's twelve kids in my family 
uh well my college educa- uh 
so 
thirty six 
worked for texas instruments for seventeen or eighteen now 
oh my 
uh know virtually nothing else 
uh-huh 
uh yeah 
i got my four year got my bs in general science 
really 
yeah 
i know 
it 's a funny degree 
uh anyway uh i know nothing other than the west 
yeah 
in fact uh down in east texas where the company 's located there 's streams and water and things i do n't understand trees and have the gulf 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and it 's really interesting 
uh-huh 
so tell me about where you live 
well um i 'm i 'm originally from butler 
and that 's about an hour away from where i am now 
i 'm at clairon 
and um it 's it 's pretty like windy and hilly 
uh how high is the highest elevation 
oh i could n't even tell you 
like uh probably three thousand foot 
it 's not like a mountain 
it would n't be like a mountain 
it 's uh 
oh i do n't even know 
i have no clue 
close to sea level 
i would say it 's closer to sea level 
okay uh 
right here in colorado springs where i live it 's over six thousand foot 
uh-huh 
oh well see um 
um yes 
when i lived in texas every year i had to drive you know 
i drove every year to the gulf 
and you know so i could have a feast of fresh seafood six eight twelve hours away 
uh-huh 
um 
you know just just for fresh 
i i 'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of america 
uh-huh 
how many hours have you been from home 
uh the farthest away from home 
yes 
probab- 
i 'd say five or six 
oh yeah 
uh-huh 
uh now when i was growing up in the panhandle of texas 
look at your map later and see the the town of amarillo fifty miles north of that up in the panhandle 
uh-huh 
to just go buy a pair of jeans we 'd drive an hour 
oh my 
oh my gosh 
when i was growing up 
uh-huh 
now things are different 
and people buy jeans in town 
but uh we thought nothing at all of wake up waking up in the morning hop in you know the car grabbing fishing poles and driving four hours 
oh yes 
now see for me that 's a long ways 
yeah 
it is i imagine 
uh-huh 
even well like i i 'm in like a little town right now 
it 's smaller than butler 
and um butler butler is about an hour north east of pittsburgh 
so that will give you some idea of where i 'm at 
okay 
and i 'm about i 'm about two hours north east of pittsburgh 
okay 
i 'll look at my map later 
wow 
how neat 
and uh i mean just this this little town here here is basically a college town 
the college without the college here this town would be nothing 
it would be absolutely dead 
because it 's completely made up of fast food restaurants 
and and in the summer when we co- uh 
my fiancee 's family lives up here 
we come up here in the summer 
and it 's 
i mean there 's just no one around 
so are you working your way through college 
um well i go home in the summer 
and i work in the summer 
and between what i make in the summer and student loans that 's how i go to college 
well how neat 
what 's your major 
finance 
finance 
uh-huh 
well that 's interesting 
uh-huh 
so uh what do you plan to do with it 
um well like i said my fiancee 
savings and loans uh 
no 
no 
no 
no 
um my fiancee works down in d c 
and i 'd actually like to work for a company rath- rather than a bank or a something 
i 'd rather work for a company and um like be their financial advisor or something 
oh that would be great 
that would be neat 
let 's see uh 
so we 're all excited in colorado springs 
uh-huh 
apple computer is coming to town 
oh really 
yes 
the uh new employer in in the city 
uh-huh 
so we 're expecting our local economy to uh maybe not boom but uh at least recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still 
take a boom a little bit 
well well what would be the unemployment rate out there 
uh unemployment runs approximately six percent 
see that 's what it is here too 
but now under employment i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent 
uh-huh 
and the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree 
yeah 
it 's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs 
yes 
it is 
i know people that have been out of school for two or three years 
and they have a job that has nothing to do 
now 
i 'm sorry 
there you go 
okay 
excuse me 
and uh i do that 
we recycle uh newspapers 
we take you know the dallas morning news daily and the plano paper daily 
right 
and you know after a month of that you got a ton of newspapers 
oh i know it builds up really fast 
it really does 
yeah 
i do recycle newspapers and uh glass 
yeah 
uh-huh 
we do n't really have enough plastic to mess with 
we do n't you know like we do n't drink milk 
and we do n't have children 
so we do n't have you know six thousand plastic milk jugs a month you know 
yeah 
we do 
we have two a two year old and a three year old 
yeah 
and so it really builds up with us 
right 
but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place 
just put them in a different uh container 
yeah 
and uh plano has plans 
i believe it 's tentatively scheduled for sometime in may of this year 
the city is going to leave uh receptacles at people 's home 
oh yeah 
and they ca- 
that would be much more convenient 
it 
yeah 
certainly would 
and they can separate it 
and then the you know trash guys will pick it up which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or people who can n't or do n't drive you know 
yeah 
yeah 
or it just builds up so often 
they can n't get to the these centers 
yeah 
and i 'm sure rather than try to uh ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them you know 
yeah 
yeah 
but i think that 's probably a good idea 
they used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all 
uh-huh 
and they stopped doing it because they said it was n't profitable 
right 
so finally um they the people put so much pressure on the city 
uh-huh 
they did a survey of everybody 
uh-huh 
and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic um and put it in front of the wal-mart store in town 
uh-huh 
and th- they 
it just really 
e- e- every time you went by there it was just over flowing 
that 's right 
and so wal-mart complained 
uh-huh 
yes 
so they moved it behind the store 
and nobody knew where it was 
yeah 
and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be 
great 
oh it was just like a dump there 
i bet it was 
and so finally you know i called 
and the- they said you know it was behind there 
and i started taking my things behind there 
uh-huh 
so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper 
uh-huh 
sure 
but it just builds up 
uh-huh 
it would be so nice if they had it you know at your home where you could just turn it in 
uh-huh 
so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area in one neighborhood 
right 
and they have pickup there 
it 's uh i think once or twice a week 
uh-huh 
and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out 
so they had not much participation 
and they were going to cancel it 
but then finally people started getting the message 
yeah 
it 's just a matter of education i think 
yeah 
and i think that you know if they can get enough going they 'll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city 
uh-huh 
but it 's not 
i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this 
uh-huh 
and it 's not going to be 
yeah 
i do n't think 
yeah 
that 's right 
yeah 
i think basically it 's a good idea you know 
i hope it works 
yeah 
i do to because it 's amazing how much you know trash we can generate 
absolutely 
absolutely 
i know this year we took our christmas tree 
they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded 
right 
and they gave you a little um seedling to plant you know 
uh-huh 
right 
you could take the the mulch home with you you know and take buckets of that home 
uh-huh 
so that was really good idea 
sure 
i thought 
absolutely 
and there 's just you know the two of us my wife and i 
and it 's amazing how much stuff j- just the two of us generate 
yeah 
you know i can imagine a family of you know four or five 
oh yeah 
it 's really 
it adds up so fast 
it really does 
yeah 
as far as new stuff to recycle you know i do n't really i do n't really know 
i really had n't thought about it to tell you the truth 
yeah 
well they 're working on diapers which would be great 
that 's right 
i was 
uh-huh 
i 've read so many different things about diapers 
and now their saying that uh originally they thought the disposables were just awful 
uh-huh 
but now their saying that they 're there really not that much in comparison to the others because you do n't have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too 
that 's right 
so the the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off 
uh-huh 
yeah 
so i do n't know what 's the you know right thing to do 
but i really would hope that they would come up 
i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable 
uh-huh 
but the landfill have to do something special you know for those 
i see 
but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too 
so 
oh i 'm sure it must 
yes you know 
i 'm not personally involved because i do n't you know i do n't have any children that wear diapers 
yeah 
but i 'm sure it creates a large amount of you know uh refuse 
yeah it does 
and you just feel guilty if you do n't do something with them you know because you hate to contribute to the problem 
that 's right 
that 's right 
absolutely 
but on the on the other hand the alternatives are n't to great either 
that 's right 
absolutely 
absolutely 
yeah 
i do n't know what else they could recycle more of 
i guess we do n't really use that many tin cans 
i guess there 's some places where you can recycle aluminum 
but i do n't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in 
uh-huh 
i do n't know if those are recyclable 
or 
i think they 're made out of aluminum 
um 
yes 
there are there is a receptacle you know at the centers also for aluminum 
yeah 
but again we do n't we do n't generate that much 
so 
yeah 
we do n't 
we do n't either 
yeah 
we usually use frozen vegetables and things 
so we do n't really have much of that 
that 's right 
that 
ninety nine percent of ours is newspaper and uh you know uh glass 
but yeah 
well now when we lived out in california they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car or for aerosol cans and things like that because they say it 's not safe to put those things in the regular trash 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
car batteries 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i do n't you know i do n't change my own oil 
so i do n't i do n't uh do n't have that problem 
yeah 
well other than that i 'm not really sure 
yeah 
we we try to recycle old clothes 
uh-huh 
yeah 
well we do to as a matter of fact 
our church has a place where you can take them 
right 
and they you know pass them on to other families 
yeah 
so 
yes 
we have one of those in town 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yeah 
you know our church each year has a 
one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale 
oh 
and there 's a ton of clothes always you know left over 
and i take those down to the uh 
it 's called the clothes closet 
uh-huh 
that 's what it 's called here in plano 
kind of like a goodwill kind of place 
right 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and they distribute them to the people that need them 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's that 's real helpful too 
uh-huh 
yeah 
well i 'm not sure of any- i can n't really think of anything else that we could recycle 
no 
i can n't either 
yeah 
i really can n't um 
no 
i i really can n't either 
okay 
okay 
well it was nice talking to you 
you to 
take 
-kay 
care 
uh-huh 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
so uh tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago 
well let 's see 
well we assume i was an adult twenty years ago 
um 
well you 're you 're able to you 're able to uh vote and go to war and things like that 
so 
uh yeah 
definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote 
oh that 's right 
that 's one of the changes 
not vote 
that was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years 
um yeah 
twenty years ago was nineteen seventy uh 
nineteen seventy i had been married two years 
uh-huh 
um we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty eight 
uh-huh 
and uh around here on the uh east coast uh we were heavy into affirmative action 
yes 
and uh that was a uh a great shock for a lot of people and uh a great disappointment for some people like myself 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
um i was gainfully employed by safeway stores incorporated and uh trying desperately to uh get ahead with the company 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh the problem was that my hair was too long 
uh-huh 
and uh that you were n't allowed to have a uh mustache or a beard 
and uh you know jeans just flat out were n't allowed unless you worked on night stock 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and if you wanted to get ahead with the company 
uh-huh 
well if you were a uh black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months 
if you were white male you 're talking six years 
huh 
and that 's basically where i ended up 
i uh i just flat out could n't get a hold you know get ahead with the company because they were dead in affirmative action 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
um on other fronts um 
and is the company now uh well represented uh demographically at the higher echelons 
um 
did it work 
i think so 
i- i i i stopped working for them in uh seventy eight seventy nine 
uh-huh 
and uh it 's 
i think they 're they 're like all companies well represented 
um-hum 
and uh you know everything seems to be fine 
um-hum 
i i 've kind of lost touch with the company 
we had a falling out 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but uh as far as uh as their management goes um i 'm not sure they 're any any better off than they were were before management wise 
uh-huh 
but uh other changes um 
just people seem to be more outspoken now individually rather than collectively 
uh-huh 
um back in the seventies we had uh a lot of uh protests against the war and uh bring our troops home 
and things were more organized 
uh-huh 
and uh i 've noticed that now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
um 
so there 's less you think now there 's less of a a social movement and more individual m- lots of individual movements 
yeah 
in a sense 
i 'm not sure if that was because you know eighties was like the uh the me decade 
the me decade 
uh-huh 
and uh everybody was into me 
and then we are getting back into us 
but um it it it 's 
i 've seen uh uh a great deal of change as far as um corporate responsibility and things um 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and people 's response to that you know at first not trusting and now expecting more 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and what ab- what about the last ten years that you 've been aware 
well that i 've been aware of i 've 
at least in my own circles i 've been aware of an increasing from my generation 
i do n't know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you 
but half generation off i guess 
um i 've noticed uh a certain increase um pessimism with america no longer being sort of on top 
i had the impression 
well i mean there was the quote unquote losing of the vietnam war which was a blow 
and it was right around that time when i started becoming socially you know a socially conscious adult 
and i realize that people of my age have no um no major success in the sense that uh you saw the passage of the civil rights act and um major social change in that sense 
and i and all the changes that have happened in the last uh even during my adulthood have been more incremental 
they 've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made 
but there has n't been the same sort of fiery speeches of martin luther king or whatever that has really uh galvanized the population 
and there 's just 
instead there 's been sort of an increasing oh i do n't know japan bashing and things like that 
uh-huh 
and uh a lot of 
i see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are you know maybe twenty a real sense of you know america 's losing it and losing it in the competitive market and a real knowl- uh a lack of understanding how that could be and in the sense that how could america have gone from being number one to possibly being number two to you know our former enemies and things like that 
yes 
and um so i see i see a lot of uh a lot of pessimism growing um 
and at the same time i think there 's there 's there 's a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate respons- increased corporate responsible towards uh you know environmental safety and things like that 
and that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the civil rights act in in the near future in terms of you know some real landmark bills passing and things like that such that you know people 
cause thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now 
i mean my generation does n't can n't rest on the the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that you know yes there 's still some racism 
but you know basically things are the assumption things are basically kind of taken care of 
and there 's a notion of fairness 
yes 
that um while still far from perfect is much more established i think 
but even uh i think uh along the line of the uh goals of civil rights um there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone 
uh-huh 
oh of course 
i mean you know 
it 's human nature 
you know do n't like the way you look do n't like the way you dress do n't like your hair do n't you know 
it 's just something that always sets people off 
you know you either like someone 
or you do n't like someone 
or you 're just completely indifferent 
yeah 
yeah 
and the problem is that ideally you they you know the world would like you to be completely indifferent 
so um but i- i i understand what you say about the environmental movement um 
it 's it 's been a long time coming um 
being a uh a very old hippie 
uh-huh 
yes 
um i mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie 
and you keep that image your whole life 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yeah 
no matter what you do 
and i- i just i 've seen a lot of changes i mean from the original earth day and um i 'm heavily involved in you know my own personal recycling 
uh-huh 
we recycle paper and cans here at work 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and you know i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and you know all that stuff at home 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and i 'm starting to see more and more recycling centers cropping up all over the place here on the east coast 
uh-huh 
right 
and that 's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else 
yeah 
like 
i mean all this recycling used to be in tact or not all of it 
yeah 
but much of it did 
i mean recycling was a was a wartime thing 
and then they turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war 
yes 
yes 
and now we got to the point where the junkyards you 've got to pay them to take something there 
uh-huh 
so things have really changed a lot 
i think the uh the other part about uh america 's decline i think has to do with yeah the perceived decline has to do with uh um the attitudes and the educational system uh 
a perceived decline anyway 
yeah 
i have children in in s- i have three children in school right now 
and i 'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them 
uh i had when i was down in dallas for two years i had uh my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong and words spelled wrong not marked as such 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and this person 's teaching my children 
uh-huh 
you know i had a real problem with that 
yeah 
well i 'd i 'd say actually i mean as someone who 's involved in education i 'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society 
i mean relative pay which is a major way we value people has been poorer and poorer over the years 
uh you know that there 's been cost of living increases 
but not quite in proportion to cost of living 
and you know it 's just more and more uh a real low income sort of job and very low prestige 
i mean there 's that that old saying those who can do it and those who can n't teach 
this is the way of let 's make fun of the teachers 
those are the people who can n't do anything 
yeah 
and if you have that kind of social attitude it 's hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education 
yeah 
and you get more and more people who would just end up there because it 's uh it 's the safety net of those of you know average intelligence or something 
they can always teach 
um i 'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in maryland 
but they 're trying to get a uh a uh a merit system here in maryland rather than a uh tenure system for all the you know elementary middle school and high schools so that the teach 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
well this is kind of ironic because i work in ti 's legal department 
do you 
and although we do n't have any criminal actions here we do have other um lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time 
uh-huh 
and uh when was it 
a couple weeks ago i was asked to go to uh jury duty 
i i was n't selected 
but um for some of our cases in particular we have um uh very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such 
sure 
and it 's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we 're talking about 
well i do think that the cases like the uh oh say something like texaco versus pennzoil 
uh-huh 
or or the texaco pennzoil problem uh is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand and really should have some better way where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved should handle cases like that 
uh-huh 
right 
yeah 
you know some instances i do n't 
you always have the option 
now in criminal i guess you always have a jury 
but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not 
oh is that right 
yeah 
and in some incidences i think they ought to ought not to have a jury 
yeah 
um 
oh 
boy 
or uh or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury 
uh i was only on one jury ever so far in my life 
uh-huh 
and uh it really was a pretty trivial case 
and it seemed to me all the time i was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over this case that involved oh a couple thousand dollars i think it was it was really just uh uh terrific waste of everybody 's time and money 
uh-huh 
um 
and it finally ended up that uh even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it they settled the case 
oh 
they wou- they had settled while we were deliberating 
yeah 
now the one thing i did approve of there was that we did n't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case 
uh-huh 
and uh we were split uh ten to two 
so it was uh a good thing that it was n't a total waste of time to have a hung jury on a case that trivial 
yeah 
well um i 've never fully served 
i mean i 've been asked twice to go down 
but i did n't get elected on the panel 
but i know that um for a lot of the civil cases it 's rare 
i mean if your a lawyer um there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom 
there 's a lot of attorneys like that that never get to the courtroom 
some their kind of law does n't get them to the courtroom 
but even in um litigation which is doing lawsuits is a lot of times that you never get to the courtroom itself 
and yeah 
uh-huh well i think that the trial in a sense is kind of a threat to hold over people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court because it does cost so much money 
but it 's a shame that oh 
it 's not so bad for the court system because the money there is n't being spent 
but there 's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get scared enough by going to the court 
and usually it 's the s- it 's the scare kind of of the jury because you really do n't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel 
uh-huh 
you could feel that you really have a very strong case and that you 're very much right 
but the jury may or may not see it that way 
sure 
so you get a little antic- you know anxious there and go well you know i do n't feel that sure 
yeah 
and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you go gee 
yeah 
i was a witness in a case in a criminal case 
uh-huh 
and it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded 
um oh really 
and that the jury was never allowed to hear 
and they convicted the defendant ah on as far as i could tell very flimsy evidence and two perjured testimonies 
and i knew the people involved both the people who perjured and the people who uh were defendants 
uh-huh 
and 
yeah 
i think that was just a a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the uh you know staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury that uh were highly relevant to the case and could i thought have established the defendant 's innocence 
yeah 
so uh i do 
although i 'm a lawyer 's daughter and i have lawyer 's and judges on both sides of the family and uncles and cousins and things like that i really think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice 
oh is 
that right yeah 
and it seems a lot of times that uh especially in criminals that that their rights are so protected 
but what about the rights of you know the rest of society 
i mean we 're protecting this person 's rights who has broken the law um 
uh-huh 
and we protect him so much 
but what about the rest of the society 
you know what are we doing for them 
we 're kind of you know forgetting about them 
and i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of 
if he breaks law especially it he 's a repeater the law should n't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken 
well and then in a lot of 
yeah 
in criminal cases uh for instance you can n't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case 
and it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime 
yeah 
yeah and now it 's possible that he did n't commit this one 
but the likelihood is certainly tilted 
yeah 
with a record like that 
and uh that was one of the things that we 're not allowed to was not allowed in the uh trial i went to 
yeah 
though uh one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony had a long criminal record and had been you know a real sleaze bag 
um jeez 
and he came in and was presented to the court as a fine upstanding young man who had uh been in seminary to become a priest 
and yeah you would have thought the guy was just pure as the driven snow 
but i happen to know his background 
and i know that he would have sold out his mother for uh uh shorter sentence 
and you know it 's it 's really annoying when the 
i asked the defense attorney later why he did n't bring up all this other trouble the guy had been in 
he said that that was barred uh by the court 
um 
so we do have some problems 
and it seems to me that uh maybe it 's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles 
and start over and then make a legal system that carefully protects people 
but uh where 
yeah 
i 'd even go for for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable uh um lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they 're lying or telling the truth 
yeah 
yeah 
that would be helpful 
yeah you know 
sure would 
yeah 
i witnessed one trial many years ago when i was first um studying to be a paralegal 
and uh uh they barred priors on this uh person 
and they never then told us i guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other 
um 
and they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other 
and the crime was uh uh attempt to commit murder you know 
um 
and but they never told us why these people were mad at each other 
and gee you know 
that 's 
and you think that would be relevant 
yeah 
you know because they they told us in school that you know crime has to be an intent you know has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it 
because there could be accidental kind of things you know 
right 
but they never told us why these two people hated their themselves or if one had done something to you know really aggravate the other 
there was never any motive given 
uh-huh 
and and i had a tough time with that 
and and being a person who saw what the jury did n't plus what the jury did because we were just observing you know there in the courtroom at the end of it all i still did n't know 
uh-huh 
yeah 
right 
i still have a lot of reasonable doubts 
and i 've seen everything presented 
and you know they just have n't done a real complete case here to my thinking 
uh-huh 
i do n't know that i want to sit on a jury like that 
i think so 
and uh 
and you 'd still you know 
i want ask some questions here 
and yeah 
that 's something i thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen 
uh-huh 
and it seems to me that you 'd get a lot more uh information if your questions were heard if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things or if or the lawyers things or even the judge 
uh-huh 
right 
but particularly the witnesses 
right 
yeah 
allow them to uh go back and and deliberate and uh you know after uh each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day bring those people back 
or if they would allow them to uh give broader answers they 
it 's really kind of uh choreographed 
it 's like a script has been written when people testify 
they are n't testifying really in their own words 
right 
yeah 
i can remember uh friends of daddy 
okay 
do you want to go first 
well i could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as as what was the topic 
fitness and exercise 
oh god 
no 
why do n't you go first 
okay 
um i like to do uh weight training and and cycling and just walking uh and swimming 
i- i used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until i had some knee surgery last fall 
and the doctor said that running and jumping is n't real good for my knee anymore 
so i had to kind of change my lifestyle a little bit 
hm well let me ask a personal question 
how old are you 
oh well then you you 
get the over thirty five everything goes downhill flop 
thirty eight 
uh well the the rest of me is in pretty good shape 
it 's just that left knee that just does n't want to do everything it used to 
oh well you 're lucky then 
because i 've battled arthritis all my life 
really 
i mean even since i was like about two or three 
ooh 
that 's when they diagnosed it 
and usually most people are just absolutely crippled 
and uh i do water aerobics religiously do water aerobics 
oh i bet that helps 
um-hum 
i used to do about six times a week 
and now i 'm down to about four 
but it 's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in sh- in in there 
uh i tried weight training 
and i 'm telling you you just i just can n't lift the things 
yeah 
and the shock on the system is is just too much 
so i have stuck to water aerobics basically you know the weightless thing and trying to keep in shape that way 
yeah 
but you know it 's hard to find 
i mean it 's really hard to find a place that 's going to offer water aerobics because what i 'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are 
i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way to get in shape without having to spend anything 
that 's right 
that 's right 
or it 's the geriatric crowd 
that 's right 
so i 've considered even becoming licensed to teach it 
well i mean if if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself 
and you probably do 
yeah 
but you have to have an indoor pool 
this is true 
so to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without you know drawing a lot of looks means you 're really going to do a strenuous workout activity 
you look very odd in the water 
well now 
and that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training 
and that does look very odd in the water 
at i can believe that 
have you tried the uh the pool at the spring creek fitness center 
no 
and you know that 's about the only place i have n't tried 
and people have told me 
now that 's the texan facility 
yes 
i have been told that thing is just lovely 
it is 
they keep it at eighty one degrees year-round 
huh 
ha- 
now do you use that facility a lot 
um a fair a fairly a fairly good amount uh more on the weekends 
uh i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings i try to come down to the dallas fitness center 
hum 
do you know if they have child care there 
um have you done your attitude survey for this year yet 
you need to put that on there seriously 
they do n't 
i do n't i do n't work at ti 
oh you do n't 
no 
i used to work at ti 
oh 
as matter of fact i was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position 
actually when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry 
and i used to fill out those attitude surveys 
yeah 
and uh uh me and the uh insurance ad- adjusters are are very familiar with each other 
and my husband still works there 
yeah 
and uh i get my attitude expressed through them 
but i find it to be very 
sometimes it 's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short sided mentality to save a few bucks 
this is true 
uh and never having lived in texas before i started to work for ti 
and i came down here 
and you know they did an attitude survey like six weeks after i had been working here 
and i asked about you know day care for the shift workers 
yeah 
and boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just do n't say that you know 
well it 's not 
and it 's not applicable to me 
and i was kind of horrified 
a now what year are we talking about 
we 're talking nineteen seventy eight 
okay 
uh things have become much more enlightened since then 
they could n't have gotten anymore in the dark ages 
yeah 
you know we still do n't have day care facility 
but people are more sympathetic to it 
i understand i understand that they 're now covering women 's preventative health care 
yes 
yes 
and uh the reason i 'm at home is when i had my kids and i was uh scheduled to go back and i tell you how much in the dark ages it was um i had been rated number one in the field 
and then i took uh 
when i became pregnant i also got meningitis and then delivered the first baby three months early 
ooh 
my gosh 
and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home 
and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment 
could you hold the phone for one second 
sure 
thanks 
okay 
i 'm back 
and then they used to uh 
and then i had a second one eighteen months later 
they told me to put them back to back 
and of course to maintain 
and i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one because that 's when i go into labor that 's like four and a half months 
wow 
and i do n't even know it 
of course it 's real easy to take care of the first one when you 're on your back 
oh yeah 
very easy 
ah very easy 
and they they put me on twenty four hour fetal monitoring then to to you know to to try to control the labor and see how far it was going 
and after the baby was born since it was n't premature then they said they would n't cover the cost of the monitor 
i think that 's kind of when my husband hit the roof because it was a uh thirteen thousand dollar bill 
really 
but after the second baby was born i was going to go back to work 
yeah 
and that was when they had 
god it would have been the eighty five layoff 
yeah 
and i 'll tell you how they handled this 
and i was just outraged 
i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been uh terminated until i filed my insurance claims about four months later 
and they did n't have any coverage under my name 
and i went back 
and i said what the hell is going on here you know 
yeah 
really 
and they told me that uh oh well you know you know your husband works here 
and he 's got a good salary 
we did n't think that you 'd be coming back anyway 
and uh you know we 've got people here that really you know need to be working 
and so that we had just 
you know it was this way we did n't have to layoff an active person 
and we 'd just let you go 
and it took me about a year of arguing 
i said you know you 've got to put this in writing to me and because until they put it in writing i could n't get my insurance benefits 
yeah 
and i could n't get my uh termination benefits either 
there you go 
i was just pissed as hell that they could do that 
i- i can believe that 
but i- i guess things have gotten better 
i 've been told that there 's flex hour and those kind of things 
oh yeah 
flex time is great 
i still do n't think that they after my experiences that they could you know get me to go back ever again 
i- i can understand 
i can understand 
well it 's been good talking with you 
but let me ask you this since you use texans 
how much is it a month 
yeah oh shoot it 's only about ten bucks a month 
now is that for an individual 
yeah 
i mean uh to add dependents is is you know maybe another dollar or something 
it 's no big deal 
that 's it 
yeah 
now are if you if you if you pay your your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes you 're taking 
uh you do for classes for classes 
but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge 
god that 's cheap 
yeah 
it is 
that 's really cheap 
do you have to be an active ti employee to join texans or or the dependent 
well or or a depe- 
or a dependent of one 
on god i am so dependent these days 
really 
it 's offensive to 
me alrighty well i i 'm seeing that my my codependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence 
wonderful 
yeah 
so my uh position from management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment 
but boy i think i 'm going to go contact texans 
i really think i am 
yeah 
i mean that beats any offer i 've heard in a long time 
oh yeah 
it 's great 
huh 
alrighty 
when you 're there on weekends is it crowded as hell 
uh well it would depend on when you go 
it 's not it 's not excessively crowded on the weekends 
see i 'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty 
oh i do n't think that would be bad at all 
if you 're in richardson you 'd probably wanted to come to the to the dallas site 
oh i i 'm actually right on the plano line 
oh well then you could go ei- either one 
yeah 
the spring creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more niceties amenities 
and you 'd probably like the pool there 
oh god it sounds like i would 
i might do that then 
okay 
i learned something here 
well i 'm good 
i 'm glad 
you can go back to work now 
well thank you 
thank you 
you have a good day 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
well in the normal i- in the normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first 
alrighty 
um well i uh h- have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year 
so i 'm really just starting to get involved in uh in what 's out there and how they do things 
um a- as far as the system as a whole i really do n't see a a problem with it 
i do see a problem with graduating people that that can n't read and are not you know productive in society or productive to themselves 
and uh i think that 's the main problem at this point 
how about yourself 
all right 
i 'm uh live in plano texas 
and uh um uh today we 're not even suppose to be in school because the uh the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally is n't any funding for the school systems in texas today 
uh-huh 
right 
so uh i mean when you when you take uh uh professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education 
and they can n't get their finger out of their ear long enough to to get that major subject in line 
something 's wrong 
so i think here in texas mainly that the the they 're not serious 
they 're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what how the level of education should be for children 
i have a one year old 
so i 'm not i 'm more opinionated about the observations than than the than the true facts 
but uh it 's just a shame to me tha- that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well-being 
uh-huh 
that 's true 
i have a i have a a real issue with that 
um i think that if from every year when they when they pull in the the the the uh test that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve year uh graders take 
and and and you see that their their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states 
then that 's saying that something 's wrong with the educational system here in texas 
and i have a real concern with about that um 
um matter of fact i 'm very content to send my daughter ou- out of state to college in in virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything 
uh-huh 
and then uh so i 'm my my opinion 
i thi- i think there 's a big concern 
uh hope- hopefully the new uh education secretary of education will do something to fix the problem 
but uh i do n't know 
they got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product 
yeah 
i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up and uh and not really get down to teaching what 's important 
um-hum 
teaching these kids you know how really the basics is what it comes down to 
exactly 
i- i was astonished to find out that that across the united states in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed 
is that right 
ha- they do n't even a lot of the school systems do n't even uh the kids nowadays do n't even know what what the president 's uh fitness education program 's all about 
huh 
they do n't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school 
i remember 
and yeah 
and uh i 'll i talked to a thirteen year old last night who 's uh goes to uh one of the plano s- high schools or or junior highs i guess 
and she said that that she had a a choice 
she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting 
so she chose to take weight lifting over the regular gym 
i mean give me a break 
i mean th- th- the kids sit there 
and they dr- and they drink cokes and eat popcorn for for for l- for lunch 
and then go out there and lift weights and do n't learn anything 
and talk 
yeah 
it 's just a real i have a real problem with the whole system 
huh 
they need to put some sternness back into the into the teachers and let them be able to uh get the old whip out and get some discipline 
yeah 
then it comes down to what you said before though about them being uh some of the lowest paid public you know public service employees that there are 
um-hum 
i used to i used to date a girl who taught english at ninth grade level 
and yet they 're so important 
uh-huh 
i mean i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she they wou- that she was paid 
true 
she was young you know 
but still it 's the principle 
right 
of course if she got her master 's degree it 'd all be different 
but uh 
well you know it 's hard though because then you start talking taxes 
and uh that 's bad word 
oh taxes lord forbi- f- lord forbid taxes 
goodness gracious if we would uh plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads we 'd cut that in half and give to the teachers we might have such a problem 
there 's an idea 
maybe i should run for office huh 
run on that then no income taxes in texas huh 
this is true 
i 'm in texas too 
so 
that 's funny 
that 's funny 
well that 's about all i have here 
well gee well me too 
i uh i think we both agree there 's some problems there 
but we 'll s- maybe do our small part to fix them up 
yes 
maam 
surely 
i 've enjoyed it 
all right 
you too 
bye bye 
bye 
well patricia i was just about to get on my tread mill 
and then i remembered that i did n't make a call last night 
and i thought i 'd make one tonight 
well i have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom 
but it usually 's holding clothes 
that 's what i did with mine for a long time put it on the handlebars so i can hang them up 
right 
and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat 
well that 's not why i got it right 
how do you like your tread mill 
uh-huh i like it 
you do n't get 
is it less boring than the bicycle or not 
no 
it 's just as boring 
you watch tv or something while you do it 
i read a book while i 'm doing it 
oh 
but i was doing that on the exercise bike 
yeah i do that too 
i feel like i 'm getting a little better of a workout and i 'm losing more weight on this than i had on the other 
really 
are you 
and my legs you know 
how 
okay 
i 'm going to turn forty this summer 
i was getting all dimpled up 
a yeah 
and those are going away 
really 
so that 's real good 
uh 
we got it at a little bit of an incline 
are n't they k- are they kind of expensive 
uh this one yeah this is five hundred 
ooh 
i know they get cheaper 
oh do 
but i do n't know uh-huh 
they probably the more you pay though the better the machine you have 
well i hope so 
well you ought to believe that anyway right 
yeah 
i did n't buy it really 
my husband bought it because we we 'd we 'd never get out and go walking or anything 
and we go to the lake 
and we ski and swim in the summer 
but besides that 
during the year 
uh-huh 
well yeah 
well in bad weather you know well you 'd have to do something inside 
yeah 
do you work at ti not 
uh-huh 
i think your voice sounds familiar 
really 
where do you wo- 
i live in arlington 
i wonder if we talked before 
where do you live 
i 'm in garland 
no uh 
well 
you sound like this girl that i talked to about books 
and we got into movies one night 
oh really 
uh-huh 
uh no 
this is the first time i 've done it 
uh my husband was just running out the door 
he 's working at night tonight 
so i decided to do it 
i have n't talked before 
uh what subjects have you talked about 
let 's see 
education 
uh social changes that we 've seen in the last ten twenty thirty years 
well that 's interesting 
yeah 
that one was 
it 's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle right 
the most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner 
oh my goodness 
the other woman did n't cook too much either 
right 
they really have a lot of variety 
yeah 
they do 
i talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in ohio one night about education 
oh 
and she was 
a a school administrator 
uh-huh 
well that could that would have been interesting 
she retired but 
yeah 
and then one night i talked to these two guys no one night i talked to one guy 
and then a couple of weeks later i talked to the guy 's roommate in virginia about different things 
really 
well that 's neat 
yeah uh-huh 
one was about painting 
when was the last time you painted something 
did you feel like you did a good job 
did you feel uh rewarded while you were doing it 
um hm 
how long is this going to go on do you know 
i do n't know 
i do n't either 
it 's interesting though 
i never heard of such a project before 
i 
do n't know hum-um well how 'd you find out about it 
pardon me 
how did you find out about it 
oh i do n't know 
i guess my husband got a letter at the office i i presume 
and they must have been asking 
does your husband work with ti 
uh-huh 
oh really 
uh-huh 
i have a friend that had a roommate that worked at ti 
uh-huh 
and she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it 
are you a oh so they wanted any anybody 
do n't have to work at ti 
uh-huh 
well that 's interesting 
uh-huh 
i had no idea that was just for the employees 
and i could n't understand 
i kept getting these calls 
i thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called ti you know 
there is texas industries and different things 
uh-huh 
i kept hanging up on them for days until my husband told me what it was 
oh 
i did n't know 
well if you work for ti you 're supposed to get a prize is what i heard 
and if you do n't work for them you 're supposed to get cash 
yeah 
but then on the letter it says cash or prize 
they really oh 
well the prizes are pretty nice 
the uh he brought a booklet home 
and depending on how many calls 
i think three was the minimum 
but it went up to i do n't know nine or ten 
how many calls have you ma- had 
i do n't know 
gobs 
well it sounds like a lot 
this is going on my fourth week to do it 
oh my 
and some of the prizes were you know pretty nice 
well like what 
tell me 
but i did n't oh i wish i had that booklet here 
oh i think i do 
it 's right here 
uh i 'll look at the end because those would be the best ones 
okay 
yeah 
uh well they have some watches that look really nice 
there 's a one that 's got some diamonds on it 
for how many calls 
does it say 
well it says f i have n't quite figured that out 
i thought it was eight or nine 
but seems like too nice a prize for nine just nine calls does n't it it 
uh-huh 
says when we have enough calls from you you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and and explanation how to redeem for gifts 
are you listening to him 
uh-huh no 
i 'm trying not to 
he 's telling me to start the grill 
okay it says oh 
it says three for a b gift five for a c gift et cetera 
and this only goes up to f 
so i thought that was somewhere around nine 
but anyway it 's got these beautiful watches on it 
let me see what else 
it has a uh uh clock radio that also plays uh uh you know uh tapes 
then it 's got oh some binoculars and some pretty brass lamps 
it 's got some oh a food processor 
so it 's not all stuff that ti makes 
oh no 
i do n't 
i have n't seen anything in here that ti makes 
the mister coffee the double mister coffee you know the two 
oh and there 's a phone in here that 's hilarious 
it has a button you can press 
and if you get a call you do n't like then it makes machine gun noise 
i 've never seen that before then there 's an attache case and cordless telephone 
and then there 's a card table does n't have any chairs just a card table 
oh some more jewelry and suitcases 
and have you seen those univer- um anniversary lamps where the little balls go around 
uh you mean the clocks 
yeah 
clocks 
yeah 
is what i meant i can 
i 'm going crazy 
my daughter 's playing the piano 
and i can n't think 
oh god 
it 's um got one of those 
and well it 's got a lot st- i mean pages and pages 
it 's got wheelbarrows i 'm trying to look for something 
a lot of kitchen stuff lots of kitchen stuff the mixer a toaster a waffle maker popcorn popper all kinds of stuff like that 
and here 's where here 's a calculator 
but it 's not even made by ti 
is n't that funny 
did they mail that to you 
or he brought it to you 
he brought it home 
huh 
i believe it came in his uh his mail 
here 's some here 's a camera and a dustbuster and some tools someone a lot of tools a man might like you know 
yeah 
so you 're bound to find something you want 
oh yeah 
you 're bound to 
all kinds of phones and clocks 
and and uh here 's more jewelry 
and oh there 's even pictures and little porcelain things to put on a coffee table 
oh here 's some brass animals brass candlesticks 
they 're pretty 
so i 'm sure you 'd find something 
yeah 
and uh 
well you know 
and there 's even some silver plated bowls and stuff 
there 's a lot of stuff 
it 's a it 's a big booklet 
uh well do you know you have a ten limit a ten minute time limit 
oh no 
and then well that 's okay 
and then they come on and tell you 
and they they tell you got five seconds to say good-bye 
you 've talked enough oh oh well it 's been fun 
this is my first time to do it 
we 'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else 
right d- uh do you yeah 
let 's see 
oh i tried exercise classes 
and i never would go 
we find we joined ex- 
my husband keeps telling me to i we- i went back to college a couple of years ago 
so i sit and study 
i sit in class 
and i have really ballooned up since then 
and so he 's says i ought to join one of those that makes you go 
but 
yeah uh-huh they do n't either 
well well the first one i joined they went out of business 
and they transferred it to another one that was really far away 
they 're and you 're saying it does n't then you pay all that monthly stuff you know that 's a very common experience 
uh-huh and we were going to do it 
there was four of us together 
well then forget that 
it was n't near me 
you know uh-huh no 
and then the second time i was going to do it at richland college 
and we 
i just get with another friend 
and we 'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we could n't find the place 
yeah that 's funny 
so my husband 's just discouraged me on those things 
right 
well if you if you can make yourself do the tread mill i mean gosh that 's a good workout 
oh yeah 
my husband said he 's never joined a course right 
and i got one of those jane fonda workout tapes that i dubbed from a friend 
uh-huh 
that did n't last long 
i got one of those after i had a baby i think 
yeah 
right 
each one of those puts on a few pounds does n't it 
how many children do you have 
definitely two 
yeah 
i do too 
two 
a girl 
one 's in college 
so i do n't have a have a baby anymore 
oh lord you 're lucky 
well i 've got a stepdaughter 
she 's in college 
oh well 
so there 's where the money goes 
yeah tell me about it 
tell me 
where 's you ki- 
my lucky husband 's putting two of us through is n't he lucky 
two 
well me i 'm going and my daughter down in austin 
we uh 
yeah 
right 
so uh i 'll probably have to sell the prize i get 
where you going to school 
uta right here 
and what are you doing 
well i 'm um going to be certified as an english teacher and an esl teacher you know english as a second language 
yes 
i do 
i just got my certification 
you 're kidding 
huh-uh 
oh that 's 
the test is a booger it the test the exit test 
interesting pardon me it 's hard 
it 's hard 
oh no 
it is so hard 
really 
really 
how are the other ones 
i have n't taken any of the exit tests 
see i did n't have to take any other exit test because i 've been teaching for quite a while 
oh yeah 
before they started 
but i 've heard they 're terrible 
all this stuff really hum 
bilingual is just horrendous 
i 've had friends fail that twice 
oh really 
i did n't know any of this 
none of my friends have failed the english or the education ones 
good 
and i really i really ought to take those quickly while i still remember something 
yeah 
right after you get out 
i know i know 
boring 
and they really do n't help you a whole lot 
now see i went to et 
and i took one course through twu 
but most of the good training i 've got has been through dallas just teaching esl see i 'm 
you 're kidding uh-huh oh they give you yeah oh oh 
a chapter one teacher 
okay 
what types of music do you like to listen to 
well i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing 
i do n't know a lot about classical music so far as uh any background in music 
but it 's the the music i enjoy the most 
how about you 
i like classical music also 
i uh like you i do n't know a whole lot about it 
and i i would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff 
but i 'm not sure which composers or which it is that i really like 
right 
so i kind of hesitate to buy something 
uh-huh 
there are certain kinds i like and certain kinds i do n't 
i tend to listen to the classical music uh on the radio a lot 
there 's uh one particular well there several stations in this area that play uh classical music all the time 
but there 's one in particular that is on both am and fm so i can listen to it without uh worrying 
it 's cute though because my children when they get in the car and i have uh the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else 
because naturally that is n't their taste at this point in time anyway 
yeah 
yeah 
i understand that 
are are you involved in music 
uh no 
not really 
my husband is 
but not i do uh the world a favor 
and i do n't sing aloud to anybody but myself 
well my whole family uh is somewhat musical um and not from training but just because we sing in our choir 
and my daughter 's quite involved and all that sort of thing 
so um i think that one of these days maybe she 'll get involved in classical music too because that 's usually what happens if you unless you get into rock which is n't her voice style 
so 
yeah 
i yeah i i do n't care for rock at all 
i guess i 'm real old fashioned in my musical tastes 
no 
i 
well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious 
yes 
it 's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning 
now i do like folk song 
um and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that you know kind of still hang around 
right 
but um but the more popular music i do n't care for usually 
yeah 
um even when i was a teenager i did n't really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked um a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular rock and roll kind of thing although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll 
yeah 
i agree with that too 
i guess it makes me think i 'm young again 
yeah 
now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the new age and all that stuff 
is n't that the truth 
it 's funny 
in fact it 's interesting to me that so many of the songs 
now i grew up in the late fifties and early sixties 
and so much of the music that was popular at that time has come back 
uh-huh 
and you you do n't hear everything all the time 
but you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it 
but it 's the same stuff um which is always kind of funny 
right 
um and i remember my older sister 
i have a sister who 's sixteen years older 
and at the time that i was a teenager late teenager i guess i can n't remember the year smoke gets in your eyes became popular 
i think it was done by maybe the platters or something 
uh-huh 
then 
and she laughed 
and she said well you know when i was a teenager that had been you know 
some years before she said that was a a version of you know a song then 
and she said it 's very similar 
but they 've changed a little bit 
she said i like the original version better 
well they did it again about two or three years ago 
and i laughed again 
i said oh no 
here we are 
crops up every so often 
right 
right 
it does indeed 
i listen to um the christian radio station when i 'm in the car k l t y 
uh-huh 
and i like to listen to some of that 
yes 
now that there there 's some wonderful christian music when you can find good stations 
music yeah 
uh the pro- problem that i found um in this area is that the there there is inconsistency in the quality here 
uh-huh 
if you get someone who 's very good at selecting it 's okay 
but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge 
and they they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality 
yeah 
where do you live 
you know uh i live in the uh washington dc area rockville maryland 
ah i thought maybe you lived in dallas because that 's the complaint i make to my husband about the radio station too 
i said oh they 're playing one of their ten songs 
yeah 
it seems like every week they pick ten 
and they just play them over and over 
and it uh-huh 
and i i you know there 's so much available that i do n't understand why they do that 
yeah 
yeah 
but um now my children have have sometimes um 
well they 've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of christian musicians that come for our youth group at our church 
and um and the- when they buy a tape or something sometimes that 's fun because it 's different and something i 've not always heard 
and you know i enjoy that 
uh-huh right 
my husband likes uh sandy patty songs 
he likes to sing those in church 
he 'd buy all the sound tracks he could get his hands on it if he had the money to 
oh wow 
yeah 
that 's nice 
so is your husband a singer 
well just an amateur singer 
he sings in the choir 
and he likes to do special music and stuff at church 
right 
yeah 
well that 's a good thing to do 
yeah 
yeah 
i like to hear him sing 
he does a good job 
that 's nice uh 
well do you have children 
no 
not yet 
we 're expecting a baby in july 
well wonderful 
i guess we 'll start listening 
that 'll be a musician 
yeah 
maybe so 
we 'll start listening to children 's music 
oh there 's some wonderful christian uh children 's tapes you can uh you can get 
yeah 
there are 
and i know when my children were younger um we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked 
um there was an agape music group 
and um i some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really um very memorable even though my children are now 
uh-huh 
my youngest is almost sixteen 
oh uh 
but i still find some of the same tapes i uh some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy 
uh-huh 
um there 's one that 's um a little girl singing practice makes perfect 
uh-huh 
and uh she 's playing the piano 
oh 
and so she she gets the wrong note every now and then 
but then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect and then you know talking about that so far as christian life too 
and it 's really cute 
that yeah 
that sounds really cute 
yeah 
uh i tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they 're still in the womb 
and i said then when when it 's born you can hold it and sing that again 
yeah 
right 
and maybe it 'll comfort her you know when she 's fussy and stuff 
yeah 
well do you know something 
what 
because i have always played classical music uh or classical style 
it 's not always classical as you know the official uh word might go 
but um even when i was pregnant of course i listened to that 
and when our first child was you know an infant um of course i when i was around the house i played that music too 
when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale the music scale 
uh-huh huh 
someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that 's true 
how strange 
and it was somewhat melodious 
in other words it was n't just you know it was really funny 
uh-huh 
babbly 
i 'll say 
that is 
well we 'll have to keep up with that then 
right 
right 
i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music the the wilder stuff was around when my uh older children were were you know adolescents early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first get ask for a radio of their own and so on um this same child um really listened t- to more um ballady or um pleasant sort of songs rather than and even classical rather than the uh real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to 
uh-huh 
huh 
and i i never i did n't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and would n't do it anymore 
right 
yeah 
have something to rebel against 
right 
but uh but i must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice 
i like that 
yeah 
that 's good 
yeah 
variety is good 
yeah 
well i guess that covers it 
it was real good talking to you 
well it was nice talking to you 
and good luck with the baby 
um well thanks 
um bye 
bye-bye 
okay 
if you want to go first go ahead 
oh i think i think that the um woman 's role has come a long way 
we 've gone more into the business aspect of uh like i say of i do n't know working more 
and then and we i think we 've even gone into more of the labor aspect of it also uh with the pay and everything you know 
yes 
definitely 
well i feel that uh i we 've missed as far as the top jobs go you know the the higher echelon 
yeah 
uh-huh 
because if you look at most corporations there is n't a woman you know that 's on the board of directors or that type of thing 
they 're mostly all men 
um-hum 
there there may be a few 
but very incidental 
yeah 
and uh i i really think that it 'll be a long time probably before we see that 
in one sense um i- i 'm an older person in my fifties 
so i feel that we 've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today you know that that they 're not in the home by choice anymore 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
i- most of the ti- you know 
e- even if you want to say home you c- you really can n't 
oh and a lot of times you can n't 
yeah 
i- i- i- y- you know it 's it 's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living 
and i do n't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff uh you know as far as your medical insurance and uh just groceries and gasoline and all this you know 
um-hum 
so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we ha- we 're allowed to vote in you know like you say we 're out in the labor force 
but i think we 've lost something too 
yeah 
my mom um she 's a housewife 
and well there 's twelve kids in my family 
so my mom never could really work you know because she was kind of pregnant from day one 
she never really had a chance to work 
oh god love her yeah 
uh she worked before she got married 
but um she um she does n't believe in 
she 's very old fashioned 
she does n't believe in the woman working unless she has to 
that 's what i mean 
and and you know there 's a lot of truth to that 
yeah 
if you 're not going to have a family then that 's fine 
then y- you know a career is is a smart choice 
um-hum 
and i think it 's great 
but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility 
um-hum 
and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know uh i think that both the mother and the child lose 
um-hum 
and i think that 's why there 's so many problems you know with kids today because they do n't have the family roots anymore 
yeah 
you know i 'm not saying that that it 's totally gone 
but it 's nothing like what it used to be you know in that sense 
yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
um and also like my mom my mom thinks 
and i mean she she 's kind of right with it 
when both um partners of of the marriage work she feels that that 's taking more away f- that 's that 's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work you know like for for the men that do n't have jobs 
oh definitely 
if you know she feels that if those women were n't out there just because they want to do it 
she said that you know they could stay at home 
that 's right 
they do n't want to take care of the kids and the house and that kind of thing 
and wi- yeah 
that 's very true 
but then they should n't have a family 
um-hum yeah 
that 's what i 'm saying you know 
i i think it 's great that women have a choice today that there are ways to prevent families you know 
um-hum 
like those basically there 's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies 
yeah 
there 's no need to have children if you do n't want them 
well w- what do you think about that 
do you think that um 
wh- d- what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business 
that 's fine 
that that 's the freedom of choice 
i uh-huh 
and i i agree with that 
because anyone who has children that does n't really want them is n't going to be a good parent 
uh-huh 
uh well i should n't say they 're not going to be a good parent 
they wo n't be a caring parent 
um-hum 
like they wo n't have that 
or they wo n't be as good as they could be 
uh right 
tha- that 's what i mean 
it they 'll feel like it 's uh a job 
um-hum 
i- it 's not like something that they really wanted 
like i had three children 
and i mean i i i wanted every one of them 
um-hum 
i 'm not sorry i had any of them 
and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them 
yeah 
you know i had to work 
but i tried to make it as painless as possible 
uh-huh 
in fact at one time i worked as a second shift 
and uh uh one saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table 
and the kids were talking 
daddy this 
daddy that 
daddy this 
daddy that 
and i was sitting there 
it was like i did n't belong anymore 
and it was because i had worked for about nine months 
and when they were coming home i was going to work 
uh-huh 
and i was n't there at supper time or bed time 
or they could n't tell me what went on at school because they 'd be coming in the door i 'd be going out 
exactly 
so we were i i felt i was losing my family 
uh-huh 
and that 's why i said that 's it 
i either have to quit or you know try something else 
so i went on third shift 
um-hum 
and i worked that shift for eleven years 
oh my 
yeah 
bless you 
yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home 
uh-huh 
you know and i feel that 's very important 
it really is 
and it 's too bad be- because mothers miss out on so much too 
um-hum 
so i mean in the sense that uh we 've come a long way 
yes 
but we 've sacrificed a lot to get there 
yeah 
i i agree 
and uh i really think that if uh like after second world war when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because the men were n't here anymore 
uh-huh 
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence 
and they just enjoyed the income the extra 
exactly 
a man can afford the necessities 
a woman affords the luxuries 
um-hum 
and i notice today 's uh kids you know 
like we had apartments before we had homes 
um-hum 
and we had to walk before we had a car 
exactly 
and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday 
what what do they get 
they get a car 
oh i know 
and uh it to me it 's like we 've lost our values in this country 
uh-huh 
we really have 
and i i 'm not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything 
but i i do n't think if you 
unless you earn something and you 've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it 
because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me 
um-hum 
you 'll take better care of that 
and you 'll prize that possession more than someone handing something to you 
exactly 
um-hum 
and it 's just like college too 
i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine 
but i do n't think you should pay the whole way 
see yeah 
see now um my parents there 's no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college 
of course 
and um so far there 's only two of us that have gone 
and my older brother has paid his entire way 
and i 'm on my 
i have six weeks left 
f- and i 'll you know i 'll graduate 
and i paid my entire way 
and that 's the way it 'll go down the line 
and like w- i do n't have a car because i 'm paying for college 
if i want a car 
my parents always said if we wanted a car we paid for the car 
and we paid for our own insurance 
and and i think that 's right because 
yeah sure 
but i 'll bet your values are a lot higher you know y- y- and your self esteem and the w- the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense than these kids that do n't have that responsibility 
um-hum 
yeah 
um-hum 
like i 've had my you know 
like um like i know kids up here that have their own cars 
their money 's just given to them 
like they still get their allowance 
they 're twenty years old 
and they still get an allowance 
well i 've held a summer job since i you know i was in the eleventh grade 
and i have had to take care of my own money 
i have my own checking account 
i pay for my own life insurance 
and i know a lot of kids that do n't even know 
wh- i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance 
and their mouths just drop to the floor you know 
you that that sure yeah sure 
they probably do n't even have any 
well if they do they do n't know of it you know 
or yeah 
exactly 
and that 's what i say 
y- you 'll b- you 'll be so much better off for it as you get older 
because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff 
but it 's because you 've been there and no one can tell anyone anything any- you know you 're going to find out for yourself 
uh-huh 
oh i know 
but i mean i do n't think you should just not listen to advice 
even if you do n't take it just listen 
uh-huh 
you know there 's there 's no harm in that whereas sometimes you can n't even get that from a kid you know just attention you know 
uh-huh 
but really uh 
wh- what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing women in politics and president someday maybe 
um 
actually i think abortion 's going to take a turn where there 's not going to be as many because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular 
i mean i realize that they are popular now 
but i think i i r- i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives 
and with the abortion it i i do n't think there 's going to be many abortions 
but i do n't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion 
yeah 
yeah 
i think it 'll be freedom of choice 
yeah yeah well i i still think people have a choice 
i you know if you can live with it and it 's not you know your conscience is clear then i mean a- all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not 
uh-huh 
exa- 
yeah 
i do n't know 
um-hum 
i mean no one 's said for sure you know 
yeah 
but 
i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i d- i think it 'll definitely be freedom of choice 
uh yes 
yes 
um-hum 
which i mean i think it should be anyway 
i i do 
i 'm catholic 
and i we we 're not supposed to you know say that that 's okay 
but i really feel that it 's freedom of choice 
no yeah 
i do 
because i mean you as an individual what you would do that that to me is your business 
um-hum 
and uh 
and and different circumstances call for different things 
exactly 
exactly 
that 's 
all right 
okay well um we lived 
i grew up in san antonio 
and uh i was used to the heat 
and i was used to what could n't grow down there 
and uh we had a small um farm house out in castroville which is just uh to the west of san antonio and we did a lot of gardening out there and uh mostly in raised beds so we could keep the uh soil uh nice because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil very hard to to grow very hard to cultivate 
uh-huh 
and when we came up here uh to california uh 
we 're in the monterrey area 
and it 's very uh nice sandy soil rich soil 
and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow so we 've been out here um well really in in the house since december 
uh-huh yeah how fine 
and we 've been uh planting flowers that we could never plant in san antonio uh because the heat would just dry them up after you know about uh three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started and here they uh are supposed to last year around and so we have some really pretty flowers growing 
um 
oh boy 
and uh we 're at the edge of a forest area 
so there 's a lot of uh pine mulch 
uh-huh 
uh just about anything you would want in texas as a gardener is here uh just around us 
you know we got here at the end of about a four year drought 
uh we 've had a whole lot of rain 
uh it 's been raining pretty much continually now uh off and on maybe one day of break for about a month 
so 
oh really 
yeah 
we 're getting replenished 
and so there is 
uh when i first came here it everything was yellow 
the grass was dead everywhere 
and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful 
and i hope that it holds out here after the summer 
hm wow 
but uh that has been uh the major change that we have noticed in gardening 
and that 's about the extent of what we 've done just a little bit on the patio and uh and waiting for the the rain to subside so we can mow 
we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend 
but um we 're just so happy to see green 
it 's just so nice 
we have n't really done too much else other than that 
hum 
well we um we just moved to our first home 
and we had lived in a condominium before 
so we did n't have any lawn and garden type duties 
so we 're just learning the ropes here 
and but when we moved in um 
uh-huh 
our backyard has so many big tall trees in it that um there just there was n't even a blade of grass in the backyard 
uh-huh 
so we 're you know going talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things and learning about different kinds of grass 
we trying to go grow grass 
and it just seems so funny to me that when i grew up in missouri 
and you did n't have to worry about growing grass there 
it just happened automatically 
oh uh-huh uh-huh so do you have to get a shade tolerant grass 
is that what you 're 
so yes 
we are 
we we tried we planted some fescue last um fall and it- it 's really really pretty and um and green 
uh-huh 
it stayed pretty pretty green throughout the winter 
and uh and it 's pretty goo- 
it 's not as thick and as nice 
it does n't look like it can withstand too much you know 
oh 
okay does that last through the summer too 
it 's supposed to die off like in august 
and then you re- replant it in september 
and uh so but we do n't 
um oh 
the saint augustine and all that supposedly was back there just was n't 
like i say there really was n't even one blade of grass in the backyard 
uh-huh 
and um so mostly you know we 're not even to the point where we 're getting into flowers and flower beds or or even gardens that 
we 're just saying let 's get some grass 
uh-huh just get grass to grow 
let 's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much you know 
i know uh-huh well when we had our house um out in castroville the problem with ours is that the uh plots there are a third of an acre 
uh-huh 
and trying to keep grass alive during a summer on uh a piece of ground that big was expensive 
oh yeah 
and to water it 
and uh eventually well especially when it was so bad last year 
well i guess it was the year before now uh 
it was so hot that year 
that was the year that i think it started out a hundred in february 
oh no 
um we were just watering all the time 
finally what we did was we said we 're going to have to let the back yard die 
it 's going to have to do whatever it 's going to do because we can n't really afford the front yard 
on its own 
uh-huh 
and uh so when we left you know the back yard had and the saint um 
i think it was saint augustine that we had 
um i- it had held onto a small portion 
but primarily once the weeds start in the back yeah we were just re- you know resigned to 
well the only way we were going to fix this one is that you know if you plow it all under and put everything back on top of it again 
uh-huh 
but i do n't know 
that 's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money 
or you would spend so much money trying to keep a a large lawn alive 
that was the only thing i did n't like about lawns 
and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you do n't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out 
hum yes 
so 
and it 's pretty remarkable because growing up we 've always had a beautiful lush green lawn 
and we never 
there was no such thing as watering your lawns in missouri 
uh-huh 
i mean it just happened 
uh-huh 
and um so it 's been real fun here to see 
there 's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies 
and a lot of people um 
um we live in north of dallas 
uh-huh 
and um 
arlington area 
plano 
okay 
plano 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
up north 
and um and so there 's a lot of uh market up here since it 's kind of the area that people are moving into in the dallas area and big market for for yards yard work 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i imagine 
so well everybody it seems like everyone is so particular especially in um the dallas area 
uh-huh 
you know there 's there 's so much money 
and everyone can afford 
they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn 
and another thing i 've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes 
the area is so small that they take great pride in being able to to use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice 
uh-huh 
yes 
they do 
i noticed that they 're really putting in small back yards because they have these most of the houses have the alleys that run behind 
uh-huh 
and so that really cuts into your backyard space 
and but we do n't do our work here out of enjoyment so much just 
right now we 're just this is we just moved in in september 
so we 're just still at the point where we 're talking about the the necessity 
yeah uh-huh right 
i know 
oh it 's it 's awful the first house 
well th- our house in castroville was the first one too 
and uh we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening would run into and the time that it took especially when you start mowing 
uh-huh 
and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking 
and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water 
and uh the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground uh irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just 
that was the way to go if you could do it 
uh-huh yeah 
people that were building the new homes that put those in 
that was that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient 
they would just turn it on 
and the timer would run 
and it would water their lawn 
and they did n't have to worry about it at all 
um 
and that was so nice 
but we did n't have that luxury 
so we were dragging the the sprinkler around everywhere 
and uh so i hope you can find uh 
i do n't know what type of grass grows in uh the real shady areas 
i remember the guy that was on the radio um they had a gardener 
and he 
i do n't know 
i had this one well i 've still got the book 
it 's um i think it 's just called texas gardening 
and it talks about the different grasses to use uh for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas 
uh-huh hm 
and but there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant 
but i do n't remember what it is 
but it 's got like a boot on the front of the the book 
uh-huh 
it 's just a real fancy decorated boot 
it 's like texas gardening 
and it talks about um you know different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it 
and it goes into the full gamut of gardening you know everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to uh how to prune 
but one of the things i do remember was when it talked about uh the grass and there there being the shade tolerant types of grass 
grass 
and i think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used 
oh um 
but i do n't remem- i do n't remember if it was raleigh and saint augustine or or what 
or what it was 
but i do remember they had used a blend 
well we 're going to have to do that because um we have the shade the trees 
this is an established and older home that we moved into 
and um the trees are just so tall 
and there must be what ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that like even if its raining you can go out in our back yard and not get wet 
uh-huh oh but that 's so neat because so many homes do n't have that 
so you 'll be cool all year around in the summer 
that 's great 
well that 's what we 're looking forward to 
and that 's what they say the payoff is 
but 
uh-huh it makes the biggest difference when you have the big old trees 
um 
and the people that moved in next to us they built a new house on the empty lot 
and they just had their brand new little trees 
they did n't have any shade 
they any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day 
too hot 
yes 
so oh that 's great that you have them 
are they oaks 
well there are all different kinds 
that around there oh that 's even better oh uh-huh 
there you know there are some oaks magnolias and like plum trees peach trees 
there are some big big tall oak trees one across 
where do you get most of your news 
i watch the macneil lehrer news hour 
and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends 
where where are you 
i 'm in dallas 
oh yeah 
are you in dallas also 
no 
i 'm in san antonio 
oh really 
okay 
um-hum i get my news from a combination of sources 
i take the the paper everyday and i read it on the way in to work on the in a carpool 
um-hum 
oh really 
uh-huh 
and uh and i watch the uh actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work 
and then you know usually over lunch there 'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news 
um-hum 
i normally find that uh i- i 'm probably the most um news hungry of my friends 
so i do n't we do n't normally talk about the news at lunch 
i i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week but um i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning 
um-hum 
oh yeah 
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work 
um the macneil lehrer news hour is on uh public television and i enjoy that quite a bit 
um-hum 
yeah 
um one of the women that i work with her husband is iranian 
um-hum 
so here lately with all the middle eastern news we 've had some very interesting conversations over lunch 
i will admit i work with uh someone who 's iranian 
and he definitely has a very different slant on the news 
um-hum 
he 's very very skeptical of the news media 
and i will admit i 'm reasonably skeptical also 
but he 's i do n't know uh he 's mu- much much more so 
it 's it 's sort of interesting though because he does bring a a much um different perspective with all the gulf goings on um 
he was always speaking in terms of you know american imperialism reasserting itself 
and i suppose it 's a different attitude that we normally do n't hear in the country 
um-hum 
well i i uh i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize 
um-hum 
true um 
the 
i understand that the macneil lehrer probably does n't 
they um tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story 
um-hum 
they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time 
sort of like the uh what is that abc 's nightline 
um-hum 
uh well i guess they only normally stick with just the one um story 
but they they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories 
they do n't report on every murder and shooting that happened in in every little town 
no 
no 
it 's very much national interest news 
yeah 
a lot of times they end up um with these panels of experts 
and they go back and forth where everyone 's giving some opinions 
and sometimes that 
i i do n't know the value of that because um i saw plenty of jokes and and um oh editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making their living during the the gulf war 
i 've been getting a kick out of those lately 
um-hum 
although um 
i 'm i 'm only twenty five 
so i 've never actually been through a period of war and i do n't know anyone in the military 
um-hum 
and i do n't have a lot of background knowledge in uh military strategy and and weaponry and and all that kind of stuff 
and i thought the generals were very interesting 
now when they started to speculate i i saw that for what it was and thought all of these guys do n't know what 's going on 
um-hum 
but i thought they were the- they were interesting 
and and they shed some light on what was going on for me 
i will admit it 's interesting 
i i i 'm twenty six 
so i do n't have any more experience in that than you 
um it it it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know 
there were some that were screaming for air power 
there were some that were saying the air power was n't going to do it 
um-hum 
and they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does 
but these guys had a a uh national soap box to stand on and and express this view 
um-hum you know one of the the best uh television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a saturday morning on abc 
and it was for children and it was hosted by peter jennings 
um-hum 
and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio 
and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions 
and they they had all their correspondents in the different areas in saudi arabia and israel and and all 
they had them all uh on 
i do n't know what you 'd call it other than on line 
they had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person 
um-hum 
and that person would answer the question 
it was just very informative and interesting 
and uh i was real impressed at how abc handled uh translating the war for children 
um-hum 
yeah 
i i did n't see anything like that although i did uh 
i guess one thing that i found sort of interesting 
this is getting a little off the topic 
but there there is a a big push you kn- with the local t v stations to have little hot lines with um counselors to to help parents uh learn how to talk about their war with their children 
um-hum 
i thought that was a really unusual thing 
and our local heb stores here 
i do n't know if it 's heb statewide or whatever 
but they have videos that uh 
i do n't know if they still have them 
but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war 
um-hum 
i- it with the children 's aspect 
uh it was 
it was right 
it was something for children that that they they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and and uh getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing 
um-hum 
um-hum i suppose that is a valuable service 
that again not having uh lived through another war i do n't know if that 's a common thing that people thought of 
or if that was a a new concern with people 
well back during the vietnam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war uh the that type of technology just was n't at people 's disposal 
um-hum 
that 's true 
that 's true 
so i do n't think there 's ever been a war that 's been so thoroughly covered by the news 
and probably more importantly one that lasted short enough that that people 's interest did n't flauge too badly 
yeah 
i tell you what 
the first three days i was glued to the television 
i will admit the same thing 
i would come home and flip on macneil lehrer 
and i 
and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program and i i was just i was horrified and fascinated by what i was seeing 
had yeah 
i tell you what 
the the uh war start- 
let 's see was it a wednesday or thursday 
must have been thursday um 
and friday night i was i stayed up until two oclock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open 
um-hum 
because i was watching cnn 
and they would they would switch back to the one of their israel bureaus 
and the people would be standing there in gas masks 
and you 'd be hearing the sirens 
and it was just 
i was amazed 
um-hum 
i i did n't have that experience 
i i do n't have cable so i i 'm pretty much limited to pbs which i thought i thought they did a very good job 
oh 
um-hum 
um i 've got one question for you 
i you say you take the newspaper 
uh-huh 
um i i found the newspaper situation in dallas very interesting 
we 've got the one fairly well relatively weaker paper the times herald and then the morning news which has a very strong subscription 
um-hum 
does san antonio ha- 
you said san antonio right 
um-hum 
do you have just one paper 
or do you have several 
no 
there are two 
and they 're pretty close 
uh the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper 
i grew up near houston and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck 
um-hum 
and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up i mean the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff 
um-hum 
i mean it- it 's piddley stuff to pick a newspaper over 
and i enjoy 
the comics are better in this newspaper 
like this newspaper has the far side and some other comics that i enjoy 
and the other one has some weird ones that i 've never heard of 
so 
um-hum i i actually take both newspapers on the weekends 
i figure i 'm only taking on the weekend 
and i can afford that 
yeah 
i i find the news reporting in the the mourning news to be better 
but i i sort of have a liberal political slant 
and the mourning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial um outlook 
and my fi- my fiancee takes probably six sunday papers 
still i i get the times herald just to balance that out a little bit 
he takes both san antonio papers an austin paper both houston papers 
i guess he takes seven the san marcos paper and the new braunsfel paper 
but he 's a football coach at southwest texas state university 
so he 's getting all the sports sections 
um-hum 
and so you know he has these stacks of sunday newspapers that go unread unless 
okay 
um i guess um this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work 
uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess 
oh really 
but um 
what kinds of things have you done 
um well i 've made a lot of baby gifts 
aha 
it seem like that 's 
like especially lately there 's been so many babies that uh bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings um 
do you ever keep any of your stuff 
is n't that funny 
no 
i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that 
and i have very little of my own stuff 
and and it it 's kind of embarrassing 
people say let me see some of your work 
oh well can you go to 
yeah 
is n't that funny 
i guess i do have one thing 
um a friend of mine gave me a clock kit and i- i needlepointed the the face 
so and so 's house yes ooh 
and i uh kept that because she gave me that 
so 
that that would be definitely something you 'd want to keep 
oh yeah 
and it 's real neat 
was was the whole face done or just the numbers uh and and like minute marks 
um basically the the whole 
well no 
i guess the minute marks 
but the minute marks are done they 're like hearts 
oh 
and then the 
at the numbers they they 're kind of outlined and stuff 
it it was quite bit of work 
but you know it was a lot of fun too 
i really like doing stuff like that 
so 
i did some needlepoint years ago 
and then i got into the bargello 
oh what 's that 
well it 's an italian um needlework using using the uh 
i started to say the canvas 
but the uh hum 
the what what kind of cloth uses that 
i i 've just gone blank 
but it 's used wi- uh with yarn 
and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors 
huh 
like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you 're making a design like a geometric or whatever 
and it was used quite often in the colonial times to uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them 
wow well that 's interesting 
what did you what kind of things did you do 
what i did when when i was doing that was mostly pillows you know for sofas and so forth 
and i can n't find one that i 've done 
uh-huh oh 
it it 's one of those things 
i did n't i did n't give them away 
but i did n't know if it 's been my color choice or multiple moves or or what 
yeah 
and it 
i was so proud of them when i got them finished 
but i have no idea where they are 
tha- what did you call that 
bargello 
it 's b a r g e double l o 
huh 
that 's 
i 've never heard of that before 
i 've probably seen it though 
i suspect you i suspect you have 
i mean when you described it 
yeah 
i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess 
but um i 've never heard of it before 
and it 's really interesting 
um i guess i 've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past 
but i 've kind of gotten out of that 
i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows 
me too 
really 
yeah 
that 's interesting 
that 's yeah 
it is 
how did you know to choose this subject tonight 
that 's funny 
uh uh what 
how did you 
what kinds of decorations did you use with the bas- 
how were you decorating the baskets 
oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons 
um 
um i really wanted to do 
you know so many of them now have the ribbons where i 'm not sure how they do it 
but the ribbons they make them they like 
i do n't know how to explain it 
they make them hard you know 
like fabric that 's been stiffened 
yeah 
in yes 
i 've never done that 
and those are so neat 
i mean i would really like to do those 
but um 
i 've seen some 
and there there they 
i suspect they 're fairly simple because the one lady i 've seen i know that does it i 've never asked her any questions 
but she has three kids all under the age of like six 
and and they 're all a handful 
so it 's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly 
oh definitely 
yeah 
when i do um crochet it 's it 's usually the the lacy victorian type things like that 
oh 
and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture 
it 's like white glue 
and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then um allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i do n't know 
oh 
i was just 
there 's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that 's very similar that 's not going to melt too much with uh uh high humidity in in a room 
yeah 
that 's i think that 's what my concern was you know was n't really sure and how they would how they would last 
do you know what my concern is 
how will i dust this thing 
you 're right 
i 'm terrible 
no 
that 's true 
though that 's funny 
so many of my crafts 
well right now i 'm looking at a little uh uh quilted uh uh hanging 
it 's like it 's a flag 
and i do n't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth 
but it 's such a dust collector to be out and so forth 
yeah 
and most of my things are dust collectors 
uh and i hate to dust 
oh i know 
so that 's the first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean 
that 's funny 
no 
i just um 
i do n't i have really have gotten out of it 
i do n't do it quite as much as i used to um i guess because i i went back to school 
so i do n't have as much time 
oh you do n't have time 
now 
and i have two children also 
you definitely do n't have time 
so that it keeps me very busy 
but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance you know 
it 's really 
it 's so relaxing to just sit 
and but once i get started i can n't put it down 
i just 
that i have a similar problem 
i 've got to have time 
or i do n't even want to get into it in the first place 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all 
i know 
i started a project it 's been over a year ago that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for christmas 
you just did n't say which christmas right 
and i that 's what i keep telling this person 
well i did n't tell you what year 
what was this project 
um well it 's a it 's uh cross stitch 
and it 's a picture 
and it 's a wildlife 
it has deer and trees 
and it 's really beautiful 
but it 's going to be a lot of work 
and you know i 've i have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as i 'd like to 
you know it 's just so hard 
now this is this is done in the needlepoint 
uh-huh 
uh well i should n't 
it 's counted cross stitch actually is what i 'm doing 
and so it 's really since it 's counted you know it 's really a lot of work 
hm yes 
yes 
i do know 
yep 
i have done a little bit of that 
but i 've decided that that 's something that demands my time my my to- my total attention 
uh-huh 
and so i 've got to have total almost total silence 
i can n't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate 
it sounds like you 'd have lots of shading on that particular piece 
uh-huh 
yep 
it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish 
no 
it really is n't 
and i tell you really i could just kick myself for even starting it because i have a feeling i 'm never going to get it done 
i 'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life 
oh i 'm sure you 'll get it done 
but it just maybe not on the original 
obviously not on the original time schedule 
no 
that 's true 
i i just do n't know when i 'm ever 
it just seems like there 's just never enough time to to pick it up and do it 
you know it 's just really hard 
but i really do en- 
like i said i really enjoy it when i do 
it 's just hard 
just hard finding the time that can be dedicated 
uh-huh 
and there 's there 's so many other things that i i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts 
i 've made a lot of bibs and wall hangings 
and so you know those do n't take much time at all 
so it 's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them 
to that do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns 
or do you go out an buy a a kit like for a bib or something like that 
no 
no i usually just buy a pattern book 
i have several pattern books 
and i just go with those 
okay 
and then i buy the bibs separate 
usually i think it 's a little bit cheaper in the long run 
and then i just use whatever colors i want to 
i do n't usually use the colors they tell me to 
um 
and it it depends on what it is you know 
but some things especially letters if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to 
that 's what i would do too 
yeah 
i yeah yeah 
or or whatever i have 
there 's yeah there 's a a few designs i guess i 've done myself but not very many 
real simple ones you know i do 
i 've made i made a little uh uh little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny 
that 's ooh 
it was really easy 
i mean just just did a thumb print you know 
what with ink 
uh-huh 
or oh okay 
and then see i did n't cross stitch the actual thumb print 
you know that was just the ink 
and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth 
that was so simple 
oh that sounds really neat 
and it ju- it did n't take anything at all 
did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink 
and uh-huh 
um-hum and then i just 
okay 
so you 
just just like being finger printed 
okay um 
let 's see 
how do you feel about credit cards 
personally i do not care for them uh although i find them a necessity in business and so forth 
i i try to refrain from their use as much as possible um for a number of reasons one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them 
uh-huh 
the one i use uh of course for mostly only for business purposes is uh you know american express 
right 
and uh i 'm not i 'm not terribly in favor of them 
not for my own personal uh point of view 
right 
plus it uh has you know from an economic point of view it has increased our debt um tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion i believe is number uh at least that 's one number for this range of numbers i have i have heard 
yeah 
right 
wow 
wow 
do you use them frequently 
or 
well we uh me and my wife when when we have like extra money that we know we 're going to have and we can put it in our budget yeah we 'll we 'll use it 
but like last year i think we paid 
um i think it was like twenty something cents interest on our visa 
uh-huh 
and i think this this year we uh i think we used it for christmas 
and we got caught just a few days on our grace period 
and uh so we 'll pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars 
but we do n't like to do that at all 
yes 
and you know we i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly 
we uh we have several credit cards though 
um we have a gas card our visa and then of course the american express 
and i think we have a couple of department stores 
uh-huh 
but we use it the same way 
and uh 
i find the one i use mostly uh 
aside from the american express i do use my sears card 
uh-huh 
uh but uh i try as with the american express i try to pay it you know as it comes in 
right 
right 
so uh 
it 's it 's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill 
that 's usually how we do it 
i know when i travel or when i used to travel overseas quite a bit what i would do on my american express card is before i would before i left i would mail a check to to american express and you know have some idea of how much was there you know i 'd sent them you know several hundred dollars or whatever i felt i would spend and then use it then 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
yeah 
but uh you know for hotels and and so forth 
but uh but i knew that it was paid 
i knew i knew that i had that much credit going in 
right 
yeah 
sometimes you know sometimes i would go over 
but uh it would n't you know it would n't hit me in a big in a big way because i knew that uh i would have it covered in that respect 
yeah right 
right 
well that 's good 
i 've i do n't think we 've gone that far we 've been before to pay it in ad- you know in advance before we spend it 
but i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good 
uh-huh well i found you know i found in um in traveling overseas that uh often it would uh it would expedite things to have an american express credit card for uh for hotel bills and so forth 
uh-huh 
uh-huh oh really 
yeah 
plus i would uh when they uh would send the bill and they would automatically convert to the exchange rate 
right 
right 
so now the only t- time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically 
uh-huh 
uh for example i remember on one trip to france when i started planning the trip i think uh a dollar was worth nine or ten 
francs and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc drastically 
uh-huh 
and whe- when i finally got over there it had fallen uh two or three francs to the dollar 
so the 
wow 
so i got caught a little short in that regard 
wow 
but uh uh i i was anticipating you know my room would cost uh let 's say 
yeah 
if it were say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so or maybe twenty doll- 
right 
maybe it would be more than that 
it was more than 
it would average out to thirty five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate 
right 
right 
but then when i got back and i was working for the government at the time uh of course the government was several months behind on their per on its per diem for exchange rate 
uh-huh 
right 
yeah 
right 
so there 's a little consternation you know in trying to uh get them to compensate for the uh for the difference in the exchange rate 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
especially 
that that was the only time i really got caught short 
and i but as i said most most of all i try not to use them uh to any you know lavishly in that regard 
yeah 
yeah 
well that- that 's good 
and it yeah yeah well from where are you calling 
oh from the dallas area 
so you 're from dall- 
okay 
i 'm from maryland 
oh really 
yeah 
wow 
do you work for ti 
no 
i work for gte 
well really 
yes 
um uh i wonder how ti got gte involved 
well i know jack godfrey 
i know him very well 
i 've known jack for a long time 
and i 'm also in the speech business 
oh okay 
so when i heard that jack was going to do this i called him and asked for an application where i could participate in this 
oh okay yeah 
yeah 
and uh so that 's how i got involved 
yeah 
you have a very um very 
what 's the word 
your your speech is very exact 
oh thank you very much 
but uh as jack said i 'm one of the uh the old hands in the speech business 
oh really 
i- 
i 've i 've uh yes 
i i 've been doing it for twenty some odd years 
wow 
and so uh uh i was very much interested in uh getting involved in uh switchboard 
yeah 
so uh you work for ti 
right 
i i work in 
oh really 
uh a wafer fab yeah 
oh i guess we 're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording 
they yeah 
i think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject 
so i think you get ten 
so i think we 're okay 
okay 
right well all right okay 
fine 
well you have a good evening 
w- well you too 
it 's been pleasant talking to you 
same here 
take care 
good night 
bye 
hi 
how are you today 
i 'm great 
good 
well as a matter of fact i 'm before we started this conversation i was working on my pc at home 
yeah 
uh do you have one 
no 
i do n't have one at home 
i work on at work continually you know 
yeah 
but i do not have one of my own at home 
do you have 
what do you have at home 
we have an um 
actually it 's a ti computer 
but it is the ibm um clone 
uh-huh 
it 's not the ti pc from back when 
right 
from the the oldies but the goodies 
right 
it 's probably pretty close to what i have because i have the the same kind of thing at work 
i have a three eighty six s x which is ti computer 
but everything in is in ibm mode 
so 
uh-huh right right yeah 
that 's what we have um 
do you use it a lot at home what do you 
well i really do 
i um am an accountant 
and but i work at home 
uh 
uh-huh 
so you 're on it a lot 
so i use it for that quite often 
uh-huh 
um we have you know used some of it for some personal things 
we keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it 
um i 
since it 's tax season i 'm doing a lot of taxes 
so i do a lot of um a lot of that work on it as well 
uh-huh i was amazed when i took our taxes to our tax person 
and she works out of her home also 
uh-huh 
and the uh software that does the taxes is just incredible 
oh it is 
you know i mean she just you know 
i expected to go and you know drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later 
and you know she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little pc 
yeah 
you can 
it was great 
that 's right 
you know that 's wonderful 
i have often thought that that having one at home would be neat 
i just do n't know if we would really use it that much you know 
i we really 
we deci- we did n't decide to get one until i started working at home 
uh-huh 
then you know then we thought well we can use it for you know some personal things 
but it 
for us it really took you know a business application to justify the expense of it 
uh-huh 
oh definitely 
definitely 
i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer oh i guess probably three years ago for christmas 
and and you know it 's got some stuff on it 
it 's got a nice little word processing software on it you know and some budgeting type things and stuff 
and i do n't think she 's ever touched it you know 
so uh-huh really 
it just it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home 
you know she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know 
so 
right 
she could just as easily do those things by hand 
yeah 
just as quickly 
yeah 
now i know my boss has bought the software um that he can that hi- his checkbook is on on on on on a disk 
uh-huh 
and he goes in and prin- and types his checks on the screen and then hits print 
and they print out on the checks 
and and he 's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places and you know 
oh my gosh 
and he just whips out you know 
i saw him yesterday morning over there 
and and he paid his monthly bills 
and he just you know wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print 
and it printed out like ten checks 
and he just you know 
they 're perforated 
and he just ripped them off 
they go through just a continuous thing on the printer and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes 
huh right 
and there they went 
you know and he said you know i can balance my checkbook in seconds you know because it 's all in the computer you know 
right 
so 
and you know there 's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make 
that 's exactly right 
he said you know he said used to be i said i always sat looking for those you know 
he said this way there is n't any 
you know it does it for you 
so this you know 
there are some definitely some some advantages to it 
it 's just a matter of like you say are the advantages does it justify the cost if you 're using it strictly for personal business 
so 
right 
that 's true right i- i think in most cases i 'd have to say no 
not unless somebody really enjoys it or perhaps is using it for education 
right 
i have a four year old son 
and we have some education programs that he likes 
a little sesame street one and um we have another one that plays music 
yeah 
yeah 
and he really likes that one 
as he grows up he 'll be even more and more too 
that 's right 
that 'll be great 
yeah 
and 
i think about it 
i guess for for kids like as they get older 
especially now uh when they get to junior high school high school and even college 
uh-huh 
i mean my sister went to college um started about three years ago 
and she had to have a a computer 
really 
i mean it was like a necessity 
well yeah 
i 
she could n't imagine going through college without a computer 
i 'm going through right now 
i 'm you know going part time in the evenings 
and you know i do 
yeah 
everything has to be typed 
i mean they require it 
you have to type it you know 
uh-huh right 
and and so i 'm up here you know nights and weekends you know working on the little p- on the pc up here you know typing stuff 
so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home you know if you were if you were going to school 
sure yeah 
any more i do n't even know if they have if a college kid would have a typewriter 
well you 
i do n't know 
probably not even 
no 
i can n't no no 
and that 's they probably used to have it 
i just finished a a major research paper a couple of weeks ago 
and i could n't imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it 
uh-huh 
i i do n't know what they used to do before they 
well unfortunately in our family my husband and i went through college together 
and then he went on and got his master 's degree while i was working 
uh-huh 
and i 'm the better typist of us 
uh-huh 
and uh we just had a regular old typewriter not even a correcting one back then 
oh and you had to type all of his papers 
it was n't that long ago 
but i typed his master 's papers and things on a typewriter 
oh gosh 
oh boy to have a computer back then 
oh cut your time in half at least 
at least 
at least 
i mean 
and then of course you have some changes to make and do the whole thing over 
you take out a sentence 
on a computer you take it out bleep print it out fine 
yeah uh-huh 
take out a sentence on a piece of paper 
you you do the whole thing over 
that you typed that 's right 
that 's right 
you know i remember when i was working in high school you know i was working in an office and r- right after i got out of high school 
i continued working there for probably another year 
and we did everything on a typewriter you know everything 
uh-huh oh yeah 
but it 's amazing you know 
then when where you know someone would have you type a letter they did it right they did it right 
i mean they they 
the first time 
yeah 
they sit there 
and they go is this really what i want to say 
and you typed it 
and that was it 
and now you know people just send it back over and over and over and over 
yeah that 's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it 's brought about because people do feel like oh well we can just change it 
well we 'll try this out and see what it looks like 
yeah 
if 
you need to right use it as a just a 
yeah so yeah 
instead of knowing what they want to say before they ever they just you know play with it and which in a way is nice to be able to do 
right 
but you know it it gets a little out of hand sometimes 
i 've seen it get out of hand up here you know where you know we 've got a secretary that sits over here that 's keeping metrics right now and keeping up you know of all the letters i type how many cha- how many of them do i make changes on and on each letter what types of changes 
i know oh yeah 
are they typos 
are they because i could n't read it 
or people just change a like one word because they think it sounds better or whatever 
and you know she 's also keeping a percentage you know what percentage of letters am i retyping for whatever reason 
uh-huh 
and there 's like one week she she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed you know 
uh-huh i believe it 
and it 's like you know it 's ridiculous 
and and that was that was the high week 
but it 's running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types 
uh-huh 
well it 's good that she does that i mean bring it to people 's attention 
you know that 's well that 's exactly right 
you know she keeps you know keeps several weeks worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show you know look this did n't really need to be changed 
you know this is this is ridiculous and you know changing the w- you know at this time to now 
you know i mean that that 's the kind of things that you know p- that she 's keeping and showing you know that th- this this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste you know to change something like that 
right 
so anyway maybe you know maybe it 'll it 'll help in some way 
but i do n't know 
there there there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative 
oh i have to 
you know without a doubt 
without a doubt 
well i would like to get one at home some day 
we 've got a two year old son 
and so you know some day i would like to get even just like the video tell or something like that you know just to to be able to pull in so- sources from outside would be wonderful 
you know so 
right especially when they 're in school i think they would get a lot out of it 
oh i do too 
i do too 
the the on line um encyclopedia just sounds wonderful 
you know th- that sounds like such a great idea 
you know it 'd be nice to kind of fun to be to be able to play with it 
so i know my father had a pc 
and and when we were in high school it was always fun 
we could um link in 
and i do n't even remember now what it was called 
but you could link in and talk to other peo- talk to people all over the country you know 
uh-huh 
and like you have your own little code name you know 
and you 'd type in hi how are you 
and they 'd type back everything everybody 
and you 'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time 
and everything everybody said prints out on your screen as they 're typing it 
and it was just great fun you know 
it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance you know 
it was like a long distance phone call 
oh yeah uh-huh right right ooh 
so we were each limi- limited to like twenty minutes a day you know 
so 
uh-huh ooh 
that still could add up 
it 's oh it added up big 
well you know we my parents were divorced 
and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time you know 
so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it 
yeah 
you know i 'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations you know 
but when you 're doing the guilty father complex you know because he 's not there to watch us grow you can kind of you can kind of get all kinds of stuff 
you know that 's sad 
well it was nice to talk to you 
yeah 
oh well yeah you too 
have a 
have a nice day 
nice you too 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
uh-huh 
okay 
movies 
i 've i have n't seen too many lately 
i have kids 
and we went and saw the rescuers down under over the the break 
do do you have kids you take to movies 
or 
no 
no kids 
yeah 
it 's a wa- walt disney movie 
and it did n't get as you know as good a reviews as like the little mermaid the last one and got all kinds of academy awards and things last year 
but this one was i thought was excellent 
the 
was that the animated version 
i can n't both yeah 
it 's animated 
and i can n't believe how good they 're getting with their animation now 
it 's just just the special effects you know 
and in this movie this there 's this boy 
and he rescues this uh bald eagle 
and uh and it 's a huge eagle you know wing span of twenty feet or something like that 
and the boy actually rides on his back 
and he rides through the clouds you know 
and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out 
and it you know they 're flying all over with it 
and i mean i know there they there must have used been computers or something for animation this day 
but it was just so real realistic and lifelike and good animation 
what a good show 
even better than roger rabbit insofar as animation 
well roger was a composite one 
yeah 
there 's one there 's a movie i 've seen roger rabbit 
that 's not a recent movie 
but uh i enjoyed that show 
yeah 
that was made in a few i do n't know several years back i guess 
yeah 
yeah 
latest latest one i 've saw which was a mistake to go see was lionheart 
had claude van damme 
uh-huh 
he was he 's of course uh i guess he 's trained in this uh martial arts of some sort 
but the plot was bland 
the acting was bland 
it was just mostly centered upon his abilities to yeah 
chop them up huh 
chop them up 
exactly 
and 
this is supposed to be the the guy that 's uh replaces bruce lee or whatever or or the next chuck norris type guy 
yeah 
or he 's singular i guess you know 
you know how they can make any of any single one of them in a movie to be a super superstar of any sort you know 
uh-huh 
superstar 
uh-huh 
but chuck norris of course could be just about equal if not more 
um-hum 
and all of them i guess could be in that fashion or category 
hum 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
it was about uh a french foreign legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother 's wife who got who became a widow because he was selling drugs 
and he got killed 
keeps trying really uplifting huh 
so he deserts and goes to new york 
and he starts out by fighting to make money 
and then he moves on to l a to where that where she is to just help him out 
um-hum 
it was really i mean the hollywood really must think there 's some real dummies out there or something 
i do n't know 
yeah 
i have n't heard i had n't heard much about that movie 
i 
other than it was a chop them up movie 
but uh well i guess that 's one i wo n't go see 
well it was worth the buck i guess 
oh you went to the dollar movie 
yeah 
yeah 
they show up at the dollar movie right after they get come out 
you know they 're usually not not that great or did n't do that great anyway 
a lot of 
let me see 
let me see 
another movie i watched 
uh i want to see is uh that new one uh that won all those academy awards this year dances with wolves 
uh-huh 
i have n't seen that 
have you seen that one yet 
yeah 
what what what 
i i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting 
uh i guess what made it so good was the cinema- cinematography 
the the wide open you know spaces 
yeah 
and the music 
and uh well it had an excellent story line 
everything about it was good 
um-hum 
um i thought an excellent one too was misery with kathy bates and james caan 
i 'm not a james caan fan 
but that was a well directed and acted movie 
is that right 
i 'd recommend it 
it 's a little on the violent side but then what movie is n't anymore 
uh-huh 
right 
right 
yeah 
our movies today it used to be x 
and you know and pgs used to be rs 
and seems like the rating system you know is kind of switching that way a little bit 
well i have no objections to it 
it 's just uh 
and it 's a matter of your taste uh 
yeah 
yeah 
oh yeah 
it 's just that 
yeah 
it 's just that the rating system seems you know instead of having x now they have what nc seventeen 
yeah 
they just changed it because x had a connotation with it you know 
so 
and even on those type they do n't show what you expect 
right 
a lot of those are really violent type movies 
right 
really gory 
yeah 
that seems to be the norm of most movies 
but what the hey 
um 
this is america 
um let me see let me see 
one movie i saw i guess it was a while back red october 
yeah 
have you seen that one 
yes 
i have 
that was pretty good 
yeah 
i read the book before 
so i knew the story line going in 
but they changed some things in the movie 
was n't the same 
i thought the book was better than the movie 
but i thought the movie was really good as well 
i always wait for the movie 
i do n't have time to read the book 
yeah 
i do n't 
i read about one or two thick novels like that a year you know 
uh-huh 
that 's about all the time i can i can spare 
but that was a good show i thought you know 
i read about how they did uh an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine 
you know that was n't a real submarine you saw in the water 
it was it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the hollywood magic 
yeah 
it all those underwater scenes 
i thought you know 
it looked to me like it was a real submarine that was in the water you know 
they 
did me to that 's the magic of hollywood special effects 
yeah 
i hear this movie f x part two coming out is uh pretty good 
is that right 
did you ever see the original one 
i did n't 
it was uh 
you ought to rent the uh f x part one 
it does n't say part one 
but it it 's f slash x 
huh what 's that about 
a uh special effects man who somehow gets involved in this um 
oh i 'm not sure 
i can n't remember 
it 's been a while since i 've seen it 
but he he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody 
and he has to go underground 
and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done 
hm 
and uh 
to to fool people 
and 
right 
and using makeup and using the all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go 
and things huh all the tricks 
uh-huh 
that sounds like an interesting concept 
but you need to rent the first one first 
to understand what 's going on the second 
uh if if that is that the second one follows the first 
i do n't know if they have the uh original actors on that first one to that one 
uh-huh 
they 're supposed to be coming out with all these desert storm movies this summer too 
oh 
i expected those 
yeah 
i mean hollywood i mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there i think 
yeah 
well they had some 
in some of those you know they i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about lebanese and and you know and and americans 
uh-huh 
and they decide oh make it iraqis and americans you know 
and they just change the title and uh and reshot a few parts you know where they yeah you know where they could 
i guess they figured we would n't can n't tell the difference between an 
actual names will not be used 
yeah 
right 
eventually i 'm sure they will come out with the the the proper names 
yeah 
right 
it was such a 
it 
i guess they they 'll probably come out with a lot of movies you know 
it was it was such a rout though you know 
i do n't know you know 
they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or or about or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured 
latest story 
uh-huh 
kevin costner i understand is supposed to be play schwartzkopf supposedly 
is that right 
i do n't know 
that 's just one of the many rumors that floats around 
yeah 
or what you read 
um-hum 
well i think we 've probably 
pretty much used up the tape i guess 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's been about five minutes 
it 's been nice talking with you 
same 
and uh we 'll talk to you on the next go around 
keep on watching those movies huh 
okay 
bye-bye 
adios 
okay 
well 
first of all i 'm going to to tell you i- i have two little kids 
but they 're not in public school yet 
i i get i get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten 
ah 
yeah 
yeah 
so you have n't really uh dealt with that in a sense 
no 
but uh being one of these late in life mothers i 've listened to everybody else 's you know complaints as to wha- what what 's the matter with either their kids or the school system 
yeah 
so i 've been surprised 
yeah 
do are do you have school age kids 
uh mine are both out of school 
oh 
and uh you know i i 've in hindsight seen some things that i wished that you know i had done something about that was you know within my power or uh you know wish that in some ways we as parents had more control over what 's happening up there you know type thing 
such as 
um well just over the years there were situations that um uh came up that i did n't think were fair or handled correctly 
or the teachers did n't seem to be teaching anything 
of course it 's a little hard to tell from the the information that you get from your child you know 
um-hum 
they they bring things home 
and i was never one to believe everything my kids said you know about something 
but uh still i i question the ability of some of the teachers to uh really do a bang-up job 
and yet others i know are just wonderful 
they well i heard a a frightening thing 
a- actually i did n't hear it 
it was told to me or suggested to me uh that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of texas 
and i think it 's similar in in many other states if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage of uh people to teach math and sciences 
hum 
and somebody said well you know you could go in and and substitute teach at seventy five dollars a day 
and there 's always going to be you know uh somebody having a need for a math or science teacher 
i thought christ they 're letting me in to you know 
yeah 
this would be this would be frightening 
i do n't know anything about it 
that 's pretty interesting because just just because you know a subject matter does n't mean you can teach it 
right 
right 
and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter i do n't know if i 'd know how to handle that kind of a a group of kids 
oh yeah 
in fact i think that 's that 's one of the big problems today is the the way the kids behave or act and and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what 's going on in the class and disruptive 
i tell you what i 'm finding frightening 
and this comes from you know the the aging hippie near forty mother 
so i went through this period of supposedly you know cosmic social enlightenment 
i 'm on i 'm in the plano school system and living in richardson 
and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school 
um-hum 
and i used to think well that 's wonderful 
you know they can get a real life experience 
what i 'm seeing now uh in terms of kindergarten preparedness just from i- in in different preschools it 's like day and night 
um-hum 
and i wonder how do they handle a child who is obviously very ready and another child who does n't even speak english let alone know her colors 
yeah 
and they 're in the same classrooms 
and i guess also you 're going to see the first of the uh crack kids starting kindergarten 
my god i think it 'd be next year is what i 'd read 
i thought h- well how do you how do you weed those out 
yes 
some of those certainly have a lot of dis- difficulties you know with uh all sorts of things 
and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases 
and i was listening to npr the national public radio 
and they 've quoted statistics that i just about my throat just about fell into my toes 
they said at the bottom of the sat scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education 
oh wow 
yes 
that 's encouraging 
yes 
and i and i i got to thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry the people that t- took you know the lower level courses i sometimes wondered you know are they really even educatable or trainable 
and it 
my god you know uh 
are the rest of us who went for the big bucks you know staying out of you know wh- where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with these kids 
yeah 
i do n't know 
well that 's you know that 's an idea 
maybe there need to be some radical changes made 
do some things that are totally different and unheard of 
well y- you know you you sit here 
and you think about that 
at the same time you think god i just hope i do n't sound like a stage mother because i- right now if you ask my friends tw- put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children you 're going to have twenty hands you know up there 
oh you 're kidding 
oh no 
nobody has nobody has a non gifted child 
and i keep thinking you know uh gifted is is einstein or you know uh musical prodigies 
it 's it 's not a kid who 's you know precocious 
yeah 
you know what has you know ha- has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who 's above average is now gifted 
hum 
i do n't know 
that 's interesting 
i do n't know 
mine did n't did not fall into the gifted category 
oh do n't say that 
nope 
and i would never have said so either 
uh but uh they managed to get through although not always with flying colors 
uh in fact one of the incidents i was thinking of that my son had um he was struggling with senior english 
and i had a meeting with the uh vice principal and the english instructor 
and uh she showed me a paper that he had just handed in 
and she told me what she had requested 
and i read it 
and while it had you know a few little grammatical problems it was n't very long and so forth 
i thought it had some nice well thought out uh parts to it 
um-hum 
she gave him an f on that paper 
and i thought well now here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject 
and you give them an f on something that does n't seem that bad to me 
what are you telling that student 
you 're telling them that w- hey you might as well forget it you know 
um-hum well you see i think that that just harks right back to the elementary and junior high years 
because i have a stepson now who 's twenty five 
and uh i was just absolutely shocked uh the first time that i saw his schoolwork 
uh i remember being you know taught 
and i think you know i- you have to teach how to write an answer and you know how to construct a thought process 
um-hum 
and you know they can get a th- they can grasp the points 
can they convey the data verbally or in writing 
and that 's what 's you know really scary to me 
um i would really you know 
there 's such a a p- push a- among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate 
i would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age 
and if they can n't i mean if they have missed that training then somebody you know before you 're you you start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they 're thinking teach them these basic skills 
yeah 
uh it 's pretty sad to think uh about those who e- e- even today are graduating from school 
and they are telling that they do n't know how to read you know 
well my stepson you know i he went into the navy or air force 
i just really get my military 
i married into a military family 
and i do n't know 
i re- address them all as generals 
so i do n't offend anybody 
but uh you know fortunately for him he was n't dumb 
but boy he sure had trouble you know putting things on on paper 
yeah 
and one of the things that that they did for him they tested him 
and they said that he 's you know great in electronics 
but he you know he 's really does need the basic skills 
and they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training 
and at that point he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors 
oh 
this is the kid who who really y- you know barely made it through high school 
yeah 
and i keep thinking you know it 's not it 's really not too late at any point to do you know some 
that 's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it 
yes 
you would have expected them to be the last ones to 
but yes 
and i kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations 
but i think that for this kid it 's going to be you know his lifesaver 
otherwise he might have been driving trucks or framing houses you know from here to eternity 
yeah 
so i do n't know 
you know it does make me nervous 
well i can see why if you 've got little ones just coming along 
there 's a whole lot of stuff going on out there 
there is a whole lot of stuff going on out there 
and and part of me says i just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it does n't you know go on or send them to private schools 
and then the you know the old social conscience says you know i 'm not working i do n't need to work 
maybe i should volunteer to you know teach what i know 
yeah 
maybe adult literacy maybe you know composition writing maybe you know uh volunteering you know on a tutor line or though the even through the elementary schools for help with homework 
or the other part of me says is god i 've had enough kids 
do i real- 
okay 
do you have you noticed any new um trends in politics 
well the one i think is interesting is the california los angeles police chief who says he wants to -sign 
and did you hear yesterday that mayor bradley said that uh he should 
oh really 
no 
i did n't hear that 
think it i think what 's interesting is that uh uh the political activists jesse jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating 
i find it interesting that uh outsiders would bother to go in 
how do how do you feel about people like jesse jackson getting involved 
um i think sometimes it 's good for people outside 
they get a different pers- uh perspective on an issue and stuff 
so yeah 
i do n't see any problem with outsiders going in and getting a little bit involved 
wha- do you think gates should resign 
i think though that it should still be uh sort of up to the majority in the area 
i do n't know 
on something like that they would n't really vote on it or anything though 
probably so just because they were under his authority 
and he obviously failed somewhere along the line 
w- w- speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with john wiley price 
yeah 
what do you think of him 
oh um i think he 's got good intentions 
but i 'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right 
he 's an interesting person 
i was talking to someone who said that uh for all his obvious uh attention to efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the uh 
i guess he 's on the county uh oh board of supervisors or i think and that that that uh at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker and is really quite agreeable uh 
right 
uh-huh 
uh and that the stuff we see in the you know in the media is uh 
well he 's really just trying to make a political statement 
i i find that an interesting element of politics that we do n't that that most people would not know that john wiley price apparently is a is a you know 
course he 's got in this this deal over racism and uh you know name calling and all this 
but apparently he 's a a worker 
uh you may disagree with him 
but i i i find this whole 
what do you think of this uh fourteen one and ten four one in dallas 
oh i think that they should go ahead and go to the uh fourteen one 
i to me it 's just fair you know 
and equal it seem like every area should have an equal voice 
i -gree with you 
but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were going to divide up the districts 
no 
it was it was the strangest 
i 'm i 'm not sure it was gerrymandered 
but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff i i i guess i 'm a little cynical of the of the power base 
i- i- i- and i do n't quite understand why the power base uh does n't uh why they do n't go with fourteen one 
i- you know i- and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the uh i think it 's hispanics do n't vote because they do n't think that they have any affect 
and it 's 
yeah 
i i guess i am disappointed with dallas in that uh the fourteen one it 
i do n't know 
you can you can disagree with al lipscomb and uh 
what 's what 's the lady 's name 
diane ragsdale 
yeah 
you can disagree with uh what they 're doing and what they 're saying 
but in reality i think they 're they 're trying to represent their constituents 
yeah 
and i think dallas is doing itself a disservice 
i think they ought to get on with something important 
yeah 
they really make themselves look bad 
and i do n't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one 
yeah 
and i but i think even i even those people are 
it 's like pauken and box and these people 
i think it 's i find it interesting that everybody 's so busy politicking that the question is did we get anything good done 
it 's like this whole school issue 
a- are you involved in the schools at all public school this whole thing down there where they 're they 're trying to um uh you know devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools 
no 
huh-uh 
and and it all seems you know everybody 's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
i- 
i i have got to run to a meeting 
okay 
it 's good talking to you 
i do n't think we 've gone our our ten minutes 
but i think we 've we 've talked long enough 
was okay 
good talking to you 
so okay 
good night 
bye 
get us going 
okay 
are are you at ti austin 
or 
well i left ti in january 
but i signed up for this before i did 
oh that 's great 
no 
uh uh my daughter has talked to my daughter up here with us 
i have another one 
and she 's talked to students uh 
so i guess they have uh sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things 
so they 're 
if you 're a computer user 
so my daughter has talked to two students uh that were non tiers 
oh i think that 's a that 's a good idea 
so i guess 
oh yeah 
all right 
w- we 're on finances 
have you have you retired 
or uh 
oh no 
no 
no 
no 
oh 
actually i left ti um i had basically set my sights to leave ti when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety one because i i def- definitely need to make a little more money 
oh yeah 
and uh i have n't really accomplished that yet 
but i 'm trying 
oh yeah 
it 's uh that 's 
the finances 
i guess we 're on the subject of finances 
it is tough 
uh i 've been with ti 
i 'm just going to be fifteen years this year 
and that 's a tough thing uh the salary thing 
ti does n't quite always do it right 
well what about our our our financial budget 
well you you should have a lot of information on a budget then if you 're uh 
i wish i did 
i i hope you 're you 're a person who does things better than 
i- i do n't have a budget 
that 's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good oh long range planning budget mode 
um i 'm a single mom 
and i 've been just uh trying to get 
well you you you deserve an honor for that a gold star for that i guess 
thank you 
it 's nice to have someone understand that 
right 
sure 
h- how about yourself 
do you have a budget you live by 
well i guess i do 
i do have a long term budget bec- 
i got a daughter in college and one going to be in college 
so that i 've been thinking about that for quite a while 
now mo- monthly no 
i 'll tell you a funny story about budgeting 
uh i 've been married twenty six years 
and i did you know that the macho thing 
the man always did the bills for i do n't know fifteen years or more 
um-hum 
and i got so sick of it trying to balance the budget uh one 
and i always tried to show my wife you know here 's how you 
once a year i 'd say here 's how you do the budget in case i get sick 
or here 's how you do the checks you know 
right 
one day i gave her the checkbook 
and i said i 'm not doing this anymore 
you do it 
you learn it 
and i 've been happy ever since 
well that 's great 
how about your 
she does it all now for about ten years 
and i do n't even 
she complains to me about it 
she threatens me to give it back to me 
and i said i 've been a happy man since i have n't fooled with that checkbook you know 
so i know it 's a big pain to try to do that 
it really is 
it it really is 
you know uh that was always a a major problem in our marriage 
what i have always identified is i am basically good with money 
it i do n't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it 
i 
right 
think that comes from never having enough 
you know i 'm always afraid of i 'm going to need some and where will it be 
right 
oh yeah 
so um no 
i i 've i 've finally worked myself into a spot where i can budget 
when i when i was first divorced i had um i sat down and budgeted 
and i had outgo that was wha- much higher than what i had coming in 
yes 
i think uh that is a tough uh 
we all 
seems to th- seems to be that way 
i tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me 
and and so now that i 've gotten you know i lost the house now that i 've gotten past that i can sit down and say okay 
yeah 
this is the reality 
this is how much money i have each month 
the scary thing is as far as long term i do n't have anything 
i do n't know if you have an ira or uh you know 
and i 've got two girls also 
and i have n't saved anything for their college 
and 
yeah 
that 's you need to do that i 'll i 'll i 'll give you a hint 
i do n't know if you 're a ta- a radio talk uh person listener 
do you listen to radio talk shows 
sometimes i have 
listen to bruce williams uh for financial advice 
um-hum 
he 's on oh 
i do n't know what he 's going to be in austin 
he 's on five seventy here 
inter- oh 
he 's nationally famous 
he 's a college graduate type guy 
he 's been in all 
he 's an entrepreneur 
and he gives very practical financial advice about cars very you know not not nothing college level basic stuff 
his name is bruce williams 
he 's on national radio 
uh i do n't know what it would be down there 
you might want to 
whatever your radio talk shows are down there he 's on that channel 
it 's uh it 's five seventy up here 
well i 'll check that out 
uh-huh 
and i 'd listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when i 'm doing chores 
and uh he gives a wealth of information very practical stuff 
you 've learned a lot 
a- and he will help you avoid a lot of little things uh financially 
well that 's that 's good to know how 
he yeah 
there there 's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget 
and i i 'm not expert again because i do n't really do it monthly 
um-hum 
well you must have done something 
you 're you 're helping your children in school 
and you 're you know 
right 
i did start a college fund 
i 'm not uh i have one again at ut down there now her first year 
uh-hum 
and she 's almost gone through her whole college fund you know 
uh-hum excuse me jim 
could you hold on 
i have someone at the door 
sure go ahead 
i 'll be right back 
sure 
thank you 
i think we might have just screwed up the computer 
but we 'll find out 
oh no 
yeah 
right 
they give us ten minutes uh 
oh 
uh the only advice i give you on college would be there 's a lot of scholarship money out there 
my daughter got a little bit not much only first year 
she got about two thousand dollars worth 
and you ought to as your daughters approach the college age uh start finding out about the scholarship money because there is a lot of money out there 
and uh 
and and how did your daughter get scholarship money on 
uh band 
she got you know five hundred dollars at a at a clip through bands through leadership 
uh there 's all kinds of civic organ- organizations that will give you you know one shot money 
uh you get a president 's award if you 're you 're in in high school doing cer- 
this up area in arlington uh 
there 's a lot of 
and of course you if you you score high on the sat you can get you know two thousand a year you know or more 
um-hum 
wow 
you can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades 
she she did very well in school 
and uh but she only got first year money 
she got about two thousand dollars 
it was only five hundred dollars at a clip from this organization 
uh-hum 
we called 
there were there were two or three people 
there was some little civic organization in dallas that gave money away 
and only two or three people applied 
she applied and got five hundred dollars from that 
wow 
so look into that bit 
oh i 'm definitely going to be uh actively looking into that 
the year that they graduate you know before though you know while they 're graduating there 's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything 
and they do n't even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money 
um-hum 
uh of course you have to have some sort of record in high school uh of of achievement and everything 
but sometimes it 's just uh 
like our band gave money away 
we 're a band booster club 
we gave we give uh two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids uh who we think were worthy you know 
so there 's money out there 
well that 's great to know 
yeah 
that 's good 
go ahead 
you can talk 
i i do n't want to i want to chew up the whole line here 
oh well you 're doing you 're doing just fine 
and and uh actually i when i talk i usually like to ask a lot of questions 
i was wondering what you do at ti 
oh i 'm an engineer 
i 'm uh in fact i 'm working the night uh because of the cutbacks and everything 
uh my job 
there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved 
and so they put me on nights 
i i call this my recession job 
oh goodness 
and i 'm working nights just kind of covering uh shutdown equipment and everything and just being available here 
um-hum 
um-hum 
i do n't mind 
uh it beats being laid off and everything 
and uh you you got to be a little flexible 
oh absolutely 
yeah 
uh in my old age i 'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school 
and then i 'd like to teach maybe mathematics or something 
i 'm trying to study for that now 
oh i hope you can do that 
right uh 
what what i did is 
i was approached 
and and i 've 
i went to ti just right at the time that uh my marriage was ending 
i had been a a stay at home mom 
and and i i was very fortunate in starting 
um-hum 
and i really enjoyed it while i was at ti 
but you know the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening 
and i had less than five years 
and also i wanted to make a little bit more money 
so i decided i 'd like to go out and try sales 
oh yeah 
and uh i 'm i 'm out trying to sell telephone systems to businesses 
right 
and the potential there is fantastic 
oh sure 
the reality of it is it 's tough 
well it 's tough right now for everybody 
exactly 
up here in the dallas metroplex it 's awful 
hey i 've got another clue for you for college 
um-hum 
another clue for you for college money 
okay 
go to work for ut 
uh we have a friend who works who is a secretary for tcu you know up here 
yes 
they give you scholarship a hundred percent if you 're if you work for tcu 
they do 
yes 
so check that one out you know 
i 'm going to check that 
i 've got i 've got two friends that work at at ut 
i did n't know that at all 
ask them about it 
call them 
definitely i will 
and because it 's full full scholarship 
now it 's uh not room and board 
uh-huh 
but it 's tuition full tuition paid if your parent works at tcu 
well that sounds fantastic 
and her her her uh mother went over there just for that 
okay 
so uh what do you think about it 
well um i guess i i 'm more concerned about public safety than i am about the um the concern for the private uh the idea of preserving privacy for the individual um 
privacy 
right 
because i can n't really see why anyone um who has nothing to hide would object 
well there is always the uh the possibility even remote as it is of uh of mistaken uh of 
that 's of course that is certainly true 
yeah 
yeah 
and see that bothers me 
i 'm i 'm a i mean i 'm i 'm very much for drug testing 
um-hum 
uh i really am 
i mean i 'm going i 'm going to take the negative side just for a second just to do it 
sure 
um see i have to take uh medication for a uh for for kidney transplant 
uh-huh 
and i 'm going to be taking that the rest of my life 
now you 
sure 
i do n't know how that 's going to affect uh 
if you had to have a drug test 
right 
yeah 
i mean i have n't had one yet 
um ti 
i work for texas instruments and and uh we you know we do have the random drug testing 
um-hum 
um-hum 
but i 've missed it so far 
but i mean it in the back of my mind it always bothers me 
and what happens if it you know if it if they catch it 
they think that i 'm you know i 'm on drugs 
and they send me and and have me uh you know go through this this thing you know 
checked out or whatever 
yeah 
i but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that um 
i agree that that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test 
but i would think that um that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that 
for example that one uh positive would not be uh accepted as an automatic um reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive uh dismissal or treatment or whatever but that that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps uh one or two more stages where further tests could be ta- uh done 
right 
um-hum 
because um there are there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with with uh false positives for certain kind of drugs 
on the other hand um i think there 's certainly some professions that ought to be tested because of the of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in uh industries well the transportation industry for spe- uh you know specifically 
oh yeah 
um-hum 
no yeah 
but um in many many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it 's not even going to effect anybody but his uh you know himself and his own family perhaps um depending on the kind of drug he might be on 
right 
but um and eventually that 's going to show up anyway in the way he works and so on 
um-hum 
but there 's so many things that it would make a difference 
i guess i i uh i would not want to have anyone in my family uh victimized by someone who you know a a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that who um you know had n't been tested 
right 
well i you know i 'm like i said i 'm i 'm very much pro testing um 
and and this is why 
yeah 
uh number one is i i 'm i 'm kind of 
i know this sounds like a slogan for the government 
but i you know we are in a war against drugs 
yeah 
i mean it 's it 's horrible 
sure 
i mean you do n't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and it takes some drastic steps at this point 
and i think personally the drastic step has to be that um that you can n't work if you continue taking drugs 
yeah 
i mean it 's as simple as that 
i mean make it so well make it uh ma- not necessarily difficult 
make it difficult enough 
but make it so that it 's not glamorous 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean it 's glamorous taking drugs 
or at least it seems that way 
yeah 
according to what you you hear 
yeah 
the people who um have serious problems i mean 
we have um 
really i guess we 're kind of lucky 
we really only know of one um young man who uh who 's a fam- 
they go to our church 
um-hum 
and it 's the son and so on 
and he was friends with my children um 
and he 's really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up um ha- having been involved with drugs 
but i know of a number of other people who have you know gotten all messed up 
um-hum 
most of these are young people 
i work in the education system 
and so i have a little more contact with that 
but um the effect that it 's had on this young man 's life is so dramatic that it 's heartbreaking and he may never really be a productive member of society 
um-hum 
but sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are are almost uncontrollable 
i mean he he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that you know he he 's not sure if he 's going try to commit suicide or not 
hum 
i mean he 's you know he 's so messed up 
right 
and um this was a nice sweet young man who teenager you know 
and he 's now a young man about twenty i guess who um just got really down the wrong path 
right 
and uh you know i do n't know that that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing 
but seeing what drugs did to him makes me see makes me realize what it could do to people you know in the work force as well 
um-hum 
um it 's horrible 
well then 
let 's let 's answer the second half of the question 
what limits ought to be put on it do you think 
well the limits uh uh would i think have to do with what i 'd alluded to before that there needs to be a further um that that one positive on a drug test would not constitute uh dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might uh have set up for those who genuinely have a problem 
um-hum 
um-hum 
in other words there needs to be um more than 
treatment before for dismissal type thing 
pard- 
yes 
right 
um-hum 
there needs to be more than one test 
and there needs to be some some measure of uh certainty before anything drastic happens 
um-hum 
there are lots of things that are involved there um such as perhaps insurance uh you know denial of insurance for someone um 
and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this um that would that you know 
it would be unfair 
and people who are on medication for example or um e- even people who might be of the gay community 
and i 'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society 
but um i think that there does n't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination because it makes a bigger problem um 
right 
so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some ground you know some rules that protect 
um-hum 
i 'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested 
i really do n't see why 
personally i think that 's what i was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested 
and yeah 
yeah 
i do n't i do n't know why it would be you know um bad to test just every- 
and it may be you know 
it 's not feasible to do everyone 
but certainly random testing the fact that people know that that they 
that it could happen 
yeah 
um-hum 
would be some measure of protection 
but the bottom line is that that if if you 're going to stay clean and straight then um you 're you 're going to do that because you want to 
right 
really 
well there 's yeah there there 's going to be some measure of incentive uh reward or whatever 
but the reward u- ultimately comes down to what you want 
yeah 
so i i 've got to agree with that 
so um 
no that 's very true 
hum 
well it sounds like we agree anyway 
yeah 
i think so 
i think we i think we did pretty good 
yeah 
well all right 
well uh i guess that 's about it 
i guess if that 's all we 've done 
and i guess we 've talked long enough 
all right 
it was nice talking to you 
it was it was talk nice talking to you too 
okay 
bye-bye 
all right 
bye-bye 
so do you have any hobbies 
well right at the present time nothing real special 
i kind of like gardening 
and i 'm kind of into camping and you know vacationing that sort of thing 
yeah uh 
i do n't have any real serious 
i 'm an avid gardener um 
oh okay 
i think you 're 
um i consider that a hobby 
i do n't know 
they were like suggesting like handcraft things which 
um-hum 
i guess that 's a really true true hobby 
i- i- i think anything that you enjoy 
yeah 
yeah 
um it does n't really have to matter 
i mean it could be working on cars could be your hobby really 
well 
yeah 
i kind of enjoy doing that a little bit too 
no 
i- i guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation 
well did i yeah 
well i do n't know 
i told my husband i said you go out some to work on the car 
it 's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong 
i says you go pay to have someone do it 
then yeah 
because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something 
i guess as far north as you are if you like gardening you 've still got a couple months to go have n't you 
oh yeah 
um well right now we um start our seeds inside 
uh-huh 
oh yeah 
that 's right 
you would 
yeah 
we 'll start them inside 
and uh 
in cold frames or whatever the 
yeah 
well we usually start them right in the house 
um-hum 
my sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck 
and and the wi- a wind storm come and knock it down 
huh 
but she 's had really good luck 
i mean it 
next month 
well actually it if you if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of may 
you can leave them outside 
uh-huh 
you might put them in the ground just the first week of june but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of may 
yeah 
yeah 
i 've i 've lived in in texas and new mexico most of my life 
but i did once 
i spent one winter in north dakota 
oh 
and i- i remember that it was on into may before it really started warming up 
and uh 
yeah 
well well we live we live really close to lake champlain which is in the champlain valley 
oh yeah 
so we 're a little we 're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts 
so 
okay 
because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit 
yeah 
yeah 
we are a little lucky 
well my brother lives ten miles from here 
you 're at 
and he gets frost 
and his crop gets killed 
yeah 
you 're right across the uh lake from what plattsburgh 
yep 
from plattsburgh air force base 
oh yeah 
yeah 
but um 
yeah 
i had i had a cousin that was stationed there plattsburgh for a while 
he he remembers lots of snow 
yeah 
plattsburgh 's kind of a 
it 's uh it 's uh depressed economically 
oh really oh 
when you go across the lake um 
i do n't know why we have so much going for us 
i really do n't 
i 'm just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at digital 
and they 've never had well they 've had layoffs recently 
but when we got hired here no no never any layoffs never never 
yeah 
and now we 're looking at serious 
i- i mean i 'm a technician 
yeah 
when they start getting rid of technicians 
yeah 
well i 'm i 'm working for ti texas instruments down here 
well i interviewed with them 
oh yeah 
but i did n't want to go to texas 
oh 
even though my um mother 's people are from georgia 
oh 
yeah 
yeah 
well i guess we have to get back to hobbies since 
yeah 
we 're getting to where straying i guess 
stick on the subject 
yeah 
well interesting thing that i do is with gardening uh 
my sister grows flowers that you can dry 
um-hum 
and you can make fl- uh dried flower arrangements 
and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun 
and we made some really nice christmas wreaths with uh dried red flowers and dried white flowers and uh eucalyptus 
hum yeah 
you you know what eucalyptus is 
it 's 
yeah 
yeah 
the they s- uh it 's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries 
yeah 
it 's got a s- 
it 's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it 
but 
yeah 
at first i 'm like oh how why do people like this 
but it it is kind of a nice smell after a while 
people put them in 
yeah 
i did n't realize what it was for a while 
i 'd walk into a room where some of that 
and i 'd wonder what is that you know 
and then one day i- i realized that it was eucalyptus 
yeah 
it 's it 's it 's like a fad thing 
i- i do n't know 
it 's i 've never heard of it 
in the last five years i 've used so much of it that 
yes yeah 
i hate 
that 's the stuff that koala bears eat in australia or something 
to yeah 
it is 
maybe that 's why they 're so slow 
i guess they 're stoned on the stuff or something 
yeah 
it it looks really po- potent stuff 
yeah 
but uh it 's yeah i think it 's the greatest stuff in the world though 
it 's jeez 
they i make all kinds of things with it 
we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers 
i- i almost want to start a business doing it 
but i do n't i i 'm so uh timid when it comes to starting a business 
yeah 
that 's that 's a big step 
yeah 
yeah 
it is especially with the being in on the creative as- aspect on the crafty end 
yeah uh 
you know after a while you make some stuff 
then you start looking at it 
go boy this this is kind of ugly 
but i know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby 
um he does it believe it or not i would n't imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife 
because he 's a seasonal worker 
he works in the construction 
and up here it 's almost a pattern 
i mean you see your fathers do it 
then their sons do it 
what they do is they work construction 
um hum yeah 
then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter 
and uh this guy was going nuts 
and his uh son built him a garage and got him some uh oh i do n't know what the equipment 's called but planes and things and s- set him up 
um-hum 
shapes and planes and routers 
and h- he makes all kinds of furniture for um his kids 
and he makes uh uh like little kids furniture 
he gets right into it 
and uh 
there was a program on tv down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little little companies of one and two guys you know up there 
espec- this particular one i think was in maine and new hampshire where out in the just kind of out in these little towns they 'd be in 
they may be the same kind of people you 're talking about 
you know they 've they 've got twelve weeks to do something 
and they they 're making furniture and just you know things like that during the winter 
and then they go off and do other things during the summer 
yeah 
it 's a it 's a really good thing yeah because it 's keeping him sane 
so yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
and plus it 's keeping his marriage 
yeah 
so and and plus he 's getting on in his years now 
he 's he 's not that old 
but he 's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost to to do something like that 
yeah 
and uh it 's really it 's it 's uh hard work 
i could n't imagine taking lumber raw lumber and trying to make something out of it 
he d- he dowels everything 
that would be really t- you know 
like say the 
oh man 
yeah 
and it 's all got to line up 
and uh i do n't think he goofs too much 
i do n't to see too much scrap around 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's that 's something 
now our temperatures down here we 're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties and uh so and uh so as far as you know planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight i just got through i was planting some some trees out back tonight 
god i 'm envious 
and uh this is uh it 's really nice out tonight 
is it going to be is it going to be really dry 
almost hated to come in 
it are you pl- are no 
i always plant trees in the fall 
i do n't know why 
so the the cold weather can kill them but i guess 
yeah 
these were uh trees that that wintered 
i d- do n't know where they came from 
they come out of nurseries mostly in missouri and places like that 
and they come down here 
and they 'll sit in the nurseries here 
and they 'll go ahead and and uh leaf out 
so what i 'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that 's or trees that are already leafed out 
oh that 's good 
i guess they they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall um 
yeah 
mostly i think in a place where it 's really cold they do it in the fall 
let them winter yeah through the fall 
yeah 
but uh down here well it 's done both ways 
it it just kind of depends on what you 're what you 're planting 
but uh all the shrubs and 
yeah 
and uh when you have time to do it 
yeah 
my sister does uh flower gardens 
she gets right into it 
uh-huh 
she spends lots of money on them 
and i guess a lot of people do do do that 
they landscape their whole house with flower gardens 
yeah 
she 's got like just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch ba- uh tree bark all over her lawn 
yeah 
flowers during the summer down here the the normal kind of flowers there 's very few of them that 'll really do well 
everything does real well here in the spring until about oh first part of june 
and then the real the heat sets in 
it gets it 
and june july august are you know 
most of the those kind of plants just are just barely staying alive let alone make flowers 
do you have a lot of shade trees around your house 
or is it 
uh we 're in a relatively new area 
we 're kind of out of uh the natural tree area 
we 're kind of up on a on a higher on a slope 
so you do n't have a lot of tree coverage 
so we do n't have 
where we are right now there are very few trees 
because goi- going to make 
this was this was this was pasture land 
but down the down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are look like jungles you know 
they 're really 
yeah 
see um wh- uh where my uh well my grandmother passed away but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees 
um-hum 
and they just shade everything 
now where is this 
uh it 's in georgia 
in georgia 
yeah 
yeah 
it 's yeah it 's right outside of macon 
and and it 's just a 
i like the way that i like the way that idea of the south is 
but when i think of texas i think of nothing but no trees and just grass 
well i tell you what 
now see east texas 
there 's two parts of texas east texas and north texas 
atlanta and dallas are almost identical in every way weather and everything 
yeah 
the two cities are very very identical 
so if you were familiar with atlanta uh 
so it 's that dry heat 
uh well no 
it 's it 's uh not dry at all 
it it 's humid 
well where is it 
is it hous- was n't it houston 's humid 
hou- houston is awful 
yeah 
houston is really humid 
now 
it 's humid 
there we go 
okay 
well uh what do you think about taxes 
do you think we 're paying too much 
yes and no 
income tax no 
i uh i look at it this way uh you 've got to pay for the privilege of living here 
um-hum 
but uh being a uh a rec vehicle owner 
well in fact i live in a motor home 
i 'm a full what they call a full timer 
and uh it burns gas like crazy 
i only get seven miles to the gallon 
i really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes 
and they call it uh uh 
what 's the word they use 
anyway a lux- a luxury tax 
yeah 
they ga- add it on on to tires and gasoline cigarettes liquor 
and it does n't bother me any because i 've quit drinking 
and i quit smoking 
so that does n't bother me 
but i do n't think it 's fair 
yeah 
it 's it 's too um um it 's attacking just certain people 
how true 
and even with the gasoline tax 
yeah 
well gasoline especially in this part of the country we all use it all the time you know 
it 's that 's not what i would consider a luxury 
no 
uh fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury 
but it 's a necessity today 
and uh as hard as they try to get these public transit things going i have never seen nor heard of one that uh re- really got off the ground or that accomplish what they set out to accom- to accomplish 
yeah 
what are your feelings on it 
well um i- i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we 're getting for it and how it 's being managed and so forth 
i mean i- i think there could be a better system 
and we would get more for our money 
it 's totally out of our hands 
so we do n't we can n't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes 
and and 
yeah 
that that 's that 's so true 
i mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on election day 
but not really 
no 
you do n't 
look what happened on the last presidential election 
read my lips 
and what happened they turned around and double crossed us 
yeah 
so uh i mean you you can n't believe what you what you hear 
well i think too 
one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by congress and that do n't seem to have any validity at all 
i mean they 're always far out 
and uh you know they 're studying some obscure uh bug you know in some other part of the world or some such thing 
oh 
uh yes 
and and our tax money pays for those things 
and i think that 's wrong 
i 
i agree 
and and uh uh i also think we extend too much help to other uh countries 
we need enough help here in this country 
that 's right 
they 're still people starving people here 
why should we help starving people somewhere else 
yeah 
and i think here lately they 've been saying quite often and maybe somebody 's coming to realize that we 're the nation in trouble 
abs- absolutely 
now i can n't wait for uh 
i- i could just picture wha- what 's going to happen here in the not to distant future 
we keep hearing well we 're going to receive uh eight billion dollars from japan for the uh uh uh the uh uh the the the big war over there in the mideast 
the war 
um-hum 
and uh so many billions of dollars here and there and everything 
and uh the next thing you know we 'll be t- turning around just like we did to poland 
and say well just forget it 
yeah 
and i think that 's a mistake 
oh definitely 
somewhere somewhere you know we have to realize that we can n't just keep giving it away 
well another thing now they they keep the decontrolling different things 
first it was the airlines then it was banks and and uh um savings association and what not 
we know what trouble they got into 
exactly 
and the same with the airlines back in the days when they were uh controlled and and uh uh transcontinental or u- u- u- u- interstate uh trucking 
i mean as soon as the uh the federal government gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket 
yeah 
uh prices went uh sky high 
you know in the in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive 
and they cut each others throats until they 're they 're reach the point where they 're cutting their own throat 
and uh well of course that 's getting away from taxes is n't it 
th- that 's government controlled 
but um 
well i- i think another thing too that um i 've had a little contacted with uh 
in regard to taxes let 's say that um you have something that the irs disagrees with or you know says hey we 're not going to allow that 
well i think they 're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you you will not only pay back that that you wrote off 
but you will at least double that amount 
and 
oh by the time you get through with the uh the penalties 
yes 
and that 's to me there 's something wrong there you know 
yeah 
i mean i can see paying the interest and some small penalty 
but they really stick it to you big time 
uh i agree 
i think the irs is uh just too powerful 
there should be some sort of a control on it 
and they should be a little more humane 
um-hum 
absolutely 
uh the um well typical bureaucratic i guess uh that 's that 's one of my pet peeves 
i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the uh the budget 
um-hum 
very simple 
give uh uh uh government employees the average number of of uh holidays as the uh uh the private industry 
yeah 
i mean you think about it now 
they they get about sixteen holidays a year 
that 's a lot 
it sure is 
and i think here at ti we get what is it nine or ten 
well i have n't counted 
i- i would have guessed eight even 
but you might be right 
i do n't have any idea 
well i remember uh 
thinking i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average 
maybe even a little more a day or so more than the average 
yeah 
but uh government is ridiculous 
wow 
just think of the money they could save 
i mean they 're they 're paying out this money anyway 
yeah 
why not get the work out of the people 
yeah 
and well anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes 
but uh as far as income tax is concerned i can n't complain too much about it 
um i 'm single 
i have no uh dependents or anything 
my children are all grown 
and they 're out worrying about their own income taxes 
yeah 
well i- i have another thing that i thought about too um for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is 
and you know we 're not typically talking about big dollars 
but here you feel like you 've you 've done something good 
you 've you 've earned your interest 
and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it 
so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much 
um very true 
that 's 
you know it 's kind of a vicious circle there 
and then they tell you to uh well invest it in uh is it ira 's or something 
and and w- when you turn when you turn sixty five why then you pay the tax on it 
and then they took that away as far as being 
and the tax is a lot less 
yeah 
but in the mean time you u- used them you 've got your money tide up in a low relatively low interest uh bearing investment 
i mean it 's not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today 
huh-uh 
um me i 'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it 
well you can come over to my house and spend it 
well you well do you do you need some help spending yours 
i wish i had some to spend 
no 
no 
i do n't i just do n't have any 
oh oh uh-huh 
well that 's my problem too 
i 'm i 'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that 's going to get paid 
yeah 
that 's the way it goes 
well i guess we probably talked just about long enough 
um-hum 
yeah 
uh let me ask you something 
did you get a catalog or something from these people 
yes 
yet you did 
uh-huh 
i 've everybody i 've talked to has received one 
and i have n't gotten mine 
i do n't know 
um well anyway ellen it was nice talking to you 
you too 
and uh -til next time 
okay 
bye-bye 
good-bye 
okay 
well i have n't uh you know 
when the war was on i watched um cnn and um nightline pretty regularly and read the paper and all 
uh-huh 
but when uh lately like the last week or two i guess with easter and spring break with the kids i um i had n't been thinking much about the middle east and what 's going on over there 
have you been keeping up 
uh well uh just really the last couple of days since this uh the un debate or whatever you want to call it that uh voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire 
i guess you know the thing really is n't over 
uh-huh 
they uh they had uh kind of uh i do n't know if you call it stand down or whatever 
but anyway they stopped and wait to see if iraq would accept a a permanent cease fire situation though 
as i understand it from the iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the un uh uh had uh set up you know 
the iraqis are probably not going to go for at all unless they 're just absolutely forced to 
uh 
hum 
so i guess from what i understand the thing could just they could just t- they could take off at any moment without uh you know any uh-huh you know any local um you know congressional effort or anything else because you know it 's not really settled yet 
start it 
there 's no official document signed or anything 
not yet 
not yet at all 
well i um when the when the crisis began last august i began to think 
well i i um could n't remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all 
so i got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history 
uh-huh 
and it it was really 
what i felt was kind of cynical because it there just has n't been any peace over there ever 
no 
in thousands of years of history 
yeah 
i do n't know why they expect it 's going to start this week you know 
yeah 
that 's right 
and it just it 's just not people they 
and it 's not uh you know 
there is n't any real arab coalition because they do fight among themselves and they fight with each other and they have such hatred for uh israel and 
uh-huh 
yeah 
the uh the thing that 's kind of interesting uh about this 
my sons in the air force 
oh yes 
and uh he came within about a quarter of an inch of going uh to saudi 
he ended up in korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in lubbock 
hum oh no 
so he ended up going to korea 
but his buddies ended up going to saudi 
well he 's still in korea 
and his buddies are home now 
he he almost wishes that that he could have gone home 
he and got it over with 
yeah 
well i just there 's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace 
uh-huh 
and um with 
and that i 'm afraid that we would have to stay 
yeah 
the thing uh the other thing too when this all started if you you know if you did much reading on the thing you know kuwait the country of kuwait was just you know somebody 's uh 
you know you go back to world war i when the uh ottoman empire broke up and the british and the french and the eng- yeah the british and the french mostly decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it persia and part of it uh iraq and part of it something else you know 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and they they split things along um geographical lines 
but they did n't take any kind of consideration into uh social or cultural things at all 
right 
so the country of uh of kuwait really does n't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an accepted place you know it 's like any other country you know for whatever reason it 's it 's actually there 
yeah 
well iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty two 
so you know it was n't like something that just suddenly popped up 
yes 
and it 's just that this was an excuse you know to to make some noise 
now something that i read in the paper the other day that i thought was kind of interesting was that the arab uh uh their version or vision or whatever the united states now is somewhat changed in that we won you know 
yes 
now now we are a uh you know a legitimate player in the game over there you know 
the we 
i do n't think we can really understand their attitude because their culture 's just so much different 
right 
but uh uh we are now a legitimate player in the in the in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we you know we defeated you know 
iran could n't do it in seven years 
and we went in and did in in seven days what iran could n't do in seven years you know 
right 
so that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit 
right 
it makes us more legitimate 
so now what they 're saying is that well since we won whatever we say goes because it 's a a kind of a a might makes right sort of attitude about it 
and you know we 've got the power yeah which is why for centuries you know hundreds of years the british and the the french had so much influence in there 
yeah 
because they 'd go in and they 'd win something 
right 
and then and then they could call the shots for the next you know period of time until the next strong man came up and you know and caused problems 
right 
well i just uh i 'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go in and call the shots like you say 
so yeah 
yeah 
an- and i just would prefer that 
i mean sometimes we 've said let 's keep we 're not interested in what other countries do 
uh-huh 
and then other times we jump in and do things 
and while i 'm really glad that they uh 
i 
it was important to de- demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments 
yeah 
i do n't ho- i 'd i hope we do n't try to keep uh in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to stay over there because we just do n't want to send our people there and make them stay 
yeah yeah 
that 's that 's the uh that 's that 's the big thing you know 
we still got a little bit of the old you know vietnam um problem in you know in the back of our minds 
we we got this 
yeah 
we 're we 're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out 
vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung 
yeah 
uh this thing 
they they gave the guys uh the power and the material and the told them to go do it 
and they did it you know got in and got out 
yeah 
i 'm not sure 
the the big fuss that we 're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the kurds because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands 
and yeah 
and whether the the united nations i do n't think the us will do it on their own but whether the united nations comes around and says hey wait a minute 
we know this thing is n't uh all that much over 
we 've got to go back in there and and be sure that this large population is n't just wiped out which is seems to be exactly what 's happening right at the moment 
uh-huh 
i noticed that 
but uh you know 
well i do n't think there 's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they 
oh well no 
no 
there there never will be 
yeah 
i mean uh uh the only way that you 're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them you know 
until we make a decision to do that there wo n't be peace 
but i do n't think we want to make that decision either 
history uh-huh no 
so that 's that 's a little rough you know 
we 're not we 're not quite up to that sort of thing 
no 
so 
well i guess i better go 
i have a repairman just came for my refrigerator 
yeah oh 
oh well that 's that 's fun 
but 
yes 
well i enjoyed the topic 
i hope you ha- have a good day 
you too 
okay 
bye-bye 
bye bye 
what type of lawn and garden work do you do 
well i do it all 
i see 
do you have a garden 
uh yes 
i i try to grow uh uh a vegetable garden 
and 
we do the same thing 
it 's i just have a small plot it 's like ten feet by five feet 
yeah 
i have two plots 
one 's ten by ten 
and one 's like fifteen by four 
i see 
it 's a long skinny one 
and 
yeah 
you do a lot more area than i do 
i 've 
all the rest of my yard backyard is uh you know pool and decking 
it 's all the dirt i have left in my backyard 
oh i see 
yeah 
i see 
well i enj- i enjoy fiddling around 
it 's cheap entertainment 
right 
right 
yeah 
it 's nice to get out in the open air 
it is 
uh-huh 
and especially when the weather 's not too hot or not raining or whatever 
that 's right 
yeah 
but uh sometimes i i said i sometimes i wish i had more space you know 
i enjoy 
excuse me go ahead 
uh-huh 
i grow a lot of things a lot of food 
uh-huh 
and sometimes i i want to plant something there 's not enough room to plant it and some of those things like uh you know the things that vine like uh cucumbers or uh squash or something like that plant one of those 
that 's right 
that 's right 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
takes a lot of room 
and it takes up your whole space 
it sure does 
i made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe 
my goodness what a mistake that was 
oh yeah 
th- yeah 
they they just run all over the place do n't they 
they do 
well it was very good 
it just takes up you know like you say a lot of your garden area 
right 
right 
it 's the first and only time i 've done that 
we do n't do anything exotic 
we just do oh tomatoes bell peppers radishes and turnips i mean not turnips carrots beets and things like that 
see i the basics 
uh right 
uh-huh yeah 
that 's what we do too 
my wife used to plant a few snow peas 
i do n't really care for snow peas 
well she just plants a few for herself 
right 
peas i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago 
yeah 
did you really 
the first one they started them indoors this time 
i read it 
oh i see 
and so i 
okay 
we normally do n't start anything indoors 
we 
yeah 
just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground 
i uh i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that 
probably so 
yeah 
you can get a head start on it 
but uh sure is a heck of a lot of work 
i guess it it might would 
because you got to watch them every day and keep them watered 
yeah 
um-hum 
and i i do n't think i 'll do it again 
yeah well it will make it will make them taste better i 'm sure 
oh yeah 
yeah 
i enjoy it 
i come home from work 
and i usually say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and the inspect it 
sure 
you got to inspect it 
yeah 
and the kids want to swing 
sure 
and i push them on swing 
sure 
and and i wal- i mow my own lawn 
yeah 
and and i do i do n't have a sprinkler system 
i i do n't enjoy watering 
no 
especially 
i 
this is the first home we 've lived in we 've had a sprinkler system 
oh how 
and boy it is really nice 
oh 
it sure beats dragging hoses around 
yeah 
you can have it come on just early in the morning and and off by the you know by the time you 're up and about 
that 's right 
uh-hum that 's right 
it 's really nice 
and yeah 
i i usually get it started for my wife and i and she moves it around every other day 
uh-huh 
yeah i 'll have to admit i do n't i do my own yard 
i i really do n't enjoy doing that 
i enjoy having a nice looking yard 
uh-huh 
i just do n't enjoy the work that it takes to get it done 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months you know until i retired 
yeah uh-huh 
now i i 've lost my excuse for that so i 'd have 
last last couple of years i 've done it myself 
yeah 
sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of 
uh-huh 
yeah 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
the loop but um but they want too much money 
it is kind of expensive 
it is 
yeah 
of course the chemicals themselves when you buy them they 're expensive too 
right 
right 
but it 's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself 
that 's right 
if i have a problem discipline you know i think 
now boy i really need to get out you know and apply something you know 
and i screw around and do n't do it or wait too long or something 
right 
and the weed come up 
that 's right 
and all of a sudden you 've got to do something else 
that 's right 
i 'm i 'm kind of bad about that 
yeah 
i enjoyed having a lawn service 
but now i have the time 
and i really can n't i really don- you know do n't want to spend the money for it 
yeah yeah well if you enjoy it too you know you you can get out in the morning when before it gets hot and do it and and stuff when you only have 
yeah 
that 's true uh-huh that 's right 
i 'm not limited to just mowing it on saturday morning you know 
right 
i can do it on most any day of the week 
when the days start getting a little longer you know you can i can start doing it in the evening after work 
uh-huh 
uh-huh that 's right 
yeah when they when they switch to switch 
yeah 
when we get an hour more 
yeah 
when they rollback an hour 
that 's coming up here pretty soon 
is it this weekend 
i do n't know 
it 's pretty soon 
i really do n't know 
it just seems like i here it on the news the day before 
um-hum 
and uh i i think it 's coming up here soon 
yeah uh-huh i believe it is too 
yeah 
yeah 
we 
are you having any trouble with bugs in in your garden 
uh not a whole lot uh 
i i do n't use i i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust you know 
uh-huh 
i do n't really like to put a lot chemicals on it 
but then again i do n't want the bugs eating it upping either 
right 
right 
i i 
it seems like they come in spurts 
uh-huh 
one year i did n't put anything on 
and i did n't have any problems 
uh-huh 
next year i was planting some broccoli and and some of those they are called cabbage cabbage loppers or whatever 
uh-huh 
right 
uh-huh 
they were just covered with them 
yeah 
i mean i went up 
i did n't go out there for about three days you know because i and went up there one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
they devoured it that quickly 
absolutely 
they really go through it 
and they they have a you a good appetite 
they really do 
yeah 
and they would you know 
i i picked off like twenty of them 
and 
um-hum you know cut worms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too 
i 
go yeah 
boy they 'll strip 
so i got that uh what is that safer soap uh b t spray this year 
them uh-huh 
yes 
uh-huh uh-huh 
and i 've been watching them every day 
and i 've and i have n't seen any signs yet 
so if i see any signs i 'm going to spray them 
yeah 
and uh 
yeah i did something a little bit different this year that i have n't done before 
i 've got 
uh my garden is shaped that i can 
it 's kind like this uh box shape 
so i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box and put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure 
right 
and you know various other things raised it up 
well the good stuff 
huh right 
and i 'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i wo n't have oh i 'll have less of a bug problem 
any- at least they they 'll have a hard time crawling up the thing 
right 
yeah 
my backyard is uh is sloping 
so i built a box up you know had to build the one the low side up 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and uh i had sandy loam hauled in 
i had a dump truck come and dump it 
uh-huh 
on my driveway i guess that 's what they do 
and then i had to wheel barrow it in 
uh-huh yeah 
right 
but uh you know you can improve your own soil there but the texas soil is n't the greatest gardening soil 
uh-huh 
that 's right 
yeah you you have to work on 
you 
right 
really do 
then you know and you know if i i did n't want to wait five years for it to be good enough to grow 
you know 
uh-huh that 's right 
when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden 
so i had a good i had a lot of loam out there to start with 
i just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with 
uh-huh 
do you have do you have a rotor tiller 
it no 
i do n't 
i did it by hand 
small enough 
you have a 
just do it by hand 
uh-huh 
yeah 
it was n't too much of a job really 
yeah 
yeah 
like i say it 's just 
i 'd like to get one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
it 'd be handy 
with and it weighs twenty pounds or something like that 
yeah 
my neighbor across the street has one 
he always uses it to dethatch his lawn 
um-hum uh-huh 
i see him out there 
yeah 
and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it 
it might be handy 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah they 're pretty neat little 
i 've never seen one 
i have a friend who has one 
and and he lets me you know no problem borrowing if it 's just a hassle when you know to go up 
uh-huh 
oh yeah 
and it 's a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van and bring it home and check it back and just grab it you know if i just go to my garage and grab it 
yeah 
uh-huh 
right 
uh-huh yeah 
that would be neat 
sure 
that would be nice 
would we 've had a garden gosh for years and years and years of some size you know 
uh-huh 
i can n't remember a year when we did n't have one of some kind 
what have you got growing right now 
uh got 
uh tomatoes that are starting to bloom and uh i 've got carrots i mean yes i 've got a few carrots up 
uh-huh 
and i 've got some radishes up 
hm 
and as a matter of fact i 've already done a second row of radishes 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and uh the green onions are coming along 
okay 
snow 
what kind 
excuse me 
what kind of onions do you grow 
do you grow those those ten fifteen y 
yes 
i 've 
for the first time we planted them this year 
oh they they are the best 
uh-huh yeah 
yeah we tried to find them last year 
we screwed around and waited too long 
and i could n't find a nursery that had any of them left 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but we 've got some this year 
uh those 
snow peas are up 
and my wife does uh a small herb garden on the side 
i see 
and uh they 're up and doing fine 
yeah 
i uh 
those onions i think we we planted like twice as much this year because you know we got on- onions 
and they lasted from you know about when you harvest them about a month from now or so or six weeks from now until until like october 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
and uh we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just can n't compare 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's kind of a let down 
she made these onion rings that were so good 
oh i bet 
and and and uh you do n't realize how many dishes you put onions in that it 's an ingredient 
they were 
that 's right 
we use a lot 
we sure do 
and and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better 
um-hum yeah 
one nice thing with onions and and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have you know too many 
right 
right 
we froze a lot of peppers 
we let some turn red 
um-hum yeah 
uh-huh 
we did that too 
and some we do green 
and then my wife puts them on pizzas and and chops them up in recipes and things like that 
uh-huh 
sure 
makes uh makes a colorful salad too 
oh yeah 
put them in salad 
yeah 
yeah uh-huh 
you 're you 're making me hungry here 
we planted some uh yellow peppers this year 
we 've tried it before 
yeah oh 
and nope 
we have n't had much luck with it we 're going to try it again this year 
yellow peppers huh 
they have some little buds on them hopefully they 'll do something 
yeah 
sounds like you have a real good garden 
yeah 
we enjoy fooling around with it 
just let me see what i got 
i got the peas 
and i 've got some broccoli uh onions some some radishes and uh uh beets 
beets 
yeah 
we 've got some beets 
uh-huh 
uh and i planted potatoes too 
um-hum 
i 've never done potato 
we used to do it at home when i was a kid we had a huge garden 
oh the potato 
they were deli- they 're delicious 
but they 
you do n't get seem to get that much for the space 
um-hum uh-huh 
they they do 
it takes a yeah it does take some space 
some beets uh potatoes 
yeah 
and i 've got some tomatoes still growing in in containers 
uh-huh 
i see 
i got to wait for a place to to to free up 
uh-huh 
um our our kids love pickles 
and we all love pickles 
so we 're going to try to grow our own pickles this year 
uh-huh 
that will be neat 
yeah 
we 've got some good um um hybrid burpee uh pickler cucumbers 
uh-huh 
and we 're going to try to see if we can pickle our own 
and so because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store 
uh-huh yeah that will be neat 
yeah 
absolutely 
they 're expensive 
i know it 
i said why are they so expensive they 're just a bunch of little cucumbers you know 
i do n't know unless it labor intensive or something 
i really do n't know yeah yeah 
i guess 
but we 're going to try that and see how that works 
that 'd be interesting 
an experiment 
yeah 
i 'd like to try you know just try something new every year that i have n't tried before 
sure 
yeah 
and 
that 's interesting 
well 
well i 'll let you go it 's 
well what would you have at a dinner party 
well uh lately since i have children i 've cut down on having dinner parties 
uh-huh 
but when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time 
uh i have one recipe for uh a really good um type of a meatball 
it 's called burgundy meatballs 
and it 's made with r- red wine and 
oh gosh that sounds great 
um it 's it 's really good 
and you can make it ahead of time and then um make the sauce when you 're ready to um to serve it 
uh-huh 
that 's one of my favorite things to to serve 
well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or informal dinner party 
sure 
but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish 
oh really 
well i guess being from that part of the country 
because i mean crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish 
but you know i i would n't have to worry about satisfying my guest 
uh-huh 
but if it was a formal uh dinner party i would probably think of something else like um 
shrimp shrimp fettucini is real easy to um make and everything 
yeah 
and it 's usually well liked by people i guess 
i 'm just a seafood fan 
so i think on the lines 
well how do you make how do you you cook crawfish 
i in fact i just came back from the grocery store 
and being in texas we do n't have too many you know people that that eat crawfish 
but they had live crawfish on sale 
oh yeah 
um you 're not supposed to i mean you 're not supposed to eat them dead 
i mean well you eat them dead 
um-hum 
but 
do n't buy them that way 
right 
because if if they 're dead for too long 
you can always tell whenever they 're cooked if they 've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out 
uh-huh 
and you 're not supposed to eat those because they 're the bad for you 
okay 
well i 'll remember that 
yeah 
so if you ever go in a restaurant and order crawfish 
i mean every once in a while you 'll see o- 
i mean it does n't happen very often because it 's just an accident 
but if the tail is straight on it then yeah do n't eat it 
uh-huh 
but um you just put some cajun well lots of pepper and you just boil them 
uh-huh 
and they 're absolutely wonderful 
but there 's uh they 're a pain to peel for some people 
once you get used to it they 're real easy 
but um you know if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot 
when you were um whe- when you serve it do you shell them and then serve them to 
i think for a dinner party 
i i do n't know 
it depends 
um-hum 
like if like my age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party no i they would shell their own 
sure 
you know we 'd just have crawfish and beer or something 
but um if it was more formal like if i was you know working environment then i would probably um sh- shell them or at least disconnect them from the head 
but there 's a there 's a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head 
so they do n't have see that ooh 
so um it it would just depend 
that 's the best part of the crawfish 
sucking the head 
but um i do n't know 
it just i- it just depended on what type it was i guess 
but you can buy uh the crawfish tails already peeled an- everything 
and usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um you know make a sauce with or something like that 
um-hum 
but you can go ahead and buy them cooked and shelled 
and they 're more expensive of course 
but 
does it taste a lot like shrimp 
um yeah 
it really does i like shrimp better 
uh-huh 
yeah 
just um but crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own 
it also depends on who 's cooking it and how much seasoning they use and stuff like that 
sure 
but um i think that 
and also to get totally off c- the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors doeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps 
yeah 
we have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time 
and 
that 's what i need 
yeah 
that 's what i wish i had 
but in our family i 'm the one who who cooks 
and i i really enjoy it 
it 's gotten a little more difficult with kids 
but i really do enjoy cooking 
and we um we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot 
uh-huh 
and before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and i 'd try to outdo him and then he 'd try to outdo me 
oh 
and we we 
was really a lot of fun 
i bet 
and 
that that got pretty competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe 
yeah 
it did 
and we we tried to be fancier or more courses than the other 
that 
or 
would be fun 
uh it was a lot of fun you know 
it something unique you know 
and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i do n't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh uh elegant theme or you know 
uh huh 
it was a lot of fun 
sometimes it might be the candlelight 
and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something 
that 's right 
well that 's you know that 's fun 
it was fun 
and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time uh just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying 
uh huh 
that sounds right i would i 'd take him up on that 
i 'm 
it does 
except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just to uh make sure that they did n't have to do it again 
um-hum maybe 
make hot dogs or some potato chips 
i that 's about how much i can cook you know 
i 'm i 'm doing a lot more cooking now then i used to 
or uh-huh 
but that 's only because my mom just started working 
so she 's tired when she comes home in the afternoon 
so i try to have things cooked for her 
but uh um i usually try to stay out of kitchen 
oh that 's nice 
i do n't know 
not one of my favorite hobbies 
it can it can be fun i if you have the time 
but you know a lot of times it 's too it 's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it 
but well um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she um every christmas and and easter 
whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce 
and it has 
i do n't know 
they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs 
and they are just absolutely delicious 
i do n't know what she calls them and 
i do n't i 'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol 
but 
um 
i do n't know 
i would i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around 
yeah 
it 's um it 's in the other room 
i do n't know if we have enough time for it 
oh 
it 's real easy 
one of the unique things in this like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um um what ever seasoning 
usually just light 
yeah 
seasonings like salt and pepper um and chopped up water chestnuts which is something different um 
oh 
that would be wonderful 
makes them a little bit crunchy 
you need to chop them up real fine 
yeah 
but um it makes them crunchy 
and that adds something new to it 
and then the sauce is just made with um bouillon cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour 
um-hum 
oh 
so it 's not a it 's not a thick rich type of a sauce 
it 's more of a 
when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um chinese food the kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies 
um-hum 
and it gives it a bit of a different consistency 
well um how long do you cook the meatballs 
the meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until they 're uh browned on all all sides 
uh huh 
and then drain off all the grease 
uh then what i usually do is i freeze them 
and then when you 're ready to serve them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it 
oh 
yeah 
probably you have to heat it up for a good oh 
if they 're frozen you know it may take a half hour for them to thaw out 
but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself 
let them simmer in the sauce itself 
hum 
that 's real good 
that sounds great 
especially i mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance 
right 
i mean like if if you are having a dinner party on wednesday night you could do it on a weekend 
and then freeze them 
sure 
that would be great 
i 'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because i hope to have lots of dinner parties because i like to 
i mean i 'm i 'm sure that i 'll be involved in a big company 
and i know that my future husband will be you know 
he 's going to be working for chevron in houston 
yeah uh-huh 
so he 's going to be 
um you know i 'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy 
yeah 
you 'll meet friends 
invite invite the boss over and and the friends at work 
oh yeah 
i have to impress the boss and clients because um i 'm in i 'm in public relations in school 
uh-huh 
so i 'm going to have you know my whole job 's going to be based on my clients an- stuff like that 
so i 'm going to have lots of dinner parties 
sure 
and have to take them out to eat 
and right now i am taking a class on etiquettcy 
and all the little bitty things that i did n't even know 
oh 
really 
i mean i thought for sure i 'd been raised properly 
but i 'd been doing a lot of things wrong i did n't know about 
but um so is there anything else 
well i- i think we 've we 've covered the subject 
i 've got some interesting information about crawfish 
i was in fact 
i was it 's good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for sale 
oh 
yes 
you need to try them 
oh they 're wonderful 
oh i will 
i 'm sure my husband will be surprised because we were talking about them the other day even before 
uh no 
i think that maybe the the automation people that are we 're discrete well are not discrete uh electronic devices 
oh okay 
oh 
oh and did he is he the one that got you connected with us 
uh-huh 
um hum okay 
it 's a lot of fun 
yeah 
you want to punch the button and go 
sure 
you ready 
yep 
okay 
well are you going to buy a car soon 
well it wo n't be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to re- retire 
and when we retire we 're going to buy us a you know a new one and and get rid of the two that we have right now 
and what are you going to buy 
i do i do n't know 
we 're either going to buy a pick up 
or we 're going to buy a van 
or we 're going to buy an economy car 
how do you like that 
well have you been listening to iaccoca 's arguments that uh that chrysler products are the only ones that that all have airbags 
yeah 
does that make a difference to you 
yeah 
it sure does 
i really would like to have something like that 
and i 'm hoping that by you know 
that 's like right now 
my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now 
but i keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because i 'm hoping they 'll get so many better features 
yeah 
like what 
well just like that air bag 
i think that thing is fantastic 
cause i 've seen some of the you know like the head on collision type things where they had it and people walk away from it 
yeah 
we had one here 
i guess it was about three weeks ago 
and the people walked away from the wreck with no scratches nothing you know a few bruises 
that 's 
nice did did you see the uh 
i do n't know if it was 20/20 last thursday or friday night on on seat belts 
um-hum 
did that scare you a little bit with the lady being thrown out and run over 
uh-huh 
you got it 
i i tell you what 
i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door 
that really sc- 
i guess i 
that that a little more than scared me 
that irritated me uh 
that 
because it if if it it surely did n't come as a surprise that that if the door came open the lady would fall out 
i mean and 
well you know what the average person 
would you ever have thought of that 
um no 
i mean now i- 
probably well 
you probably would not 
i 'm not 
the problem is i 'm i 'm really into cars 
and so it 's not a uh 
um for me it 's it 's a real it 's a real consideration um uh 
and and uh the 
but no 
i probably would n't have even though i 'm really quite into cars 
it 's it 's probably my main hobby 
right because you always think 
i mean i do n't know 
maybe you do n't 
but just like me i always think well you know these things must be safe 
but that 's just like 
i do n't know if you 've heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist 
yeah 
all these people were 
a- and it was on one of those kind of shows like 20/20 these people were like paralyzed 
uh-huh 
and because it threw them forward 
but they were hooked at the waist 
and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord then they were like paraplegics 
yeah 
yeah 
you know road and track had a had some articles on 
and particularly with with backseat uh with some where kids were were sitting in the backseat with seat belts on 
and they were thrown forward into the front seat 
and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to uh par- i mean to serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the the forced to go 
right 
so really if your sitting in the backseat you 're better off not to have your seatbelt on if it 's just a seatbelt 
yeah 
we have a van that uh just has seat belts in the back does n't have a shoulder harness i have an arrow star van 
well tell me about your van 
do you like it 
we really do 
uh it 's it 's a mini van 
we 've had it 
goodness in may will be five years 
and uh they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty 
and the transmission was replaced 
but they really are nifty um 
the mini van it 's 
actually we had a station wagon before 
and it 's a foot or two shorter than a 
we had a regular size station wagon and it really um 
um-hum 
we like it 
it the 
interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks 
huh the reason that we 're thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to florida and like i said i mean we 're not that old 
uh-huh 
but my husband works for the state 
and after a certain amount of years you can retire 
and when he retires i 'm retiring 
well as soon as i get my quarters in i 'm retiring period 
uh-huh 
that 's it 
yeah 
you know no more 
well but the 
did you did you go to florida in a van 
and so uh-huh 
and we wanted to travel 
well that was really nice traveling 
but you know i like to know more i mean hear about more people that have things like that you know 
yeah 
and see what they think of them 
the different kinds because i 've only ridden in the one 
yeah 
which what kind was it 
that 's it 
uh shoot 
i can n't even think of the name of it now 
what what was remarkable this van even with the 
we have two kids 
and we went to disney world uh actually i grew up in alabama 
uh-huh 
and i went to see my mother 
and then went on down to disney world 
and it got better than i think twenty two twenty three miles a gallon 
and this was with the air conditioner on and and you know four people with with luggage 
yeah 
and uh course this 
grant it 
that 's you know it 's been four years ago 
but it 's remarkable that the that the bigger vans uh they 're uh 
my boss just bought a a pick up truck 
and uh he only gets seventeen miles a gallon 
yeah 
but it it has a big engine 
and it it pulls a boat and stuff 
but it 's and it it 's got the seats 
that and the other thing that is interesting is it has uh rear air conditioning 
uh-huh 
and that that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates 
yeah 
well now this one that we went in 
it did 
baby what kind of van was that that we went to florida in 
a what 
a ford 
ford what 
you remember 
he was trying to think of what the name of it was 
well the big you know the big vans are all real nice 
this was a big one 
i mean it was a big one 
yeah 
oh those are yeah 
it had the it had the front and the back and you know it has the uh backseat let down into a double i mean a queen size bed and then it had the two swivels in the middle and then the two swivel chairs on the front and i mean it was fantastic 
yeah 
all right 
they 
and it got good gas mileage 
but i do n't know 
i do n't really i do n't 
i want something i can drive too you know 
uh well well the mini the 
and i was scared to drive that big van 
you 'd be surprised if if you drive a one of the the mini vans uh 
fact there all more or less alike the the uh chevrolet 
and uh well of course oldsmobile has got one 
and chryslers got one 
but they drive remarkably like cars 
well do you does yours have that this one had it where you know you would see something coming in the rear view mirror i mean not the rear those little side mirror things and it would look like it was further back than it was 
yeah 
yeah 
but the little thing etched in it 
say objects are are closer than they appear or something 
yeah 
does yours do that too 
yeah 
oh i was wondering if all vans did that 
well you you can you can uh install those mirrors 
we 've got the big side mirrors which are really nice 
i do n't know if you 've well if you 've driven a pick up truck you know 
these are these uh mirrors are must be six inches across not nearly a foot high 
uh-huh 
and they really nice uh 
i 'm on both sides 
actually they they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back 
yeah 
but there uh-huh 
well see that 's the reason that we could n't make really make them 
at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it 
but then that gas mileage was just atrocious 
i mean it 's unreal 
um-hum 
it 's you just practically do n't get any 
uh well they have got some of the newer ones they you know with the aerodynamic features 
you can get pretty pretty decent gas mileage 
yeah 
and then uh he talked about a van 
and i said well you know i do n't know i do n't know how the gas is on most of these 
and another thing was 
that 's the reason i said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car 
but i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere 
oh 
uh-huh 
yeah 
but really and truly the safety features 
but i would n't get one that 
if it had the seat belts on the door now i would n't get it 
yeah 
period 
interesting enough ford announced that i think in ninety two they 're going to put uh air bags in their in their vans 
oh that would be good 
so uh and i think i i believe safety 
i i i i really do believe in this stuff uh 
and i i think it 's important 
i 'm not 
the air bags are a good deal 
but um surprisingly uh they 're uh 
you really need to do 
you need a combination of both the air bags and the uh and your seatbelt 
oh i think so too 
so 
i do n't think they should do away with the seat belts now 
yeah 
i 'm 
but i think you need the shoulder thing i think you need the thing around your waist 
yeah 
but i think you need that bag to pop out too 
yeah 
you know because i know so many people here that have been killed in head on collisions where maybe if they had they had that that air bag they may still be walking around 
yeah 
but uh i think it 's fantastic 
i wish they required it in everything 
every new car that came out i wish they would require it in it 
it would be interesting to see what that 'd do to our insurance rates you know if if uh if the insurance companies says it says we 're not going to pay you know a claim if if the car does n't have air bags 
would be interesting would n't it 
yeah 
uh that would n't be fair 
but uh 
well no because what they would do is that 's what they 're going to plan on you know 
they would have to do it 
the insurance company would have to do the same thing 
they 're given like a ten year time limit where 
yeah 
okay 
these cars i guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years and then you know if you did n't have a car that had one in it then your insurance would go up enormously 
yeah 
uh i 've got to go 
my son 's in a performance tonight 
i have to leave in a couple of minutes 
oh that 's okay 
uh i think we 've probably spent a reasonable amount of time 
okay 
it was good talking to you 
well you you too 
okay 
good night 
all right 
bye bye 
okay 
well i just got back from taking my little girl to her brownie meeting 
and then we had this whole can uh a bag filled full of cans and they 've been recycling at their school 
uh-huh 
well she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow 
um-hum 
but they were filled with beer cans 
and i hated to take a big old sack i mean we 're talking you know like a lawn bag full of them 
like i 
no 
we 'll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway 
uh-huh 
they get tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans 
and i think that 's all 
oh 
oh okay 
and they 're taking the money that they earn to plant trees 
oh that 's a good idea 
yeah 
and they 've got those bins that just stay there 
and they decorated them real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff 
uh-huh 
so they 're getting into it 
i do n't know what they get for the tickets though 
what do you get for the tickets if you bring stuff 
oh the class i guess gets the most tickets gets uh gets a party 
oh that 'd be good 
so that 's not bad 
yeah 
um i know 
we um we 're we are kind of getting into recycling now 
i 'm in college 
and i live in a dorm 
and we recycle paper 
um-hum 
and i know there 's a glass plant up here 
and they recycle glass 
and you know we recycle aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff 
so in each of the dorms you have a place for that 
uh-huh 
ah that 's really good 
um-hum 
yeah 
and then when our dorm we whenever our bins are all filled up we take them and turn them in 
and then we get money for that 
so hm for the dorm 
and who decides what you do with it 
yeah 
we just put you know we just keep it with the dorm 
and what do they do with it 
well we buy things for the dorm whatever the dorm needs you know 
like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things 
and then we buy like cooking equipment and stuff 
uh-huh 
or we play games like board games 
we buy board games 
you know it 's just different things whatever you know 
would we vote on it 
and whatever the dorm would want that 's what we buy 
well i graduated from college in nineteen seventy two 
um-hum 
and we were just um not aware that this was a problem that we ever would need to recycle 
yeah 
anything of course you just threw it away 
uh-huh 
so a little different 
and i wanted to do this thing that you can get through target to recycle 
i had my school do it 
but my principal said since we 're doing this thing called operation desert shield we 're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all this 
um-hum um-hum yeah 
for the whole school you know 
it was just this big project 
she did n't want to get into that 
and i could do it in the center 
and i just never got around to it 
but it 's like a club 
you know about that 
um-hum 
there was a little boy that had died of leukemia i think 
and he was had started this um save the environment club 
um-hum oh 
and his mother is carrying this on 
and you can get the information to set it up you know or join 
uh-huh 
you do n't have to join it as a group or anything i do n't guess 
oh that 'd be good 
but you could start your own anyway 
get a a pamphlet 
um-hum um is that what this target is 
what you 're 
um-hum do y 'all have target stores up there 
no 
no 
huh-uh 
that 's a department store 
oh 
kind of like k mart except it 's a little better than what k mart sells i think 
uh-huh 
uh-huh oh oh 
i was like 
what 's target what 's target 
no 
um there 's i do n't really know any other recycling that they do 
we so you 're not pick- you 're not having it picked up at your houses or anything 
no 
we no 
huh-uh 
we have to take it to a a recycling place 
yet huh 
now in some of the towns around us they 're already picking up the newspapers 
um-hum 
well they 're doing that here too now that i think about it once every so many weeks 
and you have to pull out all the slicks 
and you have to wrap them up with string 
oh 
and i think that 's all they 're picking up 
but you know like in minnesota they 've got those bins where you put your plastics and your bottles 
oh i did n't know that 
yeah 
because w- my brother-in-law lives in minnesota 
and they 're just nice plastic bins 
and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash 
and they pick them up 
um oh i never heard of that 
so do y 'all have can banks 
um not that i know of 
no 
no 
it 's just 
a big old bin 
and you just feed your cans slowly in through slot 
and your money comes out you know every once in a while for however much poundage you 've got 
and you keep feeding it till the light goes off and you get instant cash 
oh my gosh 
but they had one that i was putting my stuff in 
and i went to take some today 
and it was gone 
hm 
i do n't know 
but i i located another one today on the way to work 
yeah uh 
we have places where we go 
and we what we do is we unload our cans 
it 's like a conveyor belt 
and the belt um separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because of it has a magnet on it 
and then they weigh all your aluminum cans 
and then you get money for your aluminum cans 
but they do n't give you for the other 
no 
but now they 're going to start giving us money for the other ones too 
before they did n't 
but i know they 're going to start now 
well that uh-huh 
well they 're certain places you know where i know you can take your leaded cans 
but i do n't know where they are 
they publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it 
um-hum 
i do n't know 
i 'm trying 
but i just can n't recycle everything 
yeah 
yeah 
just not that dedicated 
uh-huh yeah 
but 
well that 's all i really know about recycling 
me too 
if they would 
oh i know we 're saving our grocery bags now 
oh really 
yeah 
they 're taking those up 
you can take them to the stores 
um like kroger 's doing it and i think skaggs 
do you have those up there 
we have kroger but not a skaggs 
and we they 're taking our milk cartons and our plastic coke bottles there too 
oh 
so 
huh 
pretty good is n't it 
you guys are getting into it more than we are 
it sounds like it 
you 'd think you would be 
um-hum 
huh-uh 
i 've never seen any you know places that do 
i know um you we reuse our grocery bags now 
we take them back y- you know and use the ones that we have 
you can like if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones 
you mean where you sack your own groceries 
yeah 
yeah 
but we do n't have any place that collects the grocery bags 
huh 
and i do n't want to go with those canvas bags right now 
i 'm sorry 
i 'm not that european 
but you know they do that like 
i went to europe uh nineteen seventy three 
yeah um-hum 
and every you know they go all the time 
i mean it 's like they would go almost everyday to the store 
and they had their little bags way back then and fill it up 
um-hum 
and they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators 
oh my 
that 's why 
i mean they could n't put anything in it hardly 
but 
hum 
well what are you going to be when you get out of college 
i 'm a finance major 
well that 's why i started what i did 
i think i went into teaching 
here in texas it 's a real mess right now 
oh oh really 
oh definitely 
there 's no 
wh- let 's see 
we 've had the funding 
we 've run out of money 
we 've frozen the money 
right 
and they had until the fifteenth of april to come up some formula that would be more equitable to dis- different districts according to finances because the poor districts were getting less money so not as good an education 
um-hum 
right 
and now they 're trying to take some money away from the richer districts like the one that i 'm in in dallas and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable 
and if they can n't come up with something by the fifteenth then the state 's supposed to decide the courts 
what do you think the outcome will be 
i think they 're going to uh maybe give us a state income tax 
do you have one 
yeah 
we 're not looking forward to it 
but something 's got to be done 
yeah 
oh yeah 
we 've had one as long as i can remember 
i mean well it 's going to hit us 
yeah 
and i do n't know 
it did- 
does n't seem like it would work to take it away when we 're using it 
but maybe 
i know we 're not using it so wisely 
um-hum 
we have too many administrators in some of these big districts 
yeah 
um-hum 
but other than that well can you think of anything else we need to talk about 
um i can n't think of anything on recycling 
me either 
anything else 
no 
what about people from uh pennsylvania 
what do they think about texans 
what do we think about them 
um-hum 
oh i do n't 
have you thought about that 
no 
i never really thought about it 
i have no clue what you guys think about pennsylvanians 
um probably a lot more civilized more um refined than a lot of the people would be down here 
oh really 
i would hope so 
i mean you 've been together a little bit longer than we have 
i i do n't know 
i really do n't know anyone from texas or anything 
there 's some no 
i 've never been there hum-um 
well i 've never 
let 's see 
i think i have too been to pennsylvania 
gettysburg 
yeah 
yeah 
we went up there now that i think about it on one of our long trips we take off on 
uh-huh 
oh well 
she 'd 
be big i do n't know what are you saying holly 
oh my little girl is in the second grade and told me to tell you that shboom means good-bye in the israeli language 
oh 
israel is what you say it is holly 
israel in israel 
see she 's got this little girl from israel in her classroom that she 's befriended 
oh 
so she 's into this 
oh well is it like a foreign exchange type student 
huh-uh 
you know we 've had a lot of the jewish uh people 
well ironically enough i 'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before last 
oh no 
i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle 
awe 
yeah 
so 
exercise is not supposed to do that to you 
that 's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way you know down the hallway 
do you do anything on a regular basis 
uh-huh well i i off and on 
off and on 
right now i 've been off 
off but um i 've been going over to the fitness center 
yeah 
that 's a good 
yeah 
my husband 's a tier in the house unit here 
yeah 
three times 
yeah three uh-huh well i try to go over there at least three times a week 
and i try to walk um at least five times a week 
do you when you go to the texans 
i have to ask you 
and if this is getting to 
we 're not supposed to get too particular 
but i 'm just curious 
when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the dallas location or the spring creek in terms of there 's so much it 's so much of a weight orientation weight lifting et cetera 
uh-huh yeah 
uh well i 've been going to spring creek 
i have n't been to the dallas one now in oh a couple of years 
uh-huh 
ye- well at least since they 've redone it supposedly redone 
so i do n't really 
yeah 
it- well it 's not that great 
and i go to the spring creek one on and off 
but my husband 's working over there 
and he just goes to the dallas one 
but i just do n't 
i mean i just it 's so much weight lifting 
even the spring creek one has a lot of weights in it 
know what yeah yeah 
that 's true 
or is that what your into 
or 
no 
no 
well i 've i 've used the the nautilus equipment and the the bikes and stair climbers and stuff like that mostly 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i do n't use the free weights 
but 
i like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there 
yeah 
i like those too 
and the pool when it gets warmer 
and the pool 
yeah 
that 's great 
yeah 
i know 
well what i did was i went to a jazzercise class in a a new location in richardson near where we live in north dallas 
and long story short i had n't 
this is really a stupid thing that happened 
but they have like the gymnasium flooring 
and then like they had like about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where i usually stand in any class like that i go to 
uh-huh 
instead of having that level you know they had a chrome strip that was n't level 
uh-huh 
and it was about four inches deep and then about a oh a seventy degree angle 
oh my goodness 
and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it 
um 
the orthopedist called it a uh basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped 
uh-huh woo 
i know 
we went to uh hda we- well whatever hda plano 
and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show 
and the doctor said you did n't do anything 
there 's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you 
that was tuesday night 
and wednesday night the radiologist called me at work 
and uh i was on crutches 
and he said i think you better call an orthopedist 
so we went to one 
and he just put a big old cast on it 
uh-huh uh-huh um put a big cast on it 
yeah 
for about four weeks 
four weeks 
yeah 
so i mean i like aerobics 
but i 'm not so sure 
not that much though 
no 
i 've never 
i was off for about six months too just for some other surgery i 'd had 
but i 've never i 'd you know i was pretty much in shape walking 
and and you know this is one of those things 
like this orthopedist said he said you 'd be surprised how many basket- how many people come in here with things like that because they are active 
yeah 
you know i was real embarrassed 
but i felt kind of stupid 
well those things happen though 
yeah 
they do 
i mean i guess i 'm glad you know that um nobody really noticed 
i guess you could say 
yeah 
because i got up and started jumping on it again 
well that would that did a lot of good 
i 'm sure 
yeah 
really 
so i enjoy aerobics 
and i do it because i like it 
i mean i like the music and that kind of stuff 
yeah 
i like the music 
but i 've been unable to do that because i hurt my foot about five years ago 
i broke my heel 
oh that makes my foot 
and uh so no 
how 'd you do that 
in aerobics 
no 
actually i was up on a ladder and uh fell off leaned the wrong way 
oh goodness 
uh-huh 
and when i came down i hit with my full weight on my foot but on concrete 
what 'd they do for that 
did they have to cast it 
yeah 
they had well they had to go in and do surgery 
they put a pin in it 
an- oh so the aerobics the impact would not be good 
yeah 
yeah that cause i permanently damaged the the uh cushion under my heel you know the the normal cushion that you have there 
oh goodness 
uh-huh 
so i can n't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt 
oh that makes sense 
so i mean are you in terms of other things like like like not running but playing te- little bit of tennis or can you not do stuff like that at all 
uh well i have n't tried that 
i do n't know 
it 's been i bet -s it 's been thirty years since i played tennis 
yeah 
it 's been 
but um mostly into just walking and stuff like that 
that 's probably the safer way 
because i notice in aerobics um lot of the women that that do n't look like they should n't be doing certain things i 'm always afraid they 're going to fall over and have a coro- coronary 
uh-huh 
ye- 
and there was my ego when i went ahead 
and i went oh i can do that 
and half the time though i do n't um jump half as much as 
uh-huh 
i mean i 'm like i 'm real tall 
and you know i 'm i 'm not heavy 
but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height um i 'm five eleven you know you just take it easy 
uh-hum 
uh-hum oh sure 
um but when i see some wo- 
i mean so- and i just do n't think it 's healthy 
all that pounding all the time 
it is n't really it 's not really good for your knees 
so yeah 
that 's the other reason 
and i do n't know 
this was just i guess something freak that happened to me 
because i was n't fa- familiar with the 
uh-hum well the floor was uneven 
um oh it was completely 
i mean it literally 
the two dissimilar floor lev- floor coverings were not level 
and at first after it happened i thought maybe that 's a handicap access 
and then i said no 
that 's just the way it 's constructed 
you know sure yeah yeah 
and my husband being a ti engineer 
i said i said a few things to him when i got home 
i said who has engineered that 
really 
but i 
uh sounds like you like 
one thing that i like like swimming you like that a lot 
uh-huh 
yeah i like swimming 
uh-huh 
do you like that what 'd that voice say 
do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to 
uh no 
i like i like it because i i want to 
it makes me feel better 
that 's how i am 
yeah 
yeah 
if i do n't do it i just feel like i do n't have as much energy 
uh-huh 
i mean it 's real funny because if you you know 
it just seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you 'd be tired 
but it 's the other way around 
right 
it curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff 
uh-huh yeah 
really 
yeah 
but 
and i need all the help i can get 
that gravity factor 
i know 
uh-hum uh-huh 
it does get you 
like that orthopedist said to me he said do n't worry diane 
he says he said uh you 're at thirty something 
but you 're on the upper side 
he said that uh do n't worry 
he says even if you were n't doing anything your body would start that would start to happen to you 
but 
thanks a lot 
yeah 
because i was saying to him i said i 'm not that heavy 
i 'm not heavy you know 
maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being 
uh-huh 
i said uh why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more 
and he goes human nature 
and then you know you see these little girls in these little bitty things 
and they 're all like twenty one years of age 
no uh-huh 
but luckily at texans there 's a little more diver- diverse clientele 
uh-hum that 's true 
they do 
except for the guys that lift the weights 
they do intimidate 
they do yeah 
i try try to go real late or real early before they get there 
there 's yeah 
there some things i 'd like to try 
but you know sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what 
uh-huh 
that 's one thing i like about the spring creek place 
uh at least the fellow that 's there one of the fellows that 's there at night and on weekends is real helpful 
uh-huh 
and his name is b j 
i do n't think i 've ever i think i 've 
that there was some girl there 
i 've been there like maybe a dozen times 
and uh-huh 
but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to 
uh-huh 
it 's terrible 
it 's i do n't know if the dallas location 
it just seems that 
um sometimes i feel like i 'm in a singles bar 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's true 
ye- i and i have n't have n't noticed that up at spring creek 
no 
i have n't either 
and i just uh 
it 's not that far of a drive 
and i 'm glad they did that 
um you 're not missing anything at the dallas renovated site 
it 's not at all anything worth talking about 
yeah 
i thought maybe one of these days i 'll drive over there and check it out 
yeah 
but if you do n't live near there that 's not worth 
but yeah 
i live in richardson 
but it 's about half way between the spring creek and the and the dallas site 
we yeah 
that 's that 's actually where this happened to me out in i say plano 
but it 's all the same to me 
richardson over on campbell and park hill there 's a uh new recreation center 
so uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh 
and uh as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities 
walked out 
i was limping and 
i 'm like oh great i have purple tights on you know 
uh-huh 
and they 're going yes 
but in general i like to exer- i i like dance a lot 
so i mean i aerobics is something i 'd hate to give up 
but he he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot 
but he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling 
or 
yeah 
probably will for a while because it it 's going to be real tender 
he told me eight to twelve weeks 
when they uh-huh 
not anything you know 
i said but you 're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks 
he said yeah 
but that 's just 
they tried to put me in some kind of um immobilized walker because he does n't like to put casts on when it 's warm 
but i just 
the more they tried to get my foot in the more i screamed 
i could n't you know adjust that 
yeah i know what you mean 
well you you know more about this stuff than i do obviously then 
yeah it 's not fun 
no 
well you 're walking okay now obviously 
and you can 
oh yeah 
i i have a slight limp from it 
but it matches one if i have one on the other side 
yeah 
well is there anything else about exercise we can talk about 
yeah you know well other than i need to go 
yeah 
me too 
me too 
i need to go actually get something to eat here 
you know more i need go more but it 's great though 
i really do enjoy it 
okay 
thank you sandy 
sure 
thanks then bye-bye 
uh-huh 
bye-bye 
uh well what would you say your opinion is on gun control 
well i do n't know 
i 've i 've had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to uh the radio and and watch tv about the different uh things that are happening 
i uh i 'm against it 
but on the same token um i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right to do that 
so i i have a rifle in the house 
um the ammunition is probably so old i 'm afraid to use it 
but uh i bought it for target practicing and uh and also because i wanted a weapon 
uh how do you feel about it 
well i think uh down here in texas they do n't have a waiting period on handguns 
hm 
and i think they need that 
uh now i do have a i have a pistol 
it 's a little twenty two 
and i have a twenty two or a twelve gauge shotgun 
uh-huh 
and you know i do like to have my guns 
uh i do n't know if i 'll ever use it you know 
and like you my bullets to my little pistol 's probably uh about three years old 
uh my gun has n't been shot in a year or two 
uh-huh 
but uh i like to have them where handy 
well up uh up in new england where i 'm from uh y- you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammuit- amm- ammunition 
and i thought that was really good 
and i think it they uh 
takes two weeks for that system to process um your request for uh not as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition 
you have to get a p- permit from the police station in your local area to do that 
i 've never heard of anything like that 
yeah 
um 
that would be nice 
but a- you know 
the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other 
i i i agree 
i think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is uh to to stop the impulse buyer from um buying it quickly and and um maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it 
but if someone 's really determined to to pick up a firearm uh you can pick it up anyplace 
yeah 
and you can get them really cheap 
i know 
i- i uh th- i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in uh tennessee and uh they had a waiting period 
uh-huh 
and uh we bought it there 
and 
how long was the waiting period out there 
about nine days 
ah 
that was n't too too bad 
no 
no 
because i- if you 're going to go buy something um of of that nature i think you 've you 're going to have some idea as to what you 're going to do with it 
you 're not going to react that quickly 
in other words you know you -o n't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day 
yeah 
somebody want do th- 
i i at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms 
yeah 
i do too 
uh because it does n't make any difference uh uh whether it 's a pistol or a shotgun i suppose 
they both do the same kind of job 
shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does 
uh yeah 
i suppose 
i 'd never got shot with either one 
but i do n't know um 
i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun 
a shotgun 's got too much of a spread 
or at least ours does 
yeah 
uh it you know 
you have a little uh thing on the bo- bottom of th- on top of the barrel where you a- you turn it 
uh-huh 
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get 
oh 
and the spread changes 
uh i 've got a a manual singled shot 
and i guess it does n't have any any automatic features to it 
the further away i get the the uh wider the shot gets from the target 
yeah 
and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets 
it 's got a hell of a kick to it 
yeah 
my husband had a uh a police gun at one time 
and i shot that thing one time 
almost knocked me down 
it was just a little 
i don- i forget 
i think it was a three fifty seven 
i 'm not sure 
do you belong to a gun club or you 
he belonged to one awhile back 
uh since we mo- 
we 've only been here in texas for about a year uh we can n't even find a place to shoot just for target practice 
uh um-hum 
no kidding 
but i 'd love to get used to that shotgun 
we traded his pistol for that shotgun 
huh 
well the the um uh clubs that we 've got around here are kind of expensive 
but uh it 's well worth it 
you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and so- targets and have uh competition 
um i 've never really joined a club because i have n't got the time not because i have n't got the desire 
uh there 's an annual membership fee uh that 's that 's fairly high 
plus there 's initi- initiation fee that you have to pay as a first time uh uh member 
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars just to join the club 
plus you have to pay for the the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in 
yeah 
well that 's what uh my husband 
wh- when he was in it gun club when they 's done that 
it you know 
he went mostly just to um shoot at paper targets 
uh-huh 
uh but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that 
i think the the gun clubs serve a useful purpose 
in fact i 'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to uh show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon 
that 's a good 
i 've never thought of that 
that 's a good point 
and you know it it 
even a- after you wait your nine days if you do n't know how to hand- it 's just like putting someone in an automobile that does n't know how to drive 
and you give him a license because he waited nine days 
yeah 
that 
and yeah 
he could he could not only um uh shoot himself 
he could he could uh mishandle a weapon leave it at home and let a child get at it 
and 
well we uh we was living on a navy base down in memphis 
and uh this one guy decided to play uh lonesome cowboy or something 
and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot 
wow 
he was fortunate 
he could he could of hit something else 
well he went tumbling down the steps along with uh shooting his foot almost off 
he broke his leg and a collar bone and couple of other things i 'm sure being mister cowboy 
wow 
i can n't remember what the na- term was going around 
it was about four to five years ago 
but naw th- i guess that would be a good idea 
how about uh private citizens selling uh weapons 
like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me 
huh how do you feel about that 
do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the um buyer and the seller 
and or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system uh because you own it 
uh that 's a hard one because we did that 
but uh i think there ought to be some rule against it 
i 'll uh you know 
the person who sells the gun ought to protect themself because if that gun 's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something the cops are going to come to you 
yeah 
but is- is n't there a way to um to deregister yourself after you register a gun 
ah 
i have no idea 
i 've only had one gun 
because i have 
and i 've kept it you know uh the one gun that was in my name 
yeah 
is it registered 
yeah 
the um the rifle that i 've got is not registered 
and um i do n't know why i never registered it 
but the uh 
i do n't think you have to register a shotgun 
um i 'd i 'd i think it 's it 's voluntary 
the um the 
well see uh my husband has a thing 
if they go to uh regulating uh all right uh banning guns o- pri- private pri- private ci- citizens this 
yeah 
my kid is jumping on me 
i can n't hardly talk 
um my husband feels that they 'll come and collect everybody 's guns 
yeah 
i guess that could happen 
it 's just like the uh the social security system 
once they uh they gave everybody a number 
and now they 're making you um uh get one at at birth 
and once they have your number they have you know your identification 
yeah 
and if you try to to do anything um like uh not identify yourself to the government they know who you are 
and everything about you 
and that 's true 
uh i 
bu- you know they know it from how much money you make a week to uh probably your uh 
my kid is banging 
i was seeing what they was banging on 
uh i 've lost my train of thought 
i 'm sorry 
that 's all right 
yeah you were talking about uh um fed- what the federal government knows about people 
oh the social 
yeah 
they pr- they probably know everything from half the time wh- ho- what time you go to the bathroom 
they probably do 
no 
that 's that 's a little bits extreme 
but they could know anything and everything about you 
and uh i 'd like to have my gun 
if they go to banning banning them i 'd lose my gun 
but we would n't lose our pis- or ou- shotgun 
yeah 
and uh we 're wanting to get a couple more that no one knows about 
uh-huh 
but i do n't i do n't uh 
do you find it difficult picking up uh guns that that are not registered 
naw 
no 
i do n't either 
i can i can buy some uh today if i wanted to 
just you know put up the money 
yeah 
w- 
yes 
well you can look in the uh the 
we got the thing down here called a shopper 
uh-huh 
it 's a a who a it 's a it 's a bargain thing 
uh you go and everyb- you know i always see guns in there five to seven guns a day 
yeah 
it comes out every tuesday 
and there 's there 's no waiting period on that 
naw 
none whatsoever 
you ca- call 
w- we sold a refrigerator through it 
and it took us all of twelve hours 
you sell the refrigerator 
yeah 
yeah 
you know and i 'm sure it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun 
hm 
yeah i think the federal government is um is really far away from uh um control 
i i do n't believe in um 
should i should n't probably say control 
i mean regulation 
control is something that i would n't want the federal government to have 
b- um but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons 
yeah 
well i 'll agree with you there 
they do have too much control over us already 
yeah 
uh we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have 
unfortunately we uh we vote for the the people who spend the money 
so i can n't complain too much 
yeah 
i guess so 
i do n't know 
they 're 
okay 
so what kind of movies have you seen lately i guess 
um a lot 
well the last movie i saw but it was n't my choice was the ninja turtle movie 
obviously you have kids 
that 's right 
yeah 
but uh my preference is the one we saw before that was silence of the lambs 
i have n't seen that one yet 
that 's an excellent movie 
um i s- the last movie i saw was uh sleeping with the enemy 
oh was that good 
i heard 
and i uh see i 'm not a big julie roberts fan 
oh okay 
um but i was a lot i wa- i was a lot more uh impressed with her than i thought i would be 
well that 's good 
it turned out to be a better thriller than i was expecting it to be 
yeah 
so yeah 
it was a pretty good movie 
that 's uh silence of the lambs kept me on the edge of my seat 
i i 'm ready to go 
it just 
uh it 's you know has n't worked out that way yet 
right 
but um you know it 's uh it looks good you know if you like thrillers anyway 
yeah 
it is 
right 
and i do 
in fact uh people that i 've talked to said that they had n't slept real good for a while afterwards 
so 
i- oh really 
oh i love them like that 
so yeah 
i 'm not 
i mean i i like all ranges of movies 
but i like that where they 're real intense 
uh-huh 
i really enjoy 
they keep me guessing the whole time 
it 's really it 's real it was really interesting 
uh-huh 
uh-huh well what other movies have you seen then lately 
oh 
other than the 
i assume you were talking about the new ninja turtles 
yes 
the new one of course 
movie is that any good 
i mean i 'm sure i 'm going to be seeing it because i 'm going in a week to amarillo where my sister lives and she 's got two boys that i took to see the first one 
oh 
so i 'm sure i 'm going to see the next one here real soon 
it 
really was i did n't see it the first one 
my husband said it was um about the same lines 
oh well then it wo n't be too bad 
so yes 
i mean i was you know it was n't impressive necessarily 
but it was better than it could have been 
right 
right 
and um i was i was impressed with the fact that um it was n't that childish 
yeah 
you know what i mean 
it was n't 
my daughter 's five 
i mean she understood everything 
she goes to almost all movies with us except you know r rated 
and uh she really enjoyed it 
but but it was on a on a higher level you know where there were some things that kids did n't understand that adults did 
and i liked that 
right right yeah 
i think that 's important if you 're you know if you 're going to you know kids are going to or parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi you know semi for them too 
right 
that 's right 
that 's right 
so yeah 
and it it 's pretty good 
but we take we take her to just about every movie 
and she uh she does really good 
we 've taken her from real young 
and she does real good 
like i said we do n't take her to r 's 
uh-huh 
so if and when we ever get a babysitter like we did with silence of the lambs we go see it 
uh-huh was about to say you 're not going to take her to that one i 'm sure 
no no 
no 
do you take her or do you go to a lot of uh like comedy movies 
or to 
yeah 
yeah 
what was the last comedy you saw 
um oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw 
huh huh huh good question 
good question 
we do n't get to go that often 
but i 'm something on the tip of my tongue 
and i can n't think of which one it was 
um gosh i can n't remember 
the last uh 
in fact i guess this was the last movie i saw i said that wrong 
i uh-huh 
um the last movie i saw was the hard way with uh michael j fox 
but that that sounds that sounds good 
well that really was n't too bad 
it there were 
you know he 's supposed 
you know he 's this actor right and he 's he 's playing a a cop 
uh-huh 
right 
well he 's he 's he 's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the the stuff 
i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop 
oh okay 
you know what i mean there there were times when he was like you know he 'd be running with a gun or whatever 
he did n't look like a cop when he did it 
and i was so impressed with that because you know you 
uh-huh that 's neat 
cause that the part was hard to to do that 
y- oh yeah 
because i mean yeah because i everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to you know to imitate them or whatever 
right 
and and uh you know i thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far 
yeah 
now you know at the by the end he was looking more like a cop but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was he was trying to you know trying to get it 
right 
but he was n't there yet 
yeah right 
but you could tell like 
i said i thought was a real good acting and writing job both you know because i think or directing job 
i think they did a real good job of that 
uh-huh 
and um james woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop 
i mean you know he just 
yeah 
i like him 
yeah 
yeah and there were there were some definite um uh should i say tense moments with him in there 
probably the last comedy we saw now that i think about it is home alone 
so yes 
i i i had seen it before christmas 
but i took a uh a date to it uh about a month ago 
so i i i 've seen it the second time not too long ago 
so 
yeah uh-huh it was really cute 
i really enjoyed it 
of course the bad thing about it was uh uh the the second time i saw it i did n't really enjoy it as much 
and i was kind of surprised at that 
i thought that would be one of those that i would love to watch over and over 
yeah 
again but before 
i- maybe it 's just the idea of my reaction the first time i laughed so hard i was hoarse 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
i mean you know i really was i was hoarse getting out of there 
yeah 
and maybe i just laughed so hard the first time that i did n't have it 
i mean it just was n't as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time 
right 
i do n't know 
but 
yeah maybe so 
maybe so 
yeah 
i mean it was it was a great movie though 
i loved the movie 
yeah 
i did too 
i 'm looking forward to this summer uh naked gun two and a half is coming out 
i love those movies 
i do too 
i mean they are just slapstick 
oh yeah 
and it 's 
just you have to see those twice to catch everything 
well you have to see them more than that 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean you know i- i still catch things in airplane that 
those yeah 
i mean it 's its amazing i love those movies i really do 
i do too 
i do too 
so i 'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious as they all do 
yeah 
oh yeah 
but well we we try to go a couple of times a month i guess to see a movie 
uh-huh 
it it 's just getting so expensive 
oh is n't it though 
you know but that 's at least the good thing about you know the texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper 
right but normally we do n't think about it until 
but yeah that 's exactly what i was going to say 
i keep i keep not doing it until after i 'm there 
and then all of a sudden i 'm saying i wish i 'd bought these things 
right i know because we can go spend fifteen dollars just the just getting in the three of us 
easily 
yeah 
yeah 
and that 's and then you know if you want popcorn and stuff it 's just i mean uh it 's incredible no 
i do n't understand why they ch- they they charge you out the kazoo for both 
you know popcorn is not that expensive 
no 
it 's nowhere near that expensive 
when you buy yeah and so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke 
and it it 's just the idea that these uh these actors you know live in such lavish style 
i mean it 's as simple as that 
we just keep breeding them 
yeah 
and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them 
that way i guess so 
now have you seen dances with wolves 
you know yes 
oh yeah 
oh that was that was an excellent movie 
did you love it i have n't seen 
we 're waiting for the video 
no 
do n't 
no 
really 
do n't 
that needs the big screen 
oh 
it really and truly does because to get the feeling of like when the buffaloes are when they 're chasing the buffaloes and everything you 've got to be where you feel it 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
oh really 
you really truly do 
oh 
i would 
i mean you know i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too 
but i 'm glad i did n't 
i really and truly am 
i mean it that mov- that was one movie i came out impressed 
really uh-huh 
i really and truly did 
i mean i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven oscars 
none at all 
that 's 
i mean i 'm normally i 'm one of these people that i do n't like one one movie taking all the honors 
good 
i heard that yeah 
yeah 
i i wanted him to win best best actor on top of it 
i mean it was just he was 
yeah oh 
like i said he was now i would n't have i would n't given the supporting actress or actresses either one 
yeah 
but the uh you know even though they were okay the girl in it 
uh they 
uh somebody made an interesting observation 
now that i think back on it i 'd say yeah i can n't believe that either 
she was the only indian to have her hair done at all times 
you know what i mean you know 
it was just too perfect at all times 
oh gosh yeah 
that was a mistake that they made 
they should n't have done it 
yeah 
now the best 
the supporting actor he was good 
but from what i heard the guy who got it was better 
so i you know i can see that 
yeah 
but oh 
yeah do you think my daughter would like it 
oh well there are there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side 
or just oh okay 
but um it 's it 's 
she does n't mind when we cover up her eyes 
okay 
no problems 
it it 's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide the hides 
so there 's 
see that 's the one that is the honest to god the one reason i do n't want to see the movie is because i love buffaloes for some weird reason 
you know there 's yeah 
but well and and of course 
and i know they 're fake 
and well yeah 
that and plus i mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt 
so i mean they are killing buffaloes in it 
but they do n't stress that very much 
they really do n't 
okay 
okay 
and i think it 's an excellent movie for 
if if she enjoys movies i think it 'll work pretty good 
oh that 'll be good 
yeah we we really need some 
my husband keeps wanting to 
yeah it 's it 's it 's a long movie 
yeah 
and i heard the video 's even going to be longer 
oh yeah 
they 're going to put in a lot of stuff that they cut out 
i may have to see the video 
yeah 
that 's that 's true 
they said 
i had n't even thought of that 
yeah 
they said there 's a lot that had been edited because of the length and that they wanted in 
uh-huh 
so they 're going to put it in the video 
uh-huh yeah 
and that way you can watch it at your leisure 
well yeah 
i kind of like it when they do that because the video like i said 
there are certain things you can n't do with a video and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea 
so yeah 
that 's true yeah 
yeah 
because i mean when you rent a video 
videos of course are not cheaper either and um and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea because they they make bundles of money off those things 
true 
yeah i know it 
is n't that ridiculous 
we have cable which helps a lot 
oh i do too 
yeah 
but not enough 
yeah 
we keep holding out you know 
yeah 
i 'm getting to the point where you know i watch well i watch nick at nite 
well i have n't had too much of a chance to watch tv lately 
yeah 
so probably everything i 'm going to say is kind of dated 
well i can understand that 
it 's it 's that time of the year 
yeah 
uh we just uh my wife and i just recently moved into our house 
so we 're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but um i like to keep up to date too 
oh 
yeah 
yeah uh-huh 
um i guess in the 
since i got out of college which was about five years ago i 've my tv viewing has started to tend more towards uh documentary news programs things like that 
um-hum 
something that 's going to keep me up to date 
i 've kind of kind of gotten away from uh being a series watcher having to keep up to date with uh 
um-hum oh yeah 
i think when you 're in college you kind of you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week 
um-hum 
yeah 
that makes a big difference 
so so yeah 
i- i used to 
when my kids were real little and i was home i watched 
uh i was home more i watched things on a more regular basis 
but right now the last thing i watched regularly was thirty something when it first came out 
okay 
did y 'all ever watch that 
yeah i yeah started too and uh kind of kind of worked away from that 
yeah 
yeah 
i- i have a hard time sticking with something like on on on on tv because it like it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two 
yeah 
you feel kind of left out 
yeah yeah right 
right 
but um um-hum 
i know 
but i 'll tell you what um 
we 're really strict with our kids about television 
and one night a couple of weeks ago it was just a just happened that we were exhausted 
and they wanted to watch 
and we said okay well we 'll sit down 
and we 'll you know look at what you want to see 
let 's just turn it on and see what 's on 
we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it 
i believe that 
and so we you know and it was prime time 
it was what seven thirty eight oclock on a week night and n- we have cable 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and there was n't anything on any channel 
and and the stuff that was on the prime the networks you know abc nbc cbs was 
it was just um dribble do you know i mean it was n't even funny it was n't creative 
yeah 
that 's right 
it it was the worst i 've seen 
i mean i have not watched prime time week night tv i guess in a real long time because i was shocked 
yeah 
well i- i know exactly how you feel 
i- i just you know what i 'm saying 
that 's right 
i- i uh when i first moved down here uh moved into the apartment and got cable and uh i guess i- i sort of kind of became n- numb 
um-hum 
uh nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the tv you know 
and then all of a sudden i started paying paying attention to um to network tv again once in a while 
right 
right now we do n't have cable 
right 
and it 's surprising how much it 's changed the you know the the the whole moral situation everything is just just gone one whole complete direction different 
um-hum 
and uh w- we do n't have any kids yet 
but uh i i- i- i feel the same way 
it 's really tough to find something that 's that 's uh that 's going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um y- you know you you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons 
yeah um-hum um-hum right right 
oh 
and kids kids are n't even going to understand half the humor that 's in there 
yeah 
it 
none of it 's probably damaging lot of times 
right 
right it 's just it 's just an like a necessary evil 
i mean when we when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we we just had sesame street 
and that was about it you know 
but uh right 
right 
but now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff 
oh yes 
yeah 
but it 's just one of those things you know 
you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you 're if you 're in the room 
so but it 's such a shame because it could be so good 
that 's right 
i- i do n't understand why first of all why the public puts up with it and second of all why the networks think that you know we enjoy that kind of stuff 
that 's right well that 's true 
i ca- it 's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that 
that can n't be the problem 
uh-huh 
it must be the marketing pressures 
and you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybody 's iq has dropped dramatically or something 
that 's i 'm glad you said it 
and i did n't have to 
but that that that 's the 
i feel the exact same way 
i sit i sit and watch some shows 
and uh and i 'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show 
i know 
ah it 's you know why do you do this to yourself 
why do you do this 
yeah 
i know 
i 'm trying to think if there 's anything i do 
you know i do like i like um stuff that 's on great performances 
and i we used to watch mystery quite quite a bit and enjoyed that 
okay 
stuff i guess that 's mostly public on public tv 
yeah right 
stuff as a matter of fact you know when i was a kid excuse me my parents used to have 
we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular tv that we watched we had to watch an hour of public tv 
now there 's an idea 
that was just the rule 
and if they saw us watching something 
they 'd say all right what did you see on what 's new 
or there was some other 
the children 's program i think at the time was called what 's new 
um okay 
yeah 
so we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program 
yeah 
yeah 
that 's that 's pretty good 
but do you watch do you watch sports on tv 
are you a sports fan 
i i can n't handle it very long 
yeah 
i i mean i 'm i 'm a i 'm a sports fan 
but uh i- it 's well it 's kind of it 's kind of like reading magazines any more 
if if half of the time was n't spent watching commercials it probably would n't be so bad 
yeah uh-huh um-hum right 
yeah 
but uh it it 's 
you 're missing an awful lot 
yeah 
i 'd rather personally rather watch see a game on t v than fight the crowds at the stadium 
but uh but uh no i do n't sit down 
yeah 
that 's true 
the traffic 
um 
i 'll i 'll sit down for the big games the super bowl and the championship you know things like that 
yeah 
but i do n't i do n't follow any team 
i i i check the scores the next morning 
and i know how everybody 's doing 
and that suffices me 
but uh i like i like good comedy good humor once in a while 
yeah 
um-hum um-hum yeah 
yeah yeah i- i enjoy that 
but what do you where do you oh do you get the co- 
well no we do n't yeah yeah 
you do n't have cable now 
i was going to say they have a comedy channel now 
but again you 're in a situation where you 're watching mostly uh commercials 
and then you 're you know trying to pass the time to wait till the next comedian comes up 
you know what i did 
there was a time there where i could um tape things 
and then i 'd fast forward through the commercials 
right uh-huh 
saved a lot of time that way 
that 
works 
you bet 
yeah 
but that takes too much planning 
yeah 
no 
i do n't know 
if there 's any any series or anything that i pay attention to i try to watch cheers once in a while 
um now that yeah is that still real good 
it used to be real good 
yeah 
it is 
is it 
in fact it 's i think it 's on tonight 
oh 
i just got in from outside 
so i so i 'm kind of out of it 
oh okay 
th- things like that 
and i i consider that fairly intelligent humor you know 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh you can tell 
they they they pick up the words every once in a while 
yeah right right 
right 
is n't it su- such a long running program 
yeah 
yeah 
they do have a good they do have good writers for that 
oh that makes me think 
do you watch saturday night live at all 
i try to 
yeah 
we try to stay up too 
yeah 
it 's getting harder and harder 
ten years ago was n't so hard to stay up 
if well yeah 
you know and and it was it was just automatic too 
no matter where you were you stopped and and sat down and watched it 
i think it 's come around again 
it 's gone through cycles 
to watch it yeah right yeah yeah 
it was 
it we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there 
but we started watching again 
but uh uh-huh 
but it 's a real different show than it was when it started 
yeah 
it 's it 's funny now 
and it 's better 
but it 's real different than what it used to be 
that 's right 
that 's right 
but you can n't be uh so um you can n't be outrageous 
right 
you know if you keep that same format 
there 's only so long that you can be outrageous 
so 
that 's for sure that is for sure 
well i guess there 's a few things around still 
but 
so yeah 
you have to hunt hard for them 
uh yeah sounds like we pretty much agree 
i guess yeah 
i guess so 
well 
well 
its been uh good talking to you 
yeah 
good talking to you 
okay 
take care 
you too 
bye 
bye 
are are you a uh a tier 
uh no 
no 
i work there as a temporary 
oh really 
but are you at ti 
oh yeah 
so you have to do the random drug testing 
oh yeah 
yeah 
i- 
i- in fact with me uh this is uh it 's not much to talk about 
i i 'm so much for it 
i do n't really have much to comment about it 
uh there 's been some interesting subjects that they 've ca- 
how many times have you called 
or have you been participating in this 
oh about ten ten or eleven calls 
uh oh you got ten 
well you you 've passed me up 
yeah 
this is about six times 
uh 
um as contract person we have to do random drug testing too 
yeah 
so it does n't bother me 
i do n't feel like it 's really a violation of privacy or anything 
no 
i think it 's good 
in fact uh i do n't know what the statistics were 
but i think that they were very surprised to find it so low 
i think they were expecting it to find uh like the national average at ti 
and i think it was tremendously down 
as far as the number of drug users you mean 
i think yeah a- as far as the number of people that they actually found that were drug use- 
or peop- huh 
but i think that uh i was well you ha- when i was at ti of course we had all the information before they started 
right 
and they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation rehabilitation programs 
and i think that 's what helps you know that that you know warning when you have a drug program uh you know the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go 
and then uh usually a lot of them uh partake in uh some of the benefits o- of rehabilitation and everything 
right 
yeah 
so that 's real beneficial for the company and the employee 
so yeah 
our our numbers have been way down 
i do n't know what they were 
oh when i worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person 
and so we had when we sent temporaries to ti we had to have them drug tested 
yeah 
and we did have a couple of cases where we really the person said that they had n't used anything 
and their test came back positive 
and normally we did n't retest them 
but there were a couple people that we really thought that they were telling the truth 
and we retested them like the next day 
and they came back negative the second time 
oh really 
so that that 's the only thing i think that might be a little bit of a problem 
oh yeah you 're 
that 's a good point 
but at ti they before they had the testing i 've forgotten i- s- seems like it 's a year ago september something like that they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government 
and and that of course that 's critical just as the point that you 're brought up that whoever does your testing -s got to be you know have a lot of quality control that they keep track of everything 
they do n't make mistakes 
that would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive 
right 
and they were not 
and i have n't heard of any 
now i 'm not in personnel or anything 
yeah 
but uh they say that there it 's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive 
and and they 're not you know 
in other words there 's very few mistakes 
and that of course has got to be critical 
it 's got to be if you have a drug testing program 
it 's got to be with a very very good agency 
you do n't just have you know some local uh group do it 
it 's got to be a a a highly qualified agency 
right 
yeah 
not just some doctor 's office somewhere 
no 
you do n't want to do that 
it 's got to be you know a laboratory that do quality control and and double check 
and i think that ti has has latched themselves up with an established group 
a- and that would be true for any company that does it and and not to have a just a very casual thing 
it 's got to be with a you know first class totally independent agency not local of course 
ours i think well i think it was in in the south somewhere 
but it was n't even in dallas you know the one that did us 
oh really 
yeah 
huh 
do you do they um have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive 
or do they fire them right away 
oh no 
no they 're not fired 
they there are they have one chance to then go in a program 
if you come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into 
they have a lot of uh rehabilitation both for alcohol and for drug use 
uh and they have uh a lot of uh th- they have an agency where you can go for personal problems financial or whatever 
or right 
and so they they they they do n't 
no 
it 's not firing first 
it 's uh definitely try to encourage people to rehabilitate 
in fact they again before you go you know 
tha- that 's why i said 
when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and if you may have taken drugs go ahead and and get rehabilitated first 
and and and they wo n't even say anything about it 
right 
i think that 's really good 
you know oh sure 
i know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something 
oh yeah 
no 
that that 's not right 
it 's really uh an illness or whatever you want to say that it is 
you know it 's a weakness and all 
and wh- who all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another 
and i think that uh those people that have that and and however they got into it 
i have children 
i always worry about the the classical thing that you see on tv where the drug uh pushers give it to the kids for free you know and get them sucked in 
and then they sell it to them 
you know the classical thing is to give it away 
right 
or i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party 
and they slip it to them 
i i do n't know 
i do n't even have that much knowledge to know whether that would uh get them addicted or not you know 
tha- that 's a real worry 
yeah 
some of the stories you read about cocaine that 's like people try it one time 
and they 're addicted 
my husband is a counselor 
and he works with uh mostly with adolescents 
oh you know a lot about it 
so yeah 
i hear a lot of horror stories about things like that 
then 
but most of the time it 's they get into a wrong crowd first 
and then they start a drug problem 
yeah no yeah 
it 's usually not a one time accidental thing i do n't think 
yeah 
i know 
i i 'm glad of that 
and i have uh knock wood had uh pretty good luck with or very good luck with my daughters so far 
know they 're not on it that 's my phone i 
i i have one daughter still at home 
one 's at ut 
and one 's at home gets dozens of calls a night 
yeah oh well i 'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that 
uh no no no no 
no 
i i i do n't care about that 
tha- tha- she she 'll be on the phone all night 
um yeah 
uh it seems like just if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that 's best way to avoid trouble from what i can gather 
yeah right 
do you have children 
no 
not yet 
we 're expecting a baby in july 
oh well great 
so we 're starting 
oh fan- fantastic experience 
i 've got two 
as i said i 've got one in at ut now in austin and one at home 
and uh i always say that i 've learned so much more from them than i than ever taught them 
from yeah yeah yeah 
it 's a uh fantastic experi- 
oh we 're really excited about it 
you ca- oh yeah 
you know one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing like on a saturday morning if they 've been out at a party friday night 
y- yeah 
and you 're not too sure what 's going on he tells parents all the time haul them into the doctor 's office and get them checked 
the the key thing that i think uh we try to do is that bring all the friends over here 
have our house as a place where they can come at any time so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome 
right 
and they 're always over in someone else 's house 
so our we 've been lucky that uh our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i think that 's a really good thing to encourage 
and and then you can kind of keep an you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want 
but at least you see what 's going on 
and uh you always have your house welcome then then your children 'll think that uh you know you 're cool parents and all that 
right 
you know we- well good luck with your your expected uh baby there 
oh well thanks 
uh my wife was yelling in my e- was talking in my ear 
she said uh reminded me to say that uh they 're very cheap until they get get to start driving 
uh-huh 
and we have one of course i say in college driving and and one going to drive this summer 
so uh kids are cost you practically nothing because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything 
but you wait until they go and get a car 
insurance and you and that 's when they get expensive 
as they get older you know uh i- i- th- they cost you practically nothing from one to five 
y- yeah 
and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons 
but uh it 's well worth it and everything 
gets worse yeah uh 
yeah 
i think it 'll be neat 
be great it 's a great experience really 
you still there 
yeah 
okay 
i thought that was cut off there 
but well good you know i do n't have much to say about drug testing 
no 
i can n't think of anything else to say about that either 
uh so you you 've done this ten times 
yeah 
okay did you get did you get the booklet on as to get the gifts and all 
uh no 
i i do n't work for ti 
so i get cash 
that oh okay 
well i i did n't know what they 're they were going to do 
they sent us a little booklet 
i just got it a week or so ago saying you know so many calls will be some- a prize and everything 
right 
well that 's great 
well what kind of cash 
i 've forgotten what were they going to do 
yeah 
was it five dollars a call 
there 's yeah hum yeah 
five dollars a call 
or something well hope i hope they follow through and everything 
yeah well technically we 're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we 're on them 
so i guess we better get off 
right 
yeah 
it was good talking to you 
well 
right right bye-bye now 
bye 
okay 
so what kind of cars are you looking at 
well we 've uh we 've we 've test driven the oldsmobile delta eighty eight and a a cutlass supreme and a used cadillac about three or four years old because uh i get married in a couple of weeks 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and i have two kids 
and my fiancee has two kids so we need we need a car that 's big enough for six 
um-hum 
yeah 
and so tha- we went i guess it was two weekends ago we went uh car shopping and looked around 
um-hum 
uh we found something interesting at crest oldsmobile cadillac up there on central expressway that uh in addition to to getting a new car there they can get you a car that 's new 
um-hum 
but it 's been uh a demonstrator model for uh two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car 
oh okay 
uh-huh 
so they call this program cars 
and they come with a new car warranty 
and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that 
right 
that 's a real good deal 
in fact my dad recently got a um a pontiac uh believe six thousand and he got a a demo 
uh-huh 
okay 
and it 's been a real good car and it 's it 's like new and it only had had very very low mileage on it 
yeah 
uh-huh 
sure 
and so he i think he got a real good deal 
of course they 're fully loaded usually 
oh yeah 
and so it 's a i think it 's a pretty good option 
yeah 
i think so too 
are the uh oldsmobiles that you 're looking at are they the demos 
or they used 
are they new 
well the the ones that we were test driving were the uh were the new ones there 
uh-huh 
um-hum 
well now um now they may be the demonstrator models but that the sales reps drive around in 
um-hum 
and then the cadillac is is definitely a used car 
or 
yeah 
uh-huh 
it was in eighty eight the guy said it 'd been on the lot about thirty minutes 
he says it 'll probably be gone in a day 
and it 's probably gone by now 
oh no 
those things go fast 
uh-huh 
um of course we- we 're not we can n't consider getting a brand new cadillac because those are twenty twenty five to thirty thousand dollars 
yeah 
but when they 're three years old they 're 
the price already drops in half 
um-hum 
so then it becomes uh more realistic 
right 
that 's what i 'm thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because my last two cars are brand new or do i want to look for a used car that 's maybe two three years old that 's in you know low mileage and in good shape 
uh-huh 
yeah 
but i just i kind of worry about getting a car that 's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it 
is it a lemon 
or is something wrong with it 
that 's right 
but i guess that 's a risk you have to take 
that 's right 
well you can reduce that risk by uh having the car checked out 
i mean you know y- y- if you 're going to look at fifty different cars you do n't want to do this but if you 've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they do n't have any financial interest in it 
um-hum 
um-hum 
um-hum 
right 
and then you 'll have a realistic assessment of what you 're getting 
um-hum 
about how much do they charge to do something like that 
do you know 
oh i 'm thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars 
yeah 
that 's not bad 
no 
huh-uh 
it 'd be well worth it if you 're considering buying a car 
i- i would i would think so 
to find out 
yeah 
yeah 
well it 's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago 
and i 
is n't that a good feeling 
yes 
i do n't want to think about buying a car for a while 
i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and uh you know hang on to the one i 've got for a few years because it 's it 's it 's almost four years old 
that 's right 
but it 's still in great shape 
i have a mazda rx7 
well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for for three or four years and when you 're ready to get another car just pay cash for it 
um-hum 
yeah 
i just about could really because i think my car 
yeah 
if i continue taking good care of it it 's going to hold a pretty good resale value and uh that if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i should n't have too much trouble at all 
oh yeah 
um-hum yeah 
i wou- i would think that 's true 
could you hold on for just a moment 
sure 
okay 
okay i 'm on a cordless phone 
and i was picking up uh some background noise 
so i just switched the channel up on it 
i did n't want to interfere with whatever they 're trying to record 
right 
right 
that 's fine 
so anyway 
but uh i really i really enjoy the car i have now 
and i do want to hold onto it and and uh you know enjoy it while it 's it 's not having any mechanical problems whatso- 
that 's right 
in fact it never has and uh it 's been kind of nice 
that 's right 
and i surprisingly enough after four years i 'm not tired of the car at all 
and um i 'll just hang on to it while it 's still being a good car and while i 'm not tired of it and while i 'm single and can handle a two seater for now and get that out of my system 
well 
yeah 
yeah that 's right 
that 's right 
because one of these days i 'll be getting a six seater probably too 
eventually 
so 
yeah 
the first two cars i ever bought um well uh i 've 
i 've bought three cars 
and i 've i 've always bought them new 
um 
the first car i kept for thirteen and a half years and got a hundred and sixty one thousand out of it 
um-hum wow 
um-hum 
the second car i ever bought i drive to work now 
that just turned ten years old 
and i 've got a hundred and twenty two thousand miles on that 
um-hum 
so that that 's kind of been the way i 've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever 
um-hum 
but uh my car is is using two quarts of oil a week now 
oh my gosh 
about about a quart every hundred miles 
oh no 
so uh but uh but i mean it runs fine 
all you have 
it 's just very thirsty 
um-hum yeah 
if i just keep the oil in it seems to be okay 
but you know that 's that 's a sign that i 'm going to have to do something sooner or later 
right 
what kind of car is it 
it 's a a buick century 
um-hum 
are you going to trade it in on this new one 
or 
uh no 
my fiance is selling uh a nineteen seventy eight cutlass supreme that she has 
it 's actually in better condition than my car 
okay 
uh-huh 
and so she 's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low 
um-hum 
so she 's going to sell it rather than trade it in 
yeah 
that 's probably the best thing 
um y- you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in 
or maybe more than that as i 've learned 
oh really 
yeah 
when i bought my rx7 i uh best offer i got for my other car was twenty five hundred 
well i turned around and sold it myself for forty two hundred 
so 
oh there you go 
you can do much better 
i 'm glad you 're you 're taking care of it yourself 
i- i think trading it in they they just use that as additional 
they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you 're buying 
but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in 
well that 's fact 
that 's what i think 
so 
i think you 're right 
but strangely enough the best off- i mean the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price trade in 
interesting 
but it 's a place in arlington 
and i think maybe as you get outside the dallas area 
i kind of 
i bet you it 's kind of what i decided 
well maybe because it 's outside of dallas they are giving a little bit better prices 
plus i was going through the that ti fleet discount program 
um-hum the okay 
did y- did you use it the car shop place 
um well it 's before they had that 
oh okay 
i had gone over to texins 
and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program 
that 's right 
yeah 
and and what you could expect they said you know a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything 
right 
right 
so i figured out a price based on that 
yeah 
that 's good 
but i- i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the town north mazda right off central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was going to be able to get it for in arlington and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the and the cruise control 
uh-huh 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
he said you 're going to get a car that 's got flood damage or hail damage 
and they just laughed at me 
and i went the next morning to arlington 
and they gave it to me for that price 
and what 's so funny 
is they took the car they i knew they were going to pull it from town north because that 's where the white one was 
is that right 
and they had already told me we located one at town north 
so it was that same car 
my gosh 
and i said like yeah 
well unless you 're selling car with hail damage and flood damage i got the car off your lot for that price 
and y- and you laughed all the way to the bank 
oh i did 
and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup and uh that they required you to do 
uh-huh 
and i took it to town north 
and sure enough i saw that guy 
and he recognized me 
yeah 
he s- he said oh hi dana 
and he kind of looked down and saw that car 
and i- and i 'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day of course when when the place in arlington went and took the car because i told him there 's a place in arlington that 's going to give it to me for that price 
yeah 
yeah that 's right 
he said no they 're not 
yeah 
and the next day they pulled the white car and took it to arlington 
so i 'm sure he knew 
such a deal 
so i loved it 
i sat there 
and i just had the biggest grin on my face 
i 'll bet you did 
is kind of nice 
well dana it 's been really interesting 
and i appreciate talking with you 
but yeah 
good talking to you too don 
okay 
you have a good evening 
okay 
good luck in your car hunting 
thank you much 
uh-huh 
bye-bye 
bye 
well i have n't heard anything about the proposal myself 
but uh uh i do n't know if its their proposal or one 's being seriously kicked around 
no 
i have n't either 
i 've i 've always felt for a long time that i i think that all young kids ought to do a stint uh primarily in the military 
yeah 
uh 
most countries require that now 
they you know they have uh it 's mandatory for for th- the at least the young men 
a lot of yeah 
mo- 
um-hum 
i do n't know about the young women 
if they have to serve in the military too 
yeah 
a lot 
a yeah 
well you take israel i mean everybody does 
a lot of li- yeah 
i do n't think it 's a bad idea 
teaches teaches a lot 
i mean i went in the service when i was eighteen and uh stayed in for ten years 
uh-huh 
is that right 
yeah 
uh did a lot of growing up 
i bet 
you ha- you had to 
yeah 
yeah 
my father had been in the military 
i did n't do it myself 
but my father had 
and that 's uh how he put himself through school basically 
yeah 
because he came from a poor immigrant family 
and he did n't have a chance to um you know 
the parent was n't parent was n't wealthy 
so he had to uh do something to put himself through school 
do it himself 
and he d- and he did 
and he was very successful 
yeah well my parents wanted to send me to college 
and i was dead set against it 
you know i had wanderlust you know 
yes 
and i got in 
and after after wasting the first six years uh partying and everything else i decided uh-huh time to settle down and do something 
so i started to work on my education 
yeah 
course my job was such that i did n't i could n't do it as much as i wanted and still i ended up going two semesters when i got out just to get my degree 
uh-huh 
that 's pretty good 
but i been in school ever since 
that 's good 
yeah 
i guess 
yeah 
that 's uh 
i know 
th- there 's other kinds of service for the country that could be done you know 
yeah 
i mean if you do n't like 
uh working in the national parks uh working cleaning up the roadsides i mean there 's lots of i mean i 've always felt that uh people who are on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time not not all the time because that that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job but at least some of their time to look for to go out and clean up the roads and you know 
the sure 
exactly 
oh yeah 
abso- absolutely 
i mean 
all these all the all this money that we 're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we 're paying all these welfare recipients 
and if they 're able-bodied people i do n't see any problem at all having them go out there and and if nothing else get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards and paint the houses 
yeah 
yeah 
we 'd learn service to other people in this country 
sure 
sure 
so- i 
mean get something out of that money 
you know and and the country would benefit 
yeah 
i- 
i mean uh 
i- 
i 
my next door neighbor when i was growing up worked for the unemployment division 
and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied 
and 
is that right 
yeah 
and he he had all kinds of horror stories 
you know these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks 
and back back in those days they also used to give you a uh booklets good for uh clothing and gas and things like this 
yeah 
and they 'd get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know 
yeah yeah 
and i 'm i ju- i have a hard time dealing with that 
what i hear one time i think it was no paul harvey 's uh uh radio segment that he said that if the money tha- that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in in the government bureaucracy each person would receive like forty five thousand dollars 
um-hum 
i mean i was astounded 
i do n't even make that 
yeah no 
i know 
i i- you you you think about you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient 
yeah 
and somebody 's taking that away 
and and there 's there 's probably there 's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy 
yeah 
no doubt 
you know it 's it 's it 's totally ridiculous 
i mean i i uh i uh started out when i first got in graduate school i was going into uh public administration 
and i quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just could n't stand it any- 
is that right 
yeah 
i mean this is the kind of thing you look at 
yeah 
uh you sit there 
and when you 're writing up budgets you wonder okay how much money do we need 
well you need x number dollars for the recipients 
but you need x number dollars to administer the program 
i 'm going this is ridiculous 
yeah 
this is ridiculous 
it it 's sad 
it is 
it 's pathetic 
i mean there 's got to be a different way 
there 's got to be a better way 
but it 'll never happen 
i mean these these people out here getting that money are are big voting blocks 
yeah 
w- yeah 
what would happen uh if if this country required young people to do service the country 
what what should they get in return i wonder 
like uh 
i think i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as uh 
and i would limit it strictly to something like t- uh tuition assistance 
yeah 
uh give an incentive 
educational or vocational training or something 
yeah 
someth- something that 's going to help them along the way 
and that 'll help the country eventually too because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people 
sure 
i mea- 
well this 
i mean i mean y- look a- look at the statistics 
and that 's only going to help 
i mean it 's sad 
one in five americans can n't read or adults that is can n't even read 
yeah 
and and we 've got the lowest rates of civilized countries in science and math 
yeah 
i mean what are we what are we becoming 
we 're becoming a service country 
a- as opposed to what we were twenty years ago 
yeah 
we were an industrial giant 
and now we 're not we 're not going to do it because everybody is is beating us at the game 
we taught them how to do it 
and they they did it better than we do 
yeah 
simple as that 
because they have the ambition i guess 
yeah 
it 's simple as that 
and 
that you know which is good for them 
but on the other hand we kind of lose out 
yeah 
it 's terrible for us 
i think that if uh young people had service the country might give them more ambition because it you know th- they learn that serving other people is a is a good thing 
yeah 
yeah 
and an- it can be good for them too 
yeah 
oh yeah 
i mean e- even the the greedy kids that we 've got now 
oh gosh you go to the mall 
and you see you know fourteen year old kids flaunting money because their parents give them money to go down and play video games all night you know for what 
you know yeah i know 
i know 
give me the money 
and i 'll i 'll teach you something good 
a- well you know you know you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house 
yeah 
yeah 
th- that that 's my other complaint 
parents are n't parents anymore 
no 
they 've they 've relinquished their parenting 
yeah 
one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble 
yeah 
well as a substitute teacher for a year i can i can say yes 
yeah 
i mean i talked with somebody else about that another time 
and you know uh when i was uh in graduate school working on my master 's degree uh in math i was uh teaching as part of my part of the program 
and i just love teaching 
that was a lot o- that was probably the most fun i had 
and uh it it helped me out because i learned things and learned how to do things differently 
um-hum yeah 
hm 
and when uh when i come time to get out of school i thought boy i 'd like to teach 
but you know for for what 
um-hum yeah 
you know i do n't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life 
exactly 
i mean th- that 's a sad thing to say 
because that 's kind of selfish on my part 
and and i admit that 
well in a way it is 
but y- but you have to look out for yourself you know 
yeah 
that 's right 
i mean that 's someth- 
b- and and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers 
that 's wrong 
yeah 
gosh 
i mean 
i 'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less 
i 'm saying teachers should be paid more 
no 
i mean uh yeah 
they uh they do an absolutely necessary job 
i mean i i ad- i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that 
yeah 
um but uh i mean there there 's a there 's a sense of priorities here too 
yeah 
you know we need 
t- what 's more important picking up the garbage or educating our kids 
yeah 
they both have their place 
yeah 
they 
sure 
but but you know when it gets right down to it 
i mean one 's import- 
i mean on the other hand i mean you take a garbage man in new york city 
starts out at twenty six thousand dollars 
that 's pretty good 
well i 'll bet you there 're a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year 
yeah 
yeah um i mean that my other pet peeve is unions 
yeah 
yeah oh yeah 
you know i- it 's just it 's it 's ridiculous the way unions have gone 
i mean there w- there was a time when unions were needed 
and they served a good function 
and they served a good function 
but but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated 
and they 're only there to perpetuate their own their own power structure 
yeah i remember m- the company my dad worked for uh the people there went on a strike against against the m- uh management 
an- uh it was a steel manufacturing place 
and they uh th- this was during a time when uh import steel was so cheap and they were having a hard time 
and they told the strikers there look we need you to come back and get this stuff done 
or else we 're going to be out of business 
and they would n't come back 
so they went bankrupt 
yeah 
and and they all lost their jobs 
sure 
and tha- and tha- and and that 's that 's really what happened to the steel industry in this country 
and it 's like you know 
yeah 
so many times i mean you had the uh the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time 
and uh well that took care of that industry now and then and and i 'll tell you 
yeah that 's right 
detroit worked awfully hard on on stopping car manufacturing in this country 
and they 're trying to do that now with the imports 
yeah 
i mean you know w- we 've never caught up 
and i do n't think we ever will 
it 'll be a tough road to 
um yeah 
i mean here it is 
i mean we 've got to we 've got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars 
hoe yeah yeah yeah 
yeah 
and they only did it because they i guess they 're embarrassed tha- that they 're so good at it 
yeah 
that 's about right 
gosh 
yeah 
well i 'm back to the original subject 
yeah 
i i think i think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service 
i i do n't care what kind it is 
it teach them teaches them uh pride in their country 
yeah 
and pride in themselves too 
that 's right 
they they can they can uh i mean you could organize something just within your community 
yeah 
yeah sa- same old thing 
i mean 
that 's right 
that 's uh that 's the that 's like eagle scouts 
if sure 
um-hum 
you know they have like that and that 's a great idea 
i i think they ought to take them and uh and i do n't know just have sort of like a uh a a manpower pool and say okay look we need somebody 
all right 
oh okay 
are you on an exercise program now 
or 
yeah 
i exercise pretty regularly 
uh-huh 
i lift weights quite a bit 
uh-huh 
um i run occasionally 
let 's see what else do i do play golf some 
and i work out on a a hanging bag 
i 'm brown belt in karate 
so i keep up with that a little bit 
uh-huh 
oh yeah 
how about you 
um the only exercise program i 'm doing right now is walking 
um-hum 
i 've got a nine month old 
and i 'm four months pregnant with my second 
and so at the time walking seems to be the best 
it 's something i can do with her plus um does n't tax me too physically 
um-hum 
i have enjoyed aerobics in the past 
and i enjoy that because i like the group association you know like exercising with other people 
um-hum yeah 
and um and that 's my favorite way to exercise 
well that 's neat 
yeah 
i do walk some too 
my wife 's about five months along so she 's been walking quite a bit 
but oh 
so that that is a good exercise for that 
yeah 
it 's it- it 's nice to do it together too i guess 
um-hum 
because my husband and i used to walk together 
but our schedules do n't coincide as well as they used to 
and so we very seldom get together to walk 
but when you when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule 
or do you go to groups 
or 
i- i- i do it on my own schedule 
um-hum 
we used to try and belong to clubs or the y stuff like that 
but it so difficult to go on a regular basis to d- to drive the distance you have to go 
um-hum 
and save the fees 
we 've decided we just save the fees an- and buy some of our own equipment 
so 
and then you can do it whenever you want i guess 
yeah 
yeah i 've got a weight bench 
and we got my wife an exercise bike 
and i use that sometimes too 
um-hum 
so it 's a little more convenient 
but you 're i guess you 're not as dedicated if you do n't drive over do it 
i guess it depends on the person depends on how motivated you are 
um-hum 
because my husband used to work out three days a week with uh at the texas instruments gym 
uh-huh 
and then i would just go on saturdays 
but since the first of the year neither one of us have been going 
yeah 
so you know like you said we 've been paying these fees and not going 
so it 's kind of a a waste of money if you do n't take advantage of it 
yeah 
i i think you really have to be disciplined 
yeah 
i uh i i try to work out a- at least a couple of times a week 
and i i think you really have to at least twice a week just to maintain the shape that you 're in 
yeah 
oh with the walking i think they they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial 
um-hum 
and we i have two friends that we walk 
they have babies that are about the same age as as mine 
and we 've been walking every morning at going 
when it was cold we 'd go to the mall it 's because you can n't take the babies out very easily 
yeah 
so uh so we when we go we have about do about fifteen miles a week 
but the last little while for one the reason or another we have n't been real consistent 
so it 's a little harder when you depending on other people to do it with you because you have to meet their schedules as well 
um-hum 
but but i enjoy doing it more when i 've got other people with me 
true 
than and i usually do it because i want to because i know it 's good for me not because you know i do n't i do n't feel obligated to do it 
and i enjoy it 
if i if i feel too obligated to do it 
i i start to rebel 
and i wo n't be as consistent with it 
um-hum yeah 
i understand 
did you exercise between your first child and your second 
i uh i exercised pretty well up until i found or -til i was pregnant 
and i started having pains 
so i 've calmed down everything except i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the um walking 
um-hum yeah 
and i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful 
but the the ti rec center has an aerobics program for for um prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing 
hm 
and i was going to wait until um about my sixth month and then start doing that 
i did that with the second baby 
and um i went to my exer- cl- -cise class one day 
and then she was delivered the next day 
gosh 
so i- it would seem to be real beneficial 
um-hum 
yeah 
maybe it maybe it speeded up the process and all that 
well i think it made parts of it a lot easier 
i- i is this your first that you 're having 
uh-huh 
oh okay 
well then i do n't know how much you 've been through it 
but um i think parts of it made a lot easier 
and i 've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and did n't with the other 
and they said that they 'd ex- the one that had exercised was three or four times easier 
really 
an- and we 've i had 
having both of them natural the first one was natural and going natural the second 
and and it was it 's rough 
but it 's not a- as bad as i thought it would be 
and i think the exercise helped 
um-hum well that 's good 
so do you work with ti 
no 
i do n't 
my my wife has been working with them 
oh okay 
well then she could go if she was interested 
um-hum 
i think that 's what the class that meets on saturday mornings 
so she could find out if she wanted to go 
it 's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy 
and they would talk about exercise and just general things related to the birthing process 
and so for it 's so it 's educational as well as it e- exercise beneficial 
so 
yeah at least its something that you enjoy 
and i know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say well i do n't want to exercise it 's too much work 
but there a lot of different things you can do that that are enjoyable that you do n't have to you know strain yourself or sweat be real sore afterwards 
that 's right 
yeah 
and sometimes that 's if you get a little soreness you feel like well i 've done a good job because i got worked myself to that point 
but i guess you do n't want to overdue 
but well have we reached our limit 
i 'm not sure how long we 've been talking 
but 
yeah 
i thi- i think we 've talked about six minutes or so 
okay 
well it 's been good talking to you 
so it 's been good talking to you as well 
okay 
i hope your baby goes well comes out well 
thanks 
your- yours too 
bye-bye 
bye-bye 
i do n't know um 
do you do a lot of camping 
well my husband and i have n't done a whole lot of camping 
we but we bought a van last year 
yeah 
and we were hoping to to do some camping in the van um 
we did go camping in arkan- not arkansas oklahoma 
uh last year in we camped in a tent 
and uh there were two other couples with us 
and there was uh state park 
oh so 
and it was really nice 
yeah 
um up here some of the state parks are really nice 
and some of them are n't 
some of them are pretty rough 
really 
um yeah 
they they just have like outhouses 
they do n't have like a shower room or anything 
yeah 
but some of them are really nice 
they have showers and full bathrooms 
um 
um but i do n't know 
i i 've been camping a couple times 
but i 'm not a real avid camper uh 
a lot of people i know are 
but um i do n't i do n't 
i i do n't like really camping in the rough 
i like the the the little niceties like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that 
know that yeah 
in fact we went we went once to a lean-to 
and it um 
i mean there was n't any electricity on the camp site 
but it was all right 
but we only spent two nights there 
i would n't want to spend more than two nights 
i would n't want to go for like a week 
but um two nights is good 
yeah 
that would that would be much 
um especially there was a little store close by 
so it was pretty nice 
yeah 
the campsite that we went to was an area that 
it 's right on a big lake 
and there 's a lot of boating out there 
and we we went up there uh to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit 
but it was still uh it was still too cold 
oh really 
oh 
yeah 
it it was pretty early in the year 
um yeah 
up here you got to wait till au- august till the water warms up 
yeah 
well it 's not that bad 
but it 's still pretty chilly 
um i do n't know 
i was i have a tent 
and i slept out in it in the backyard and stuff 
but the th- thing about camping that bothers me is you 've got to pack everything 
and another thing is the thing seems to get 
it 's dirty you know 
yeah 
so you can n't keep the dirt out of the tent 
and i do n't know 
we have a seven year old 
it 's pretty funny 
like stay out 
yeah 
we we have a we have a dog 
and that 's just about as bad as a kid 
yeah 
boy he he does n't go in and out of the tent a hundred times 
um-hum 
and use it as a play uh 
they they like to play in them 
yeah 
i do n't know how you can really keep uh the inside of a tent clean 
yeah 
i do n't know 
other other than you know taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and and sweeping it out everyday it 's really hard to to keep the sand and dirt out of it 
yeah 
well w- what we were doing we were just going to say we 're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night so you know no going in and out and or what what he wants to do 
we had brought his friend along was play in the tent 
it was like no this is not working 
you can n't do that 
you get tent all dirty 
did 
plus you get it all wet 
because we were at a beach site too 
um-hum 
um did you have another a big tent like uh um for like a looks like a sitting area type you know like a two room type 
n- no 
but you know i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because th- they are really nice 
and um up here we have uh we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime 
tent yeah 
yeah 
we do n't really have a problem with that um in these areas um 
and ev- even when in oklahoma when we camped i really did n't notice a problem with bugs 
and i noticed that 
i know that i said that 's 
i 've i 've lived back east before um and 
yeah they 're terrible 
they 're really terrible 
uh but there is this one campsite that it 
that some of them are known 
that there is one that 's out in this big lake 
and it 's it 's it 's mosquitoes are terrible 
and then this uh there 's this other one that 's more up in the mountains 
but it surrounds a man-made reservoir 
and there 's no bugs 
that 's the whole thing that everyone told me oh 
i 'm i was going to go to little little river state park 
they go oh that place is great 
there 's no bugs 
hum 
but oh 
okay 
because uh we were having a b- a really big problem up here in certain areas 
we were really affected that bad but really bad it um 
almost destroyed the the tourism in one town because of the mosquitoes 
they 're so bad 
really 
yeah 
that was it 's a really nice area 
i 've been there before 
and it 's 
i i could n't imagine ge- living just sixty miles north of them 
but they were plagued they were plagued with them with mosquitoes 
and you can go out outside in the daytime all right 
but the minute the sun went down that 's when it seems like the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out 
hum 
i mean just the very second 
it 's really strange 
they uh they must uh work on that you know 
the the it gets cooler when the sun sets 
and then they all come out 
well have you ever have you ever taken any of those um what do they call this citronella lights 
have you ever used those 
oh oh yeah 
yeah 
i never really noticed how effective they were 
but um because that was n't really 
i- i bought them and 
i did n't really get to use them like oh there 's mosquitoes let 's turn them 
on we just sort of lit them 
um-hum 
and um we were n't bothered that much by mosquitoes 
so we did n't really contribute it to that 
but um i think in an area that 's really thick with mosquitoes 
i can n't see all this little uh smoke buckets i call them 
yeah 
how they work 
but they they 're suppose to work really well 
hum 
oh i 'm in my paperwork here 
that 's what i do when i wait for a phone call 
i get in my paperwork oh to find my most important parts 
but i do n't know i do n't know if i 'm going to go 
g- i wish i was an avid camper 
and i could really talk about like gardening or something 
i can talk about that a lot 
um-hum 
but um i do want to go again 
we just moved to a new hou- into a house 
so i do n't see camping 
maybe in the backyard 
but i do n't see going on a camping trip probably till next summer 
yeah 
i 'd i 'd like to go camping cross country um 
i just got married less than two years ago 
so we do n't have any any children yet um 
so it 's easy for you to go 
and yeah 
so it 's easy to pick up and go and s- 
we have a van 
and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it 
um oh god 
so it 's it 's not really i guess camping the way peop- most people picture camping in the tent 
but 
i do n't know 
but that sounds like my k- my kind of camping it really does 
yeah 
okay um well um 
tha- that is the best way to do it is to have a a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent 
yeah 
or or get 
my brother has a real nice pop-up 
yep 
and he just he just tows it behind his truck 
um 
and he he 's got three kids 
so his kids 'll sleep in the truck in the in the back of the bed 
um and they sleep in the pop-up 
well those they 're kind of nice 
but they 're also um flimsy when you really look at them 
but then when you get inside they 're really nice you know 
yeah 
everything 's really 
but then when you look underneath it it 's just got these little wheels and this just this uh little axle 
it 's like oh my 
and then a big windstorm it would pick you up 
yeah 
he did have a problem uh when he went camping last year in uh beavers bend o- o- ok- oklahoma um 
a s- a storm came in 
and it started raining really heavy 
and they were all everybody was trying to flee the campsite 
and everybody was getting stuck in the mud 
oh jeez 
and the 
yeah 
what do you what do you do when you get a i mean like a really violent storm like a tornado 
just stay in your truck 
i i mean i would n't stay in the um 
well theirs was so bad 
and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up 
oh 
and they had to get out of there 
so d- were they successful 
yeah 
they yeah they were 
but it took them a little while 
but yeah 
they they decided that that was enough camping for the weekend 
yeah 
so did they get stuck 
no 
they ended up getting out 
they ended up helping several other people though that were that were stuck 
yeah huh 
wow so they evacuated it 
yeah 
yeah 
they the whole the whole campsite was evacuated 
wow 
i mean some i think some people that had fairly sturdy um vehicles or whatever if they had like a winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water i think they stayed 
yeah 
but everybody that was real close to the water ended up 
it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream 
i know i i always i like to like to get right on the water 
yeah 
where the campsite i- so 
yeah 
i- w- like i do n't know we have lean-to 's up here 
i really like them 
like they say they 're kind of it 's kind of more dirty than anything you know 
just just 
they have them right at the campsites 
yeah 
they 're they 're lean-to 's 
they 're um yeah they 're pretty nice 
wow 
they 're they 're uh it 's like a little house except the whole face is open 
and the one time that we went we got one 
it was overlooking the water 
but it was a big embankment 
i wanted to get one right on the water 
that was then when we had uh an electrical storm too 
and it was really it was neat sitting there watching it 
i mean it was raining 
when we called in home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm 
good morning 
good morning 
uh okay 
go ahead 
no 
no 
go ahead 
yeah 
i understand the topic this morning is uh our policy in latin america and you know what we 've been doing down there 
so uh as you indicated you do n't have too much input into the area 
it it just so happens that uh our daughter-in-law is panamanian 
and uh we have been in panama 
and i have worked in el salvador 
and we visit mexico occasionally 
so yeah 
we we do have a little information on it here 
but uh 
oh very good 
because actually um when i was in college i visited mexico several times 
i was in the peace corps and um peru 
oh uh-huh 
but but recently i have been following the middle east rather than central america 
yeah 
it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit 
that 's that 's for sure 
no 
i 
the us policy uh towards central america as far as uh 
well i kind of go back to to the el salvador thing because texas instruments had a a plant down there for a while 
and i worked in there for a little while 
and at that particular time 
let 's let 's see 
that was seventy three seventy four kind of before the the uh the the uh the civil war really picked up down there 
and us policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to uh to the government itself you know 
anything that 's that 's anticommunist you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro 
right 
it do n't matter what their excesses were 
and i believe at the time that i was down there that uh the government uh the salvadorian government you know really gotten out of hand yet 
the uh right wing death squad type situation 
i believe that that was beginning to form 
but i do n't i i was n't really aware of it 's being you know terribly uh you know rapid at the time that that i was down there 
i think that really kind of developed a little bit later on 
but uh our policies seem to be pretty much one of uh you know trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource anyway that salvador had plenty of 
and that was people 
right 
we did n't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it 's it 's labor 
um-hum 
because everything that ti did anyway we we shipped in 
and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here 
so 
did that have 
i did n't feel that we really ex- exploiting them any 
um so you do n't you do n't feel that that we were um exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting 
and they were n't 
no uh 
in the particular incidence that i was aware of now ti was n't the only ones in there 
playtex was in 
there was uh several other companies 
uh-huh 
and uh of course we kind of concentrate 
there was n't much to take out of the country 
felt like we 're going in and taken all their um their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that 
um-hum 
because uh it just 
the only thing that they had a great abundance of was uh you know human beings 
uh-huh 
di- did we tend to um change their attitu- attitudes 
like some times when americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt american things americanism um consumer products tv the whole works 
yeah 
i understand what you say 
there was a uh 
the time that i was down there i stayed quite a a bit at the uh uh one of the big hotels san salvador 
and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against american tourists because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious as a as a group 
and i saw this in panama also 
uh-huh 
uh oh you know it 's it 's the uh the almost stereotype you know 
flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck you know demanding this that and the other thing you know 
we 're we 're here 
and we want this 
and we want that 
and that sort of thing 
that 's that 's the stereotype that 's very strong down there you know 
that uh the you know that sort of 
i i i believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for you know the local uh culture 
i really do n't believe that we were quite that bad 
but yet they were having to deal directly with uh you know with the uh the local people 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
and uh but boy 
there is a there is a bad uh uh you know the old brash ugly american type situation 
uh-huh 
and i saw incidences in the hotel where i just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say oh my god 
those are those are not americans 
they can n't be 
right 
but they are 
and uh of course now i i do have to i remember one case where we had some canadians in there who were every bit as bad 
but i mean it i think it 's just kind of the north american situation uh 
in in panama they 've been used to americans down there for so darn long 
but i did n't see quite as much of that sort of thing as panamanians are just about as as uh as jaded as americans as far as uh creature comforts you know 
they 're uh they 're they 're every bit uh 
i i know when my my son was in the air force 
and he was stationed in panama 
and he married a panamanian girl 
and when she came up here uh you know 
she 's y- kn- except for the language situation some of the cultures she 's just about an american you know is as far as tv and and you know the the moneymaking part of it and all that 
uh-huh 
matter of fact if anything she 's worse 
uh-huh 
uh-huh 
but uh uh it just there 's little enclaves down there where you know americans have a lot of influence 
and the local population kind of um you know sort of accepts that 
but i 've also seen the other side of it too 
uh-huh 
well you were in peru 
yeah 
i was in peru 
but um i there were n't as i recall or at least i was n't aware of that many americans there except for a very heavy concentration of peace corps volunteers 
uh-huh 
this was when the peace corps first are started 
uh-huh 
and it was one of the big targets 
and um i do n't i do n't think at that time at least peace corps was uh an obnoxious group in the sense that that we were very controlled regarding number of days off 
and and you could n't just take up take off and leave your group and go explore and and things like that 
oh 
uh-huh 
but and i was working actually in the savings and loan program 
so that was quite specialized 
although i was living in the slums i was really working with the middle class 
uh-huh 
what uh what area did you live in 
i was up in arequipa 
oh okay 
yeah 
and um 
i 've heard of it 
uh-huh 
so 
well well is are they is peace corps still active down in there 
i do n't have any idea um 
probably not 
i mean there were thir- i was uh per- peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine that had gone in 
uh-huh 
and and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development 
and they were building schools and doing coops and things like that 
health um inoculation and and things 
oh has those influences lasted 
do you know whether the the things that that you and your groups before you did did those did those live on 
or were they reabsorbed 
or how 
no 
no 
i believe they did 
because um some of some of the the peace corps uh that i knew of did marry peruvians and have been back 
uh-huh 
and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things 
and of course the savings and loan program um that was that you know that that just continued to grow 
in fact after my group 
i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread 
and then of course peace corps bowed out of that because that 's uh uh something that nationalized very quickly 
uh-huh 
and the same with the coops 
well that 's that was kind of the the aim was n't it to get it started and then have it taken up by the 
right 
oh okay 
oh so you know well that 's 
i had wondered sometimes 
i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort 
and a lot of work went into a lot of that 
and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know 
like yeah 
uh-huh 
yeah 
i 've you know some of the programs i would have concern about like um the language teaching you know 
i mean why should we push english 
uh-huh 
and a lot of people were down there teaching english 
and when they talked about hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting peace corps to teach language you know to me that 's a little bit marginal 
i did teach economics at the university one night a week 
and the textbook was in english 
but basically i taught it in spanish because i mean i really did n't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test 
oh 
yeah 
my brother-in-law teaches at uh northern illinois university 
and they were in china here a couple of years ago 
and he was over there at uh the university of shah and and teaching 
okay charles uh 
gun control 
what are you uh for 
in favor or no comment 
i 'm very much in favor of gun control 
oh you are 
yes 
i am 
well this should be very interesting because i 'm against it 
i do n't i do n't mind people owning guns 
i just think it should be a little you know a little a little more regulated 
well you know uh now he- here 's something that uh first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic uh weapons 
yes 
uh now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons 
i believe that 's correct 
uh-huh 
and yet their uh the gun control enthusiasts are are uh preaching about the gun control and how they should be ha- we should have stronger laws and what not 
um-hum 
i do n't understand why we do n't enforce the laws we have 
that would certainly help 
i 'm sure 
now this is not just a state law 
this is a federal law controlled by the treasury department uh for fully automatic weapons 
um-hum 
yep 
um-hum 
and uh all right 
now for instance in california where they passed the uh uh semi automatic or or uh 
um-hum 
now what was it they called them 
the military version attack weapons or something 
yeah 
right 
uh-huh 
uh h- how is that going to affect the uh sports weapons i mean rifles that are automatic or semi automatic 
um-hum 
yep 
i really do n't have any problem jack with you know uh people using firearms for sporting purposes 
i do n't have any pro- 
the only thing i- 
i am in favor of the seven day waiting period 
i would like to see that see that happen 
i 
uh-huh 
well now uh i 've got to admit i 'm inclined to agree with you there uh even though i am a member of the nra 
um-hum 
um-hum 
and they are again- they 
their reason being that well if you let one little law get through pretty soon one 's going to stack up on top of another and so forth and so on 
right 
yeah 
i understand that 
and you 've got to admit that congress does kind of look at things that way 
um-hum 
that 's true 
i i like i say i do n't have any problem with people using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes 
i just think it 's just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one on on a whim of some sort 
uh that that 's true 
uh now did you hear about the the control that they have up in virginia 
i 'm not sure i have 
uh it it 's it 's a little hard to believe 
but they can uh of course 
like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law 
anyone ever convicted of a a felony is can not purchase a weapon 
um-hum 
and they do n't have a waiting period because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons 
um-hum 
and the uh 
when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in uh uh virginia the salesman just calls some number and uh punches in your name 
and if it comes up negative okay 
fine 
and you get your gu- your gun right then and there 
i see 
uh but they are the only state that does it 
hm that 's interesting 
and uh according to virginia it did n't cost all that much 
um-hum 
and frankly i- i do n't understand why a state does n't have those records available anyway 
yeah 
uh uh at least uh records of of uh known felons which are available to local police departments 
yeah 
you would think they would 
um-hum 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
i 'm surprised that more states does n't do that 
uh uh uh certainly those those records are available 
um-hum 
and all they would have to do is expand it to uh uh well connect them into a modem somehow 
yeah 
right 
um-hum 
i would n't think it 'd be that difficult to do 
well virginia is not a particularly rich state 
and they managed to fi- squeak out a few bucks to do it 
yep 
right 
and uh it 's uh uh one hundred percent successful 
hm that 's interesting 
yeah 
i just heard about this last week 
uh they were bragging about it 
yeah 
with uh uh 
they should have have pride in this because it 's it 's a good system and it 's working well 
absolutely 
yeah 
i agree 
and they do n't need that seven day waiting period because the whole idea of that waiting period was so that uh it uh the police could check up on you 
uh-huh 
yep 
well you know what 's going to happen there 
those files are going to back up on somebody 's desk 
just a that typical bureaucratic work 
um-hum 
that 's another uh uh thorn in my side bureaucratics politicians 
uh-huh 
yeah 
right 
i agree 
yep 
right 
i was just thinking there 's 
so anyway well we seem to be one in favor and one against 
yeah 
i guess that 's about right 
although neither one of us are are uh really uh uh dyed in the wool 
uh yeah 
uh we but we both 
i 'm not totally rigid on the subject 
i just think there should be 
you know should n't be quite so easy to do 
well there should be some way of checking 
uh-huh 
now here in in texas uh all you need is a driver 's license 
right 
um-hum 
and uh even felons can still get a driver 's license 
sure 
so i- i do n't think they are too 
well they 're not rigid enough here in texas 
yeah 
that 's true 
but do n't tell the nra i said that 
i wo- 
i promise 
i wo n't 
they 're liable to tear up my membership 
okay 
i promise 
you say you retired a year ago 
yes 
i did 
uh-huh 
i 'm looking forward to it in about a just just over a year myself 
yeah 
i really enjoy it 
uh uh-huh 
i stay pretty busy 
i do quite a not quite a lot i do some uh volunteer work here in plano 
i- i have a few uh handicapped persons that i you know try to do things for help them do 
oh uh-huh 
well uh i bought a motor home here f- four years ago and i have been living in it ever since 
uh-huh 
that 's uh 
and i 'm looking forward to just traveling 
sure 
i can understand that 
i have four sons scattered all over the country and a f- few grandchildren 
um-hum 
yep 
and i 'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them 
that 'd be neat 
sure would 
well charles good luck to you on your 
okay 
nice talking to you 
yeah 
nice talking to you too 
okay 
take care 
take care now 
bye-bye 
bye 
so what kind of weather have you had in dallas 
well it 's been very windy 
and it 's uh probably unseasonably hot for time right now yeah 
really 
yeah 
see i did n't i do n't 
i thought my uh i th- 
i live in euless 
and i thought it was pretty normal 
but anyway but i guess you 're right though it has been real hot 
because it um 
i 've had to use the air conditioner in march 
we 've already had to use that 
and that is 
and we 've had like 
i meant this is probably typical though uh wi- 
like tornado weather and tornado warnings 
and um 
pretty usual uh-huh 
so uh you know i i forget from year to year 
i 'm getting too old 
but the um i- i- th- th- the wind 's blowing very hard 
yeah 
but i guess uh you know we 're just out of march and uh will bring the rain in april 
yeah 
i know 
the trees are real pretty right now and everything 
and uh i do n't know 
i know the pollen is real high 
but i think it 's higher than usual is n't it yeah 
yes 
it is 
seems very high 
it has n't bothered me 
but i know the people that have allergies it seems to be a pretty high 
i know 
it 's been bothering me a lot 
but 
yeah 
i think nor- i think the weather overall has been um probably like you said probably a little bit warm 
and so 
a little bit warm and a little bit uh blowy i think 
anyway 
so we basically live in the same area 
so it 's real hard to 
really hard to make too big of uh different comparisons right 
i know 
yeah 
i just think it 's been warm 
and it 's been hot 
and i like it 
and it 's beautiful 
and all the trees are pretty 
and i wish it would stay like this all the time 
yes 
i could stand this all summer 
so yeah 
i could too 
and uh gah i do n't think we can say anything else really 
i do n't think we can either 
let 's cut off 
yeah 
that sounds like a good deal 
well you have a nice day 
you too 
and we 'll talk to you later 
bye-bye 
bye 
okay 
this topic is is russia a threat to our security 
i think they 're more of a threat to their own people at this day and time 
how do you feel about it 
well they do have uh a major internal problem 
everybody wants to defect 
and i can understand why 
um i think their biggest problem is just you know obtaining food to live 
so when you have the basic needs uh being unmet i do n't think you think globally as far as you know being a threat to other people in the world 
so as soon as they get their their own home country taken care of then they 'll consider what they can do with the rest of the world 
i believe communism is very much waning 
it 's uh pretty much on the way out of the door in so far as the strong hold that they used to have 
and the russian people are all realizing that the communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world 
and their rebellions right now is the result of that 
i- if they can get the army or the military to sway to their side i think that uh it will be on the way out eventually 
it 's just a matter of time because in the baltic states they 've already massacred so many people who protested 
and that has n't set too well with their diplomacy for the regarding the uh outcome of their affairs 
what 's your synopsis 
well i do i do realize that um uh the bush administration is n't too happy with with how they 're handling their internal um strife you know as far as diplomacy is concerned 
i think it 's been a good a good uh positive direction for um the soviets as far as yeltsin is concerned 
you know he was um allowed to 
what wh- 
in his in the in the congress they they gave him more power as far as his republic in russia is concerned which is gives him more power overall which i think is a good sign that there 'll be some you know 
politically speaking you know he 's going to have more power 
and i think it 's a step in the right direction 
i think gorbachev realizes that he 's got a a major uh uh power figure you know competing against him 
and i think it 's going to be pretty close to his demise if he does n't follow suit with yeltsin as far as uh realizing 
well he does realize it you know with the fact that they reduced the uh or they increased the prices on their food food and goods 
uh-huh 
uh it 
i think that it went up a thousand percent on most 
yeah 
tha- that 's incredible 
but they had to um go in the direction of a market driven economy 
and and they had to bite the bullet for that 
so that 's a good move on on gorbachev 's part in doing that 
um-hum 
so 
but gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that he 's moving towards a two to three party system of government that nor eliminating or diminishing the communist power 
and i guess that 's where yeltsin steps in so far as his politics of government goes uh 
but i do n't know how convinced the people are of him yet myself 
well that 's all they got right now 
that 's their ray of hope 
uh-huh 
so you know they 'll go with you know w- whoever comes through for them 
i it it 's just that w- the weird thing is is that gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates as far as with glasnost and perestroika perestroika and stuff 
and i think he 's caught between the old guard and and the new uh glasnost 
um i think it 's kind of uh escalate to a point where it 's out of control 
um-hum 
and i think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how in order to keep the peace on peace on both sides 
so i think that 's where you know kind of where he 's stuck 
you know what i 'm saying 
yeah 
uh i understand 
and that 's the that 's the situation that he finds himself in 
and you know he 's a tough guy 
i mean he 's been through it 
so i have no doubt that he 'll 
i mean y- i i think overall he 's been a a good ah figure for the the soviet union 
i mean i think his intentions and his ideals are are uh well intentioned 
it uh-huh 
and in the long-term 
but i just think that because of the basic needs that the people do n't have 
i think that that makes the problem most severe and makes him look look worse that what his um what his ideals are personally 
i agree 
what 's bad for the soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food 
but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should 
i think it 's i think it 's a lot of uh oh how do you put it bureaucracy and and and uh one thing and then all the corruption 
i think there 's a a a large amount of corruption on the the have and the have nots you know 
yeah 
that 's probably more true than a lot of people realize 
i i know you 're going to have that with every society 
at least we 're more blatant about it 
but it 's very secret 
and it 's been going on for years 
i mean you can n't change things overnight 
uh-huh 
and but if it gets to a point where people can n't survive i mean there 's revolution you know 
and that 's 
it seems to be headed in that direction too 
yeah 
big time 
major 
but you know that 's that 's what happens when you know the cork blows 
and you can n't handle it anymore 
i mean that 's that 's the way the world uh you know revolves that way 
uh-huh 
i really question though how much technology the average soviet is exposed to 
well their knowledge with uh better communication processes in this world now that 's reached them is more educated than to the uh ways of the western world 
and um i think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things to 
they 
probably not enough 
but i 'm sure i lot of it 's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind of what they 're missing out on 
yeah 
i think they 're starting to realize 
but i i just do n't think they have the resources if you were to compare uh the americans to the soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines fax machines and cellular phones and state of the art equipment that we are so used to 
i do n't think they even realize what 's out there and to what extent 
yeah 
i 'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items 
yeah 
all the major conveniences of life 
yeah 
what we consider just i do n't know normal everyday things to them is real luxury which is unfortunate for them 
yeah 
and of course most of us we do n't really appreciate what we 've got because we 've been so used to it 
this is true 
this is very true 
and we 
it 's human it 's human nature though to take things for granted 
and it kind of you know 
when you 've lost something or or uh uh do n't have what other people have that 's when you tend to realize you know what 's out there and what you know what you have and what you do n't have 
yeah 
i agree 
so the original question do we think they 're a threat to our you know a s- s- security threat 
yeah 
um yes and no 
yeah 
i can go with that answer too 
the only yes i could go to is if uh a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching of something to that effect to for to a nuclear exchange 
but i do n't even see that occurring uh because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to i guess 
um no 
well i do n't really feel that the soviets really want to blow up the world 
i mean um we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as as nonfeeling machine type people 
and they 're people just like us 
i mean you know they get up everyday 
uh-huh 
and they put their pants on the same way 
and they have to eat and everything else 
and i just do n't feel that 
okay um 
let 's t- talk about the middle east situation 
the us involvement in i guess even though 
now that it 's all over with you know 
well it is over 
but i do n't think we 're out of there by any means 
and uh and i wonder are we going to set up uh you know peace keeping type forces for long term 
and you know is that something we should do or should n't do 
i do n't know 
it 's i do n't know 
uh i understand that the us talking about leaving more of its planes and things over there 
uh i guess they uh they were anti us in that region 
and now they 're you know 
like syria and uh um egypt you know had some had some pressure against the us 
but now they now and they would n't allow us to have a base in the region 
but now i think they 're rethinking that 
i think that 's true because i think they saw the support that came through 
that 's right 
the other thing that i think is good for like american businesses are to be involved is the the reports that i hear back 
and of course on the news i i try to listen and and also read between the lines you know 
uh-huh 
but uh they said that because the americans you know took such a proactive stance i- involvement in the war that 
like so much of the buil- business and rebuilding kuwait and things like that will go to american businesses where as before they may be dealt with japanese firms or other people 
um-hum 
they said even though the japanese were involved monetarily uh they fill 
like the first first priority ought to go to american businesses which i guess will be good you know which will be good for our economy 
right 
right 
but i you know 
since they ha- get so much of our money for from oil anyway 
when boy 
do n't you know 
i mean we do n't seem to slow down even when there 's a crisis 
no 
no 
but 
um yeah 
i think that 's that 's a nice gesture on the kuwaiti government part to do that 
and uh and a few people i guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth 
i yeah i imagine 
your oil companies they may see a probably the first big rise in business they 've seen in years 
i 'm right 
go over there and rebuild all those 
um-hum 
i think it 's such a shame that iraqis had to just go destroy e- everything 
i was just 
i do too 
i mean what 's what good is that 
i mean if i can n't have it you can n't have it you know 
that sounds like something a little kid would do you know 
yeah 
but look at their war 
that was his whole war 
is is 
i 'm not satisfied with what iraq has 
i want what everybody has 
that 's right 
and and you 're right 
it 's like y- y- you see two little pre school kids fighting over a toy you know 
um-hum 
um-hum 
so i i 'm a little concerned about you know 
i know they 're putting president bush right now in uh awkward position concerning the the the treaty over there right now 
the uh the uh deal with the uh supporting the uh kurds 
you know what the what am i trying to say 
well supporting the kurds 
but um you know where the the cease fire 
right 
right 
the 
i 'm trying i forgot yeah you know because he he w- he wants them to uh uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease fire 
cease fire 
but at the same time he 's not wanting to go in and say okay i 'm going to fight your war for you which which i think is is right 
right 
you know if it 's an internal thing i do n't think we can walk in and say gee i think you 're right you 're wrong you know 
we 're not the judge and jury 
um-hum 
uh but i know that that 's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like geez y- you told us to stand up against him but you 're not helping 
got 
t- help us 
right 
and so i think he 's in a pretty awkward position now 
and i i i think we ought to help you know 
maybe supply some arms or something 
yeah 
supply arms support them if they need help 
but i do n't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them 
and and so i think he 's done good on that stance 
yeah 
i think bush handled has handled this uh whole situation quite well 
he stood up to to the bully and uh did n't back down 
yeah 
and uh and uh uh saddam hussein miscalculated all along thinking that it he would n't commit us lives and and forces and and monies to just to liberate a little country 
boy 
i would say 
that 's right 
and uh and uh then then he u- underestimated his ability to uh to uh wage a war with us 
i mean uh it 's one thing when we all came over there and said okay here we are get out and he said no i 'm i i can i can win a war with you guys 
yeah 
yeah 
and that and that was a a horrible miscalculation 
i agree 
you know they had advertised and and said news that he had the fifth largest army 
well he may have 
but you 
i mean uh not anymore 
have t- well not anymore 
but you have to have loyalty 
you have to have people who believe in your cause 
right 
you know if i- i- i- i know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is what 's honorable you know to to if you die in in a holy cause 
right 
but but i think they 're smart enough see there was nothing holy about it 
yeah 
we just wanted their land and took it 
right 
you know 
yeah he he is not a saddam hussein is not a religious person 
but he uses it when i- when he sees it to his advantage 
um sure 
sure 
and uh and i think the people were smart enough to realize that 
you know huss- that that i think they 're afraid of him is what they are 
uh 
the population i- is afraid to speak out against him 
and and uh and i do n't think he 's going to be there too much longer 
well i hope that 's true 
uh someone 's going to assassinate him you know 
i would think so 
i would think that you know 
i- i guess in the back of my mind i think like maybe the i- israeli massad probably has ideas of going in and 
i mean yeah 
yeah 
you know basically i i thought they uh showed a a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything 
yeah 
and but i do n't believe for a minute that that means that they do n't have ideas and plans of their own 
um-hum that 's right 
uh but i do agree with you 
right yeah 
i think president bush handled it all politically very smart you know getting the support of of the other arabs and other nations in the world 
and and i think that 's how you have to go into something like that 
right 
right 
i 've heard reports that uh president bush was staking his future on this uh this war and that uh setting a precedent saying that um this league of nations uh w- will always combine against bullies and and to stop this kind of stuff in the world 
any any would be bully would think twice if he knew that you know 
there 's this united nations or world government or whatever they keeps talking about with that that will that the whole world will deal with you 
well and do n't you feel 
and you can n't get aw- you just can n't do it and get away with it and you know hoping that you know 
that 's right 
because it 's a it 's a world thing 
and and and and nations will combine against you 
and uh you can n't you know can n't just do this 
and do n't you think that long term that 's been a big boost for the united nations 
oh yeah 
i mean the united nations has been there for years but all of a sudden 
had no had no teeth 
uh yeah 
there 're some teeth behind it 
and some fact that when they have sanctions and and we support things like this it means something 
right 
and i think that 's good for the strength of the united nations 
yeah people 
i uh i guess i feel sorry for just the average y- you know i- iraqi who 's had to go through all this and and suffering i 'm sure with with no water you know no electricity you know sanitation 
yeah 
and rebuild from nothing 
yes 
must be terrible living conditions must be terrible 
yeah 
and and it 's not getting any better 
the sanctions are still on 
that 's true 
you know except for a few medical supplies they 're allowing through now and uh powdered milk i guess for babies and things 
and until they 
i guess yesterday they came out with this uh these these rules i guess or whatever and they for a permanent permanent cease fire 
right 
they supported it 
and the k- kuwaitis said we do n't want to have to go repay israel for all the bombing we did that was in there you know 
um-hum that 's right 
but that 's only fair 
yeah 
they did ask that they build up uh israel and kuwait 
yeah 
and i think they should have to 
yeah 
they lost 
yeah the it 's going to be really tough for them to swallow 
but but we do n't want a kuwait there that 's also you know just has no power at all 
and and and that you know 
because iran still is n't too friendly with them 
well that 's true 
a- and we do n't want you know it 'd be be stabilized to the point where iran will say now is our chance you know go in and wipe them out 
and 
well i do n't think iran 's under the same type of madman type leadership 
yeah 
yeah 
but there 's always the possibility i guess 
yeah 
yeah 
since khomeini died over there things have got a little more n- normalized 
i think so 
not quite as radical a stance more moderates are in power now 
i think i think the person who really maybe at this time has a hard road to tow is uh jordan 's king hussein because he really kind of tried to straddle the fence 
yeah 
was put in the middle 
you know he he was n't necessarily for iraq 
at the same time he did n't feel like everybody else ought to be going against iraq 
yeah well yet so many of the his citizens are the uh the wh- wh- lebanese who who were hoping this would ge- evolve into a war against israel and uh trying to connect with israel all that time 
yeah 
right 
and there really was no connection at all 
none 
and uh but boy those lebanese i- in jordan they were saying you know this whole war is israel 's fault because israel told the united states to attack iran 
it was all you know like like israel controls our government 
i know 
and is n't that amazing the way that they 'll find their cause 
and a- and no matter what situation they see they 're going to find their cause whether it 's truly exists or not 
uh you know right 
well one thing i i did learn is i- how deep and the the hatred runs toward israel by a lot of countries 
yeah i know 
they just hate 
i mean a- anyway they can you know they can see to to to to connect them to something and hate them more 
i mean just they just 
i understand most of the land is now israel 
they bought actually purchased it and and and then moved in and started a country 
that 's true 
but see you 're also getting back to the the ages old problem of arab israel conflict as far as personalties and who 's the selected one of god 
but oh right 
and i- theirs ties in so much to their religion 
oh yeah 
right 
right 
and they both have holy holy sanc- 
and so it 's very different things than what we face 
well i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this to- 
have you been talking to males 
yeah 
yeah 
this is this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female 
i was afraid we might get into an argument 
right 
well uh i guess uh there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations for uh the roles of women 
um-hum 
and uh i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now and trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know 
right 
they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things 
yeah 
it it seems too me like though women 's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner than before 
oh i think so 
absolutely 
i- i i think it 's extremely difficult to keep up with all that uh we have to these days 
um-hum 
sometimes i think i am going crazy trying to do it 
but 
do you work outside the home 
yes 
do you have children 
uh yes 
they are getting older now 
uh-huh 
so they are not quite as much of a responsibility 
but they are still there you know 
oh sure 
they still take time 
and and i you know i still provide most of the the things that go on around the house 
right 
so uh yeah 
and for a while i was going to school to 
and tha- it was tough 
yeah 
i uh i think that while it 's a good change for i think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel you know their expertise may be 
um-hum 
uh i think sometimes other things suffer and that 
i think it 's hard to find a balance there 
but in some ways i think we are expected to do it all 
you 're almost looked down upon if you do n't try to do all of these things 
and that 's where the problem is really 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
i have little children four and one 
and i decided that it was very important to me to stay home 
uh-huh
